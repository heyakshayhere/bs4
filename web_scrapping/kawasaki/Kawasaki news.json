This is the 67th LPG carrier built by the company. This vessel is a dual-fuel LPG carrier using LPG and low-sulfur fuel oil, and their fourth 84,000 m3 LPG carrier adopting a dual-fuel main engine. In recent years, in order to effectively reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping, more vessels are adopting liquefied gases as an alternative to heavy fuel oil on a global scale. This very large LPG carrier is powered by LPG, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions and is expected to significantly reduce environmental impact. It is the fruit of the Kawasaki Group s accumulated knowledge in building LPG and liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers, and LNG-fueled vessels. Kawasaki plans to develop and build more LPG-fueled LPG carriers, LPG\/NH3 carrier, and other commercial vessels that meet environmental standards, as well as to develop and offer other eco-friendly marine technologies, to contribute to the establishment of a low-carbon\/decarbonized society. These products include vessels for transporting liquefied hydrogen, considered to be the next-generation energy source.

Use of LPG as fuel greatly reduces emission volumes of sulfur oxides (SOx), CO2 and other pollutants compared with use of marine fuel oil. In this way, the new vessel will meet SOx emission standards*1 which were strengthened in January 2020, and EEDI*2 Phase 3 regulations which will further strengthen CO2 emission standards. In order to satisfy restrictions on NOx Tier controls*3 emissions which is implemented by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the main engine and generator are equipped with a Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) System, An exhaust gas purification system to reduce NOx, which allows the ship to navigate in Emission Control Area (ECA). Installation of LPG fuel tanks on the ship's upper deck makes it possible to load fuel-use LPG separate from the ship's cargo LPG. Moreover, a piping system connecting the LPG fuel tanks and LPG cargo tanks enables transferring of extra LPG to the LPG fuel tanks if necessary. This Vessel has successfully achieved very flexible and practical design through the combination of shallow draft hull form and high compatibility with terminals and their land facility as the result of complying with OCIMF Mooring Equipment Guidance 4th Edition and ExxonMobil Criteria MESQAC 2017 as practical as possible. This vessel adopts the Kawasaki rudder bulb system with fins (RBS-F) and the semi-duct system with contra fins (SDS-F) which contribute to reducing fuel consumption. Remarks *1 SOx emission standards:Since January 2015, SOx emission restrictions in North American and European emission control areas (ECAs) have limited sulfur content in fuels to 0.1% or less. Starting in January 2020, regulations have required ships operating in all other parts of the world to use fuel with sulfur content levels of 0.5% or less, or alternatively use equipment to reduce SOx in exhaust gases to an equivalent level. *2 Energy Efficiency Design Index:Compulsory international regulations requiring energy-efficiency compliance in newly built ships based on EEDI values, which specify CO2 emissions in grams for transporting one ton of cargo for one mile. EEDI regulation values apply in increasingly strict phases based on the construction-contract conclusion date and finished-ship delivery date. Phase 3 regulations (30% CO2 emissions reduction compared with baseline levels) will be introduced for certain ship types including large LPG carriers and LNG carriers contracted to be built in 2022 or later. *3 The Tier III controls apply only to the specified ships while operating in Emission Control Areas (ECA), requiring 80% NOx emissions reduction compared with Tier controls.

Tokyo, June 7, 2022 Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. (hereinafter Kawasaki ) announced today that it was discovered that acts which include inappropriate conduct had been performed in tests of certain absorption chillers manufactured and sold mainly for air-conditioning systems in buildings by Kawasaki Thermal Engineering Co., Ltd. (hereinafter KTE ), which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kawasaki in August 2021. The following is a report of the relevant content and subsequent responses. We recognize that the acts impair the trust of KTE and sincerely apologize for the significant inconvenience we may have caused our customers and concerned parties. We confirmed the acts of inappropriate conduct do not have any impacts on the safety of our absorption chillers and the performance of the product is within the allowable performance tolerance as defined by the Japanese Industrial Standards (hereinafter JIS Standards )*1 for the indicated performance for the models currently being sold. In order to ensure that events such as these acts do not occur again in the future, a thorough investigation to determine its underlying causes will be conducted by a special investigation committee formed from third parties. In addition to carrying out corrective measures, we will further strengthen the test management system and compliance structures of the entire Kawasaki Group, and will strive to carry out recurrence prevention efforts. As we implement customer support and corrective measures from here on, if there are any impacts on our business performance related to this matter that can be anticipated, we will announce them officially as soon as possible. 1. Performance and quality of absorption chillers currently being sold Since absorption chillers from KTE are manufactured in succession using identical designs (mass-produced), their performance is confirmed through performance tests*2 of first production articles (prototypes or initial units), and their quality is verified by pre-shipment commissioning carried out at plants on each mass-produced machine, so the performance and quality of all products to be sold are ensured. While performance tests on first production articles confirm that the values specified by the JIS Standards for the refrigeration capacity (hereinafter cooling capacity )*3 and Coefficient of Performance (hereinafter COP )*4 are fulfilled by carrying out commissioning at 100% cooling capacity, pre-shipment commissioning performed on each mass-produced machine consists of commissioning at roughly 90% cooling capacity required for operational confirmation and equipment adjustment. The reason for this is that in order to reach 100% cooling capacity after production, 30 to 50 hours of break-in operation are required, but since the prescribed performance is confirmed by performance tests of first production articles, we have determined the performance and quality of products can be ensured by pre-shipment commissioning at roughly 90% cooling capacity based on past performance data. (1) Acts committed during pre-shipment commissioning [1] Indication of data which was not actually measured on inspection reports [Duration] 1984 2022 [Number of cases] 1,950 In cases where pre-shipment commissioning at 100% cooling capacity was requested by customers, explanations should have been provided to customers stating: Data at 100% cooling capacity has been confirmed by performance tests on first production articles, and quality has been confirmed through pre-shipment commissioning by commissioning at roughly 90% cooling capacity, so it is not necessary to perform tests again at 100% cooling capacity. However, data was instead prepared to serve as the results of commissioning at 100% cooling capacity, and that data was indicated on inspection reports. [2] Inappropriate operation of measuring instruments during witness tests [Duration] 1984 2022 [Number of cases] 334 out of the 1,950 cases indicated in [1] above When tests were conducted under witness by customers in addition to submission of the inspection reports indicated in [1] above, even though operation at 100% cooling capacity was not performed, measuring instruments were adjusted to make it appear that operation at 100% cooling capacity was performed, and explanations that differed from the facts were given to customers. (2) Inappropriate indications in catalogs and specifications [Duration] 1986 2009 [Number of applicable models] 6 *5 [Number of units currently in operation] 2,944 The JIS Standards for absorption chillers were established in 1986, and included specified criteria for performance (cooling capacity and COP). The cooling capacity and COP of some of the products being sold at that time did not meet the rated value which was the performance tolerance according to the JIS Standards, but were made available for sale with statements indicating compliance with the JIS Standards in their catalogs and specifications. By 2009, however, sales of the applicable models had been discontinued. At the end of August 2021, a representative from the After-Sales Service Division noticed that the inspection reports submitted to customers by KTE differed from the internal test results, and reported the matter to a supervisor. Item 2 (1) [1] indicated above was then discovered. After receiving that report, KTE started the investigation into the status of submitted inspection reports (past 5-year period, roughly 1,500 units), and after item 2 (1) [2] indicated above was confirmed, it was verified that the performance of models currently being sold is within the performance tolerances of the JIS Standards. Also, investigations were conducted on models currently in operation (roughly 9,600 units). Under the premise of providing individual explanations to customers, corrective measures and policies for response by explanations were considered, and relevant materials were prepared. In March 2022, item 2 (2) indicated above was further discovered during the course of internal investigations, and since a general grasp of the relevant acts of inappropriate conduct had been achieved, reports were provided to the business division under the jurisdiction of parent company Kawasaki (Energy Solution & Marine Engineering Company). After this, Kawasaki has requested KTE for additional detailed investigations and has also conducted other measures including interviews to ascertain the situation. [1] Purpose To carry out detailed investigations of the facts related to the acts of inappropriate conduct, determine their causes, validate and verify corrective measures, and provide recommendations on recurrence prevention. [2] Members Mori Hamada & Matsumoto: Attorney Yasuhiko Fujitsu (Chairperson) Explanations on the content of this matter will be provided from KTE to customers who received deliveries of products subject to the acts of inappropriate conduct, and a sincere stance will be taken to provide responses through individual consultations and discussions. Also, although corrective measures will be executed based on the results of investigation by the special investigation committee, the following steps will be implemented in advance. (already partially completed at this time) [1] Responses by KTE Information on the performance and quality of absorption chillers will be communicated internally as well to outside parties. Internal compliance activities will be strengthened. [2] Responses by Kawasaki Group The Kawasaki Group will treat these acts of inappropriate conduct committed by a company affiliated with the Group as an extremely serious matter, and will thoroughly enforce compliance by implementing inspections related to compliance violations throughout the entire Group once again, with the Compliance Committees of all companies assuming a central role.

Kawasaki has delivered many propulsion marine main boilers for liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers. Based on these technologies, it has developed its own hydrogen combustion technology for the new hydrogen marine main boiler. The boiler design incorporates particular technologies required for marine main boilers such as a structural design for vessel motion and compactness, distinguishing it from small once-through hydrogen boiler for land use. Kawasaki has already obtained approval in principle (AiP) from Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (ClassNK) for liquefied hydrogen carriers equipped with this boiler as the propulsion system. https:\/\/global.kawasaki.com\/en\/corp\/newsroom\/news\/detail\/?f=20220422_3378 As a demonstration of one of the core technologies of this boiler, in 2021 Kawasaki conducted a combustion test at a full-scale burner test station. This demonstration verified the high turndown ratio*1 compared with conventional LNG combustion burners. The main features of Kawasaki s hydrogen marine main boiler are as follows: Reliable and stable operationThe basic design of the boiler furnace utilizes the combustion properties of hydrogen (high combustion temperature and speed), while applying the existing proven technical design of LNG-fired propulsion marine main boilers. Therefore, this boiler delivers reliable, long-term stable operation without requiring specific additional operations. Flexible response to load changesMarine main boilers must offer flexible operation under changing load to match fluctuations in sailing speed. This boiler features our outstanding hydrogen combustion technologies and know-how including combustion analysis refined through the development of hydrogen gas turbines. Flexible operation with several fuelsThe fuel of the boiler can be changed according to vessel operation mode. It allows mono-firing of hydrogen or low-sulfur fuels, as well as dual-firing. Safe and stable operationThe technical advantages of our original hydrogen combustion burner ensure safe and stable operation of the hydrogen boiler. The burner design is based on a proven burner for LNG combustion, and ensures specified hydrogen-specific combustion properties, with safety considerations to prevent burnout and backfire. This boiler, together with the steam turbine plant and fuel supply system, will be used in the dual fuel propulsion system of large-sized liquefied hydrogen carriers. The boiler can efficiently use boil-off gas (BOG) as fuel, which is generated by heat ingress during bulk transport of cryogenic liquefied hydrogen. Kawasaki plans to release this boiler for large-sized liquefied hydrogen carriers by the mid-2020s, and will continue to offer optimal boiler solutions to meet the growing demand for hydrogen in order to realize a sustainable and secure energy transition. Furthermore, this marine main boiler technology can be used to upgrade gas-fired land boilers that use LNG, as well as several types of gases such as low calorific gas, BFG\/COG, sour gas or associated gas. Hydrogen is expected to become a key energy source in many industries including oil & gas and chemicals, both in Japan and around the world, in order to decarbonize economic systems in the near future. For these industries, we will propose power systems utilizing our hydrogen fired boiler technologies for large-scale boiler plants, hydrogen mono-fired or dual-fired with LNG. Kawasaki is paving the way for the hydrogen supply chain encompassing production, transportation, storage and utilization. This boiler will help realize the transportation and utilization of hydrogen.

The gas turbine generator set GPB300 \/ L30A with an electrical power output of 34 MWel. will be used to reelectrify hydrogen. H2GT-Lingen will be one of the world s first pilots to test 100% hydrogen-to-power conversion on an industrial scale turbine. In order to become climate-neutral by 2040, RWE is planning to switch its gas-fired power plants from natural gas to hydrogen over time, as one option for decarbonisation. With H2GT-Lingen, RWE is gaining experience in operating a hydrogen-fired turbine. At the site of its gas-fired power plant in Lingen, RWE intends to generate green hydrogen with electrolysers powered by renewable electricity. The company is planning to build a first 100-MW electrolysis plant in Lingen by 2024, which is to be expanded to 2 GW by the end of the decade. Kawasaki s gas turbine provides the maximum possible fuel flexibility. It can operate with 100% hydrogen, 100% natural gas and with any combination of both. This flexibility will be indispensable, as during the initial phase the amount of hydrogen available for reconversion will fluctuate over time before 100% hydrogen operation will be possible throughout. Kawasaki has developed two different types of combustion systems to achieve 100% hydrogen operation. One is a diffusion flame, the other a Dry-Low-Emission (DLE) combustor. In the beginning, the diffusion flame combustor will be used for the H2GT- Lingen project. The diffusion flame combustor will use water injection to achieve low emissions. In a subsequent phase, the installed diffusion flame combustor will be replaced by a Micro-Mix DLE combustor (MMX-combustor). Using hydrogen in conventional DLE combustors increases NOx emissions and heightens the risk of flashbacks. Hence established gas turbine DLE combustion systems cannot be directly used. The development of DLE hydrogen combustion technologies is thus essential for pure hydrogen (100 Vol%) combustion and Kawasaki has therefore developed the innovative and unique MMX-DLE combustor. The hydrogen combustors that have been developed were successfully tested in 2018 as part of the demonstration power plant project Hydrogen CGS for Smart Community at Kobe for the 1 MW gas turbine category in Japan. The H2GT-Lingen project aims to scale up these proven technology principles. The hydrogen-powered gas turbine is scheduled to be operational in mid-2024. Kawasaki L30A The rapid global expansion of renewable energies over the past few decades has led to new challenges for conventional power generation systems. To manage the intermittency of renewable energy, flexible power generation systems and energy storage systems are becoming increasingly important. During the transition period, gas turbine technologies will play a vital role in stabilising power supply. Accordingly, in the course of the H2GT-Lingen project different operational load ranges between 30% and 100% will be tested to increase operation flexibility. This will become very important to compensate for fluctuations in the grid resulting from the volatile availability of renewable energies. Recently it has become essential to pay full attention to de-carbonisation and sustainability in all industrial sectors. Hydrogen, produced using wind and solar energy, can replace climate-damaging fossil fuels as an alternative for gas turbines, thus enabling low-emission power generation in the future. Both RWE and Kawasaki are thus convinced that hydrogen fuels will be key components of a sustainable de-carbonised society. The H2GT-Lingen project will demonstrate the suitability and importance of hydrogen fueled gas turbines for the global energy transition. RWE Generation SE With its power plants in Germany, the UK and the Netherlands, the approximately 3,000 employees of RWE Generation produce electricity primarily from gas, hydropower and biomass. The company ranks second in Europe with its gas-fired power plants. The RWE Group bundles its hydrogen activities in RWE Generation. RWE is driving forward more than 30 projects in the field of hydrogen with partners from industry and science. Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.
