Following an intensive review process the European Space Agency ESA has confirmed that the preliminary design of the satellite meets all system requirements.  CRISTAL will carry an advanced multi-frequency altimeter that will measure sea ice thickness and ice sheet elevations - key climate change indicators. The CRISTAL altimeter will for the first time measure snow coverage of the ice sheets which will improve data quality significantly compared to its predecessor CryoSat-2. These data will support maritime operations in polar oceans and contribute to a better understanding of climate processes.  The Preliminary Design Review (PDR) was organised using a new more collaborative format. As a first step an extensive review by over 60 ESA engineers of a comprehensive data package, established by more than 100 engineers led by Airbus took place over four weeks. In a second step the major findings were intensively discussed in an interactive way between senior level experts both on ESA and Industry side up to the successful completion of the review.  CRISTAL will also support applications related to coastal and inland waters and the observation of ocean topography. The mission will ensure the long-term continuation of radar altimetry ice elevation and topographic change records, following on from previous missions such as ESA\u2019s Earth Explorer CryoSat, also developed by Airbus and working flawlessly for 12 years, well beyond its design lifetime. Monitoring the cryosphere is essential to fully assess, predict and adapt to climate variability and change.  The 1.7 ton spacecraft is based on a proven, robust Airbus satellite design building on the heritage from Sentinel-6 and CryoSat. Six fixed and two deployable solar arrays - 18.6 m\u00b2 in total - ensure enough power on CRISTAL\u00b4s drifting polar orbit at 699 km above the Earth. Its on-board memory will be able to store up to 4 terabits of science data at once, providing scientists with a wealth of information during its 7.5 year lifetime.  The Airbus Defence and Space site in Friedrichshafen (Germany) is heading an industrial consortium involving companies from 19 countries to deliver the project, including Thales Alenia Space to provide the IRIS Interferometric Radar Altimeter. Following the successful PDR the CRISTAL project is now on track for the Critical Design Review (CDR) scheduled for May 2024. The satellite platform and instrument will then be integrated and tested in the new, highly digitalised integration centre at Airbus in Friedrichshafen. CRISTAL is currently scheduled for launch from the European spaceport in Kourou in 2027.","5":"Airbus has signed a follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) contract with the U.S. Army to provide spare parts, material, and engineering support for the Army\u2019s entire UH-72A and UH-72 B Lakota fleet of 482 utility and training helicopters.Grand Prairie, Texas - Airbus has signed a follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) contract with the U.S. Army to provide spare parts, material, and engineering support for the Army\u2019s entire UH-72A and UH-72 B Lakota fleet of 482 utility and training helicopters.

This includes National Guard bases in 43 states, and Fort Rucker in Alabama, where the UH-72A performs the Army\u2019s Initial Entry Rotary Wing mission (IERW).  The CLS contract with the U.S. Army is the largest helicopter performance-based support contract managed by Airbus worldwide.  \u201cAirbus has provided exceptional product and support services in the UH-72A for nearly two decades,\u201d said COL Calvin Lane, U.S. Army Utility Project Manager. \u201cThis contract underscores the Army\u2019s trust in the aircraft\u2019s capabilities, and we look forward to the continued support this contract provides to the UH-72 fleet.\u201d  \u201cWe are honored to be extending our relationship with the U.S. Army for another 5 years. Airbus continues to prove its commitment to providing high-quality platforms and outstanding support to the men and women who fly these exceptional aircraft,\u201d said Scott Tumpak, Vice President of Military Helicopters division at Airbus in the U.S. \u201cWe are proud of our more than 15-year record of providing excellent service and hope to continue this partnership for many years to come,\u201d he added.  The UH-72B is produced at Airbus\u2019 facility in Columbus, Mississippi while logistics are managed from the facility in Dallas, Texas. The workforce supporting these platforms is approximately 40% U.S. military veterans.  The U.S. Army utilizes the UH-72A and UH-72B models to perform a variety of missions including the counter drug and southwest border missions for the Army\u2019s National Guard.  Last year, the UH-72 Lakota fleet exceeded the 1 million flight-hour mark, some 15 years after the first Lakota UH-72A entered service with the U.S. Army. The Lakota platform is a highly capable, twin-engine aircraft with modern glass-cockpit, flight control, and navigation systems. The Lakota remains the Army\u2019s lowest cost twin-engine helicopter to buy, own and operate.","6":"Airbus has been awarded a contract from the European Space Agency (ESA) to further develop the implementation of LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), one of the most ambitious science missions ESA has planned to date.Friedrichshafen, 19 May 2022 - Airbus has been awarded a contract from the European Space Agency (ESA) to further develop the implementation of LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), one of the most ambitious science missions ESA has planned to date. With Phase B1 now underway, the detailed mission design and final technology development activities for the gravitational wave observatory are due to be completed by 2024, with launch planned for the late 2030s.  Gravitational waves were first postulated by Albert Einstein. They are distortions in space-time, created when for example supermassive black holes - billions of times heavier than our sun - merge. These events are so powerful that the resulting gravitational waves can be measured by sensitive instruments from billions of light years away.  To measure these waves, LISA consists of three spacecraft that form an equilateral triangle deep in space, 2.5 million kilometres apart from each other. Gravitational waves stretch and compress space-time, causing the tiniest changes in distance between the LISA probes (less than the diameter of an atom). Any movements of test masses that free-fall inside the three spacecraft when a gravitational wave passes can be detected by the spacecrafts\u2019 sensitive instruments. LISA will do this by using lasers that continuously transmit back and forth between the satellites using interferometry, measuring the distance between each of the test masses.  Some of the key technologies required for LISA were successfully tested in space with the LISA Pathfinder (LPF) mission developed and built by Airbus as prime. The mission results showed that LPF operated even more precisely than required for LISA. LPF was launched on 3rd December 2015 and ended in July 2017.  Gravitational waves are a new research method that uses gravity instead of light to measure dynamic processes in the universe. The study of gravitational waves offers enormous potential for discovering parts of the universe that are invisible in other ways. LISA will significantly expand our knowledge of the beginning, evolution, and structure of our universe. Gravitational waves have been detected by ground-based observatories in recent years \u2013 by experiments such as LIGO and the European Virgo observatory \u2013 but these facilities are limited in size and sensitivity, meaning that they are only able to detect high-frequency gravitational waves from particular sources (such as merging stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars).","7":"Toulouse, 18 May 2022 - The last two satellites of the Airbus-built, owned and operated Pl\u00e9iades Neo constellation are on track for launch later this year, following successful final tests in Toulouse\u2019s clean rooms.Toulouse, 18 May 2022 - The last two satellites of the Airbus-built, owned and operated Pl\u00e9iades Neo constellation are on track for launch later this year, following successful final tests in Toulouse\u2019s clean rooms.  Following the seamless parallel integration of both Pl\u00e9iades Neo 5 and 6 satellites, and the successful conclusion of the environment (thermal vacuum, acoustic, vibration) test campaign, both final spacecraft are now ready to complete the Pl\u00e9iades Neo constellation.  Both satellites are due to be launched simultaneously on the Vega C European launcher from Kourou, in French Guiana. To tackle this dual launch, the Airbus space engineers came up with a smart and efficient dispenser-free design, where the satellites are stacked on top of each other, linked only by a clamp band.  This compact dispenser-free launch configuration saves volume and mass, as well as reducing cost. Simultaneously testing both satellites in their stacked launch configuration enabled significant time saving, with only four days needed to pass both the three axes Sine testing and the acoustic test.  \u201dWith this new bold, dispenser-free design, we were able to seamlessly integrate and test these two very high resolution satellites and ensure an optimised launch configuration: in a single launch, we will double the acquisition capacity of the Pl\u00e9iades Neo constellation, and offer even greater responsiveness to our customers\u201d said Philippe Pham, Head of Earth Observation and Science at Airbus.  Comprising four identical satellites, the Pl\u00e9iades Neo constellation will work hand in hand with the existing Pl\u00e9iades satellites and the rest of the Airbus Earth observation satellite fleet. The highly compact Pl\u00e9iades Neo spacecraft have a light weight, next generation silicon carbide optical instrument. They also have laser comms inter-satellite links with SpaceDataHighway (EDRS) geostationary satellites to enable urgent acquisitions in just 30 to 40 minutes following a tasking request to swiftly respond to the most critical situations.

Used to improve the performance of navigation satellite systems for the most safety-critical applications such as aircraft navigation and landing, the European GeostationaryNavigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) is Europe's regional Satellite-Based Augmentation System (SBAS). This new V3 generation of EGNOS, currently under development by Airbus, will introduce new services based on multiple frequencies of multiple constellations (GPS, Galileo), and will embed sophisticated security protection against cyber-attacks.  The assessment of the system performance for initial services highlighted the high level of maturity of the design and its adequacy to flawlessly continue the provision of critical navigation services, such as precision approach and landing everywhere in Europe, irrespective of whether the airports are equipped with expensive instrument landing systems (which is often not the case for smaller ones). The review confirmed EGNOS V3 will deliver the accuracy, continuity, integrity and availability required for Safety-of-Life operations up to Cat.I - with margins.  \u201cAt this stage of the development, this performance review has demonstrated the increase in benefits which EGNOS V3 should bring to Europe,\u201d said Didier Flament, Head of EGNOS & SBAS Division at ESA. \u201cAs the full power of this new EGNOS generation has still to be qualified in the following phase of the project, this first important milestone of the Detailed Design phase has met our expectations on all legacy aspects assessed. We look forward to the next steps, as we are confident that EGNOS V3 will deliver as required.\u201d  In addition, using both Galileo and GPS signals to monitor ionosphere-induced position errors increases the availability of the service in the western and southwestern periphery of Europe. This expands the area in which satellite navigation landing becomes possible without requiring dedicated ground systems.  \u201cThe consolidation of EGNOS\u2019 service area will be beneficial to our customers, as it will support their satellite navigation-guided operations to even more destinations,\u201d commented Hugues de Beco, head of ATM Programs within Airbus Commercial Aircraft. \u201cAirbus is very pleased to support the growth of EGNOS users in commercial aviation in Europe with the recent certification of the SBAS Landing Systems on Airbus A320 and A330 families. We continue to support the development of any system which will contribute to a safer and more sustainable air traffic.\u201d    Background    EGNOS is a component of the European Union Space Programme designed to improve positioning service of the Global Positioning System and of Galileo for Safety of Life users.

More recently, with MetOp satellites, it has been used to study unusual weather phenomena such as El Ni\u00f1o, the long-term effects of deforestation and changes in sea-ice masses around the poles. All of which play a central role in monitoring climate change.  The MetOp-SG SAT-B series of satellites focus on the use of microwave sensors that will provide: enhanced infrared, microwave and radio occultation temperature and humidity soundings; polar atmospheric motion vectors extracted from optical images; new precipitation and cloud measurements from images in the optical, submillimetre and microwave spectra; and high-resolution measurements of ocean surface wind vector and soil moisture extracted from scatterometer observations. These data will help improve numerical weather prediction - the backbone of our daily weather forecasts - regionally and globally.  The first launch of the MetOp-SG mission is scheduled for 2024 after completion of integration and satellite level testing. The nominal operational lifetime of each of the three MetOp-SG satellites is 7.5 years, ensuring full operational coverage over a 21-year period.","28":"Eurowings has taken delivery of its first Airbus A320neo aircraft featuring the new Airspace cabin design.Toulouse, 05 April 2022 \u2013 Eurowings has taken delivery of its first Airbus A320neo aircraft featuring the new Airspace cabin design.

Airbus\u2019 A380 test aircraft MSN 1 took off from Blagnac Airport, Toulouse, France at 08h43 on Friday 25 March. The flight lasted about three hours, operating one Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine on 100% SAF. 27 tonnes of unblended SAF were provided by TotalEnergies for this flight. The SAF produced in Normandy, close to Le Havre, France, was made from Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), free of aromatics and sulphur, and primarily consisting of used cooking oil, as well as other waste fats. A second flight, with the same aircraft, is scheduled to take place from Toulouse to Nice Airport, on the 29 March to test the use of SAF during take-off and landing. This is the third Airbus aircraft type to fly on 100% SAF over the course of 12 months; the first was an Airbus A350 in March 2021 followed by an A319neo single-aisle aircraft in October 2021.  Increasing the use of SAF remains a key pathway to achieving the industry\u2019s ambition of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Key statistics outlined in the Waypoint 2050 report indicate that SAF could contribute between 53% and 71% of required carbon reductions. All Airbus aircraft are currently certified to fly with up to a 50% blend of SAF mixed with kerosene. The aim is to achieve certification of 100% SAF by the end of this decade. The A380 aircraft used during the test is the same aircraft recently revealed as Airbus\u2019 ZEROe Demonstrator - a flying testbed for future technologies instrumental to bringing the world\u2019s first zero-emission aircraft to market by 2035. @Airbus #A380 #SAF #SustainableAviation Your contact Matthieu Duvelleroy External Communications - Airbus Phone: +33 6 29 43 15 64 matthieu.duvelleroy@airbus.com Lois Benquet External Communications - Airbus Commercial Aircraft Phone: +33 6 42 88 10 65 lois.benquet@airbus.com Airbus Press releases Register to receive Airbus' latest press releases Sign up","31":"Hyderabad, 26 March 2022 \u2013 Himalayan Heli Services Pvt.

Trials were conducted using an optionally piloted vehicle (OPV) based on a modified Guimbal Cabri G2 equipped with the autonomous take-off and landing (ATOL) system developed for the VSR700. This flight test campaign paves the way for the upcoming demonstration of the VSR700, at sea, onboard a French Navy frigate.  \u201cThese tests in real-life conditions constitute a crucial step towards the campaign that we will conduct at sea with the DGA and the French Navy later this year,\u201d explained Nicolas Delmas, head of the VSR700 programme for Airbus Helicopters. \u201cUsing the OPV, we have demonstrated the unique autonomous take-off and landing capabilities of the VSR700. We have also proved the optimal functioning of the vehicle and its command station interface on board a vessel in realistic conditions.\u201d  The test campaign was conducted off the coast of Brest, France, onboard a civilian vessel equipped with a helicopter landing deck in the presence of experts from the DGA. Beyond demonstrating the ATOL system developed for the VSR700, the trials were also used to assess the approach procedures before landing on the vessel. The VSR700 flight envelope at sea, in proximity to a vessel, was tested in line with development objectives and was confirmed to be fully compatible with naval operations. Both the semi-autonomous and the fully autonomous modes of the ATOL system were demonstrated with success in different sea states. The VSR700 uses Airbus DeckFinder to enable autonomous ship deck take off and landings in all weather conditions, during the day or night. In total, 150 autonomous launches and recoveries took place. The handling and maneuvering of the OPV, representative of the VSR700, on the ship deck were also tested.  The OPV can carry one test pilot in order to enable safer and more agile initial testing before those systems are integrated into the fully autonomous VSR700. The OPV initially conducted piloted take-offs and landings before switching progressively to fully autonomous maneuvers.  Designed to operate alongside other shipborne naval assets, the VSR700 is a UAS in the 500-1,000 kg maximum take off weight range. It offers the best balance of payload capability, endurance and operational cost. It is capable of carrying multiple full-size naval sensors for extended periods and can operate from existing ships, alongside a helicopter, with a low logistical footprint.  The first prototype of the VSR700 performed its maiden flight in 2020 and expanded its flight envelope in 2021. In April 2021, the DGA ordered a second prototype of the VSR700 to focus on trials covering SDAM requirements and to permit broader, more rapid development towards that goal. @AirbusHeli @MarineNationale @DGA #VSR700 Your contact Laurence Petiard Head of External Communications - Airbus Helicopters Phone: +33 6 18 79 75 69 laurence.petiard@airbus.com Emmanuel Huberdeau Airbus Helicopters Phone: +33 (0)6 17 27 93 31 emmanuel.huberdeau@airbus.com","37":"Passenger traffic to grow at 6.2% annually over the next two decades Fleet will need 1,770 new small* and 440 medium and large** aircraft India will need additional 34,000 pilots; 45,000 technicians by 2040 Hyderabad, March 24, 2022: India will require 2,210 new aircraft over the next 20 years, according to Airbus\u2019 latest India Market Forecast.

The SMILE STM payload is now on its way to Luxembourg from where it will start its journey to Shanghai. On arrival it will be integrated onto the Chinese platform, to complete the qualification of the satellite. \u201cThis is the first time that ESA and China have jointly selected, designed, implemented, launched and operated a space mission and Airbus is very pleased to be part of it,\u201d said Philippe Pham, Head of Earth Observation and Science at Airbus. \u201cUnderstanding space weather is key to being able to predict events that can affect our planet's magnetosphere, satellites in orbit and even electrical infrastructure here on Earth.\u201d The STM payload module returned to Airbus in Spain after completing thermal testing and deployment tests of the magnetometer\u2019s boom at ESA-ESTEC, in the Netherlands. A mechanical test was then carried out at Airbus\u2019 Madrid-Barajas site, finalizing the environmental test campaign that lasted three months.  Integration onto the Chinese platform is expected to begin in early April. Once the complete satellite is finished, it will undergo a comprehensive five month long qualification test campaign including thermal, mechanical, EMC, magnetic, deployment and functional tests at system level. Airbus will give remote support. SMILE will study the Earth\u2019s magnetic environment (magnetosphere) on a global scale, building a more complete understanding of the Sun-Earth interaction. It will do this by observing the flow of charged particles streaming out from the Sun into interplanetary space (the solar wind) and exploring how these interact with the space around our planet. This interaction is also called space weather. SMILE is the first joint European-Chinese mission. ESA is responsible for the Payload Module, the launch vehicle, one of the scientific instruments and part of the science operations, while the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) is responsible for three scientific instruments, the platform, and the mission and science operations. Airbus delivered the STM model of the SMILE PLM on time in line with ESA and CAS\u2019 requirements. ESA selected Airbus in Spain in July 2019 as the main contractor of the SMILE payload, the European component. The launch of the mission is scheduled for late 2024 or early 2025 from Europe\u2019s Spaceport in Kourou. The SMILE mission will have a lifetime of three years and builds upon findings and studies by ESA satellites such as Cluster and XMM-Newton, also built by Airbus. @AirbusSpace @esascience #SpaceWeather @CDTIoficial #SpaceMatters Your contact Ralph Heinrich Head of External Communications - Airbus Space Systems Phone: +49 171 304 9751 ralph.heinrich@airbus.com Jeremy Close External Communications - Airbus Space Systems, UK Phone: +44 776 653 6572 jeremy.close@airbus.com Francisco Lech\u00f3n External Communications - Airbus Space Systems, Spain Phone: +34 630 196 993 francisco.lechon@airbus.com Guilhem Boltz External Communications - Airbus Space Systems, France Phone: +33 6 34 78 14 08 guilhem.g.boltz@airbus.com Mathias Pikelj Communications - Airbus Defence & Space Phone: +49 162 294 9666 mathias.pikelj@airbus.com Subscribe today to the Discovery Space Learning Guides Sign up now!","41":"New Delhi, March 16 2022 - The Airbus A350, the undisputed leader in sustainable long-range air travel, will be the focus of attention at the Wings India airshow to be held at Begumpet Airport in Hyderabad from March 24 to 27, 2022.

Operators will be matched to the best combination of services according to their profile and fleet make-up.  Simplified to just three flexible solutions, HCare is now composed of HCare Initial, HCare In-service, or a combination of the two, HCare Lifetime. For each, customers can opt for one out of three levels of material management performance. Still available for specific fleets will be the HCare First package for Airbus Corporate Helicopters (ACH) aircraft and HCare Classics for the out-of-production legacy fleet (H120, Dauphin, Puma and Gazelle). \u201cEach operator is unique with differing organisational structures, operating environments and constraints. They may be new or regular users of Airbus helicopters, high or moderate flyers, have small or large fleets, and perform single or multiple missions,\u201d says Christoph Zammert, Executive Vice President of Customer Support & Services at Airbus Helicopters. \u201cOur new customer-centric offer results from listening to our customers and reshaping our structure to be more flexible and adapted to their expectations, wherever they are in their own journey or their relationship with Airbus.\u201d HCare Initial is tailored for customers starting operations with a new Airbus helicopter or taking delivery of a new aircraft type in their fleet. It provides the best set of services for a successful entry into service.  HCare In-service is for customers already operating an Airbus helicopter type. Matching services to operators\u2019 needs, it optimises the aircraft\u2019s maintenance, health and usage, and longevity. HCare Lifetime is for operators opting for an end-to-end package and long-term collaboration with Airbus, from entry into service up to the aircraft\u2019s end of life. This global support contract aims to maximise the aircraft\u2019s performance and sustained value over time, while enhancing safety and providing successive, sustained support. Customers receive daily care and accompaniment at all steps of their operations.   For the material management portion of each contract, customers select the commitment level. Guaranteed repair secures R&O Turn-Around-Times by contract to improve maintenance planning with flexible payment conditions. By-the-hour offers a smooth distribution of expenses and budget anticipation. By-event requires payment at the time of the repair or the overhaul. Part availability commits Airbus Helicopters on parts delivery lead times while giving the operator a precise view of the necessary maintenance budget; for current customers, it resembles the by-the-hour contracts many are familiar with covering scheduled and unscheduled maintenance events. The part availability solution is built upon fixed hourly rate payments to make maintenance expenses predictable. Fleet availability, the third level of commitment, augments part availability with maintenance delegated to Airbus for optimal aircraft availability, based on fixed hourly and monthly rates.  Completing the offer is the option to order one-off services directly from the HCare Store, which covers Material Management, Helicopter Maintenance, Technical Support, Training & Flight Ops and Connected Services. It is available online on AirbusWorld. Learn more about the new HCare offer at https:\/\/www.airbus.com\/en\/products-services\/helicopters\/hcare-services.

By enlarging its ab-initio training base, Airbus reaffirms its longstanding commitment to support its airline customers in anticipating and preparing for the future. In helping to train the pilots of tomorrow, a demand now estimated to be around 550,000 over the next 20 years*, Airbus is ensuring the commercial aircraft industry is ready for air traffic recovery in the 2023-2025 timeframe and the years beyond. The move to a new campus is also the opportunity for AFAE to commit to and align with Airbus\u2019 global approach to sustainability. A first step was the achievement of ISO 14001 certification for the site in 2021. AFAE now turns its efforts to focusing on a reduction of CO\u2082 emissions of its training aircraft fleet -an order for the more fuel efficient, quieter Elixir light aircraft is ongoing to complement the current Cirrus fleet, as well as ensuring a decarbonised environmental footprint in terms of its physical sites and supply chain.  Going forward AFAE stands ready to adapt its operations in line with Airbus\u2019 long term zero-emission ambition, all the while ensuring that it maintains the comprehensive and innovative approach to training that Airbus has been renowned for over the past 50 years, via the regular introduction of the latest technologies and learning concepts, including environmental education from Day1.  The Airbus Pilot Cadet Training Programme is open to high school graduates over 18 years old worldwide. Candidates will undergo online and on-site screening tests before being eligible for training which will include 750+ hours of ground school, plus 200 hours of practical (flight and simulator) training.   @Airbus @volotea #AirbusFlightAcademyEurope #AirbusServices #AirbusTraining #AirbusCadets   *Source: Airbus GMF 2021-2040  To find out more about the Airbus Flight Academy Europe, click here  For more information on Airbus Training Services visit https:\/\/aircraft.airbus.com Your contact Lois Benquet External Communications - Airbus Commercial Aircraft Phone: +33 6 42 88 10 65 lois.benquet@airbus.com Ambra Canale External Communications - Airbus Phone: +34 695 99 26 79 ambra.canale@airbus.com","57":"Amsterdam, 1 March 2022 \u2013 Airbus SE (stock exchange symbol: AIR) has published the agenda for its Annual General Meeting (AGM) taking place on 12 April 2022, with resolutions including the proposed appointment of a new director and the renewal of the Board mandates of Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury and two other directors. One resolution proposes the appointment of Irene Rummelhoff as a non-executive director, replacing Carlos Tavares whose Board mandate expires at the close of the AGM and hasn\u2019t sought re-election.

It is the first MALE designed from the start to meet requirements for integration into civil airspace, helping to improve efficiencies such as use of direct flight paths, without the need for pre-planned emergency landing sites, which saves time, fuel and, as a result, CO2 emissions. Eurodrone relies on Digital Design, Manufacturing and Services (DDMS), a new, digital-first approach applied by Airbus to the way aerospace products are designed, manufactured and operated throughout all product phases. Eurodrone is the first programme that will be fully designed and developed from the start through DDMS in a stepped approach and aims to benefit from better upgrade planning, improved operational availability and lower life-cycle costs.

The programme\u2019s objective is to ground and flight test a direct combustion engine  fueled by hydrogen, in preparation for entry-into-service of a zero-emission aircraft by 2035. The demonstration will use a A380 flying testbed equipped with liquid hydrogen tanks prepared at Airbus facilities in France and Germany. Airbus will also define the hydrogen propulsion system requirements, oversee flight testing, and provide the A380 platform to test the hydrogen combustion engine in cruise phase.  CFM International (CFM) will modify the combustor, fuel system, and control system of a GE Passport turbofan to run on hydrogen. The engine, which is assembled in the US, was selected for this program because of its physical size, advanced turbo machinery, and fuel flow capability. It will be mounted along the rear fuselage of the flying testbed to allow engine emissions, including contrails, to be monitored separately from those of the engines powering the aircraft. CFM will execute an extensive ground test program ahead of the A380 flight test. \u201cThis is the most significant step undertaken at Airbus to usher in a new era of hydrogen-powered flight since the unveiling of our ZEROe concepts back in September 2020,\u201d said Sabine Klauke, Airbus Chief Technical Officer. \u201cBy leveraging the expertise of American and European engine manufacturers to make progress on hydrogen combustion technology, this international partnership sends a clear message that our industry is committed to making zero-emission flight a reality.\u201d \u201cHydrogen combustion capability is one of the foundational technologies we are developing and maturing as part of the CFM RISE Program,\u201d said Ga\u00ebl M\u00e9heust, president & CEO of CFM. \u201cBringing together the collective capabilities and experience of CFM, our parent companies, and Airbus, we really do have the dream team in place to successfully demonstrate a hydrogen propulsion system.\u201d  CFM shares Airbus\u2019 ambition of fulfilling the promise they made in signing the Air Transport Action Group goal in October 2021 to achieve aviation industry net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 by developing and testing the technology necessary to make zero emissions aircraft a reality within the ambitious timeline defined. Airbus has a long-standing relationship with CFM and its parent companies, GE Aviation and Safran Aircraft Engines and, together, the partners have established a great track record of delivering high-performance products that meet the needs of airline customers.

The financial result was \u20ac -315 million (2020: \u20ac -620 million). It mainly reflects the net interest result of \u20ac -246 million as well as the revaluation of financial instruments and of certain equity investments. Consolidated net income(2) was \u20ac 4,213 million (2020 net loss: \u20ac -1,133 million) with consolidated reported earnings per share of \u20ac 5.36 (2020 loss per share: \u20ac -1.45). Consolidated free cash flow before M&A and customer financing was \u20ac 3,515 million (2020: \u20ac -6,935 million), reflecting efforts on cash containment and a decrease in working capital, mainly driven by inventory improvement. Consolidated free cash flow was \u20ac 3,511 million (2020: \u20ac -7,362 million). On 31 December 2021, the gross cash position stood at \u20ac 22.7 billion (year-end 2020: \u20ac 21.4 billion) with a consolidated net cash position of \u20ac 7.6 billion (year-end 2020: \u20ac 4.3 billion). The Company\u2019s liquidity position remains strong, standing at \u20ac 28.7 billion at the end of 2021. The Board of Directors will propose the payment of a 2021 dividend of \u20ac 1.50 per share to the 2022 Annual General Meeting. The payment date is 21 April 2022. Outlook As the basis for its 2022 guidance, the Company assumes no further disruptions to the world economy, air traffic, the Company\u2019s internal operations, and its ability to deliver products and services. The Company\u2019s 2022 guidance is before M&A. On that basis, the Company targets to achieve in 2022 around: 720 commercial aircraft deliveries; EBIT Adjusted of \u20ac 5.5 billion; Free Cash Flow before M&A and Customer Financing of \u20ac 3.5 billion.

Nearly 30% of these will replace older less fuel efficient models. In a region which is home to 55% of the world\u2019s population, China, India and emerging economies such as Vietnam and Indonesia will be the principal drivers of growth in Asia-Pacific. GDP will grow at 3.6% per year compared to the world average 2.5% and double in value by 2040. The  middle class, who are the likeliest to travel, will increase by 1.1 billion to 3.2 billion and the propensity for people to travel is set to almost triple by 2040. Of the demand for 17,620 aircraft, 13,660 are in the Small category like the A220 and A320 Family. In the medium and long range categories, Asia-Pacific will continue to drive demand with some 42% of global requirement. This translates to 2,470 Medium and 1,490 Large category aircraft. Cargo traffic in Asia-Pacific will also increase at 3.6% per annum, well above the global 3.1% average and will lead to a doubling in air freight in the region by 2040. Globally, express freight boosted by e-commerce will grow at an even faster pace of 4.7% per year. Overall, reflecting that strong growth over the next 20 years, there will be a need for some 2,440 freighters, of which 880 will be new-build. \u201cWe are seeing a global recovery in air traffic and as travel restrictions are further eased the Asia-Pacific region will become one of its main drivers again. We are confident of a strong rebound in the region\u2019s traffic and expect it to reach 2019 levels between 2023 and 2025,\u201d said Christian Scherer, Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Airbus International. \u201cWith an ever greater focus on efficiency and sustainable aviation in the region, our products are especially well positioned.\u201d \u201cOur modern portfolio offers a 20-25 % fuel burn and therewith CO2 advantage over older generation aircraft and we pride ourselves that all our aircraft products are already certified to fly with a blend of 50% SAF, set to rise to 100% by 2030. In addition, our newly launched A350F offers efficiency gains of 10 to 40% compared to any other large freighter, existing or expected, both in terms of fuel consumption as in CO2 emissions. \u201d Globally, in the next 20 years, there will be a need for some 39,000 new-build passenger and freighter aircraft, of which 15,250 will be for replacement. As a result, by 2040 the vast majority of commercial aircraft in operation will be the latest generation, up from some 13% today, considerably improving the CO2 efficiency of the world\u2019s commercial aircraft fleets. The global aviation industry has already achieved huge efficiency gains, as shown by the 53% decline in aviation\u2019s CO2 emissions per revenue passenger kilometre since 1990. Airbus\u2019 product range supports at least a 20% CO2 efficiency gain over previous-generation aircraft. In view of further ongoing innovations, product developments, operational improvements as well as market based options, Airbus has a clear ambition to achieve the air transport sector\u2019s target to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.                                                                                                    * * * Airbus Global Market Forecast categorizes aircraft into Small, Medium and Large as per slide below Your contact Sean Lee Head of Communications - Airbus Asia-Pacific Phone: +65 9654 5761 sean.lee@airbus.com Aaron Chong Communications - Airbus Asia-Pacific Phone: +65 9387 3886 aaron.chong@airbus.com Airbus Press releases Register to receive Airbus' latest press releases Sign up","70":"Singapore, 14 February 2022 \u2013 Jazeera Airways, the Kuwaiti-based carrier, has firmed up an order with Airbus for 28 aircraft, including 20 A320neos and eight A321neos.

I especially value the trust that our customers place in our people, our products, and our services to help them perform their essential missions every day.\u201d  The Company ramped up its five-bladed H145 deliveries in 2021 as well as delivered the first five-bladed H145 retrofit to DRF Luftrettung, a German helicopter emergency medical services operator, at the end of May. Other key deliveries the first H225M for Singapore in March as well as the first H225M in a naval combat configuration for Brazilian Navy, and the first NH90 TTH for Qatar which was delivered ahead of schedule. In North America, the US Army took delivery of the first UH-72B from the Airbus Helicopters factory in Columbus, Mississippi and the Lakota fleet reached the major milestone of one million flight hours.  Order highlights for 2021 consist of 93 H145s and 52 H160s including the first batch of H160Ms for the French armed forces as well as 10 H160s for the Gendarmerie Nationale \u2013 the first law enforcement customer for the model. Airbus Helicopters also expanded its partnership with The Helicopter Company in Saudi Arabia, which added 20 H145s and 6 ACH160s to their growing fleet of Airbus helicopters. The H225 saw 2021 kicking off to a good start with its long-standing customer, the Japan Coast Guard, ordering an additional two helicopters to its fleet in March. Airbus Helicopters\u2019 suite of HCare offerings continue to convince customers of their value add with new and returning customers such as Air Methods who signed an additional contract in February to cover 80 EC135s. The Company expanded its range in 2021 with HCare Classics, a custom-made set of services for its legacy fleet of approximately 2,000 in-service H120, Dauphin, Puma and Gazelle helicopters. HDataPower is an example of Airbus Helicopters\u2019 ongoing commitment to digitalisation and harnessing the benefits (time savings, higher fleet availability, optimised costs) that it can proffer to customers with Helionix-equipped aircraft by leveraging data generated by helicopter systems.  2021 was an essential and exciting year for innovation and product improvement at Airbus Helicopters. The H125 performance increase received both its EASA and FAA certification enabling operators to take full advantage of the 10% power increase provided by the Arriel 2D engines. The Company also added the H175M to its military product portfolio. The VSR700, Airbus\u2019 unmanned aerial system, began its flight envelope expansion ahead of sea trials later this year.  2021 was especially instrumental to the Company\u2019s decarbonisation roadmap. The helicopter Flightlab started flight testing new technologies, including the engine back-up system which not only aims to deliver safety improvements but is also a fundamental first step on the road to hybridisation. Airbus Helicopters also launched a SAF User Group dedicated to the rotary- wing community in an effort to accelerate the deployment of biofuels, began using sustainable aviation fuel for its training and flight tests at it main sites in France and Germany, and ended the year by flying an H225 with one engine powered by 100% SAF. One of the key highlights came in September 2021 at the Airbus Summit when Airbus Helicopters unveiled CityAirbus NextGen, its new prototype designed to deliver zero emissions flight in urban environments. The fully electric vehicle for the Urban Air Mobility market is just one of the reasons Airbus Helicopters is looking to recruit 500 people in 2022. @AirbusHeli #MakingMissionsPossible   Your contact Laurence Petiard Head of External Communications - Airbus Helicopters Phone: +33 6 18 79 75 69 laurence.petiard@airbus.com Emmanuel Huberdeau Airbus Helicopters Phone: +33 6 17 27 93 31 emmanuel.huberdeau@airbus.com Bel\u00e9n Morant Airbus Helicopters Phone: +33 6 75 81 80 70 belen.morant@airbus.com Gregor von Kursell Corporate Media Relations Germany Phone: +49 906 71 45 65 Gregor.Kursell@airbus.com J\u00f6rg Michel Airbus Helicopters Phone: +49 151 264 509 97 joerg.michel@airbus.com Kieran Daly Communications - Airbus Helicopters UK Phone: +44 777 1 38 9229 kieran.daly@airbus.com","78":"Seville, 26 January 2022 \u2013 The Airbus C295 Flight Test Bed 2 (FTB2) has successfully performed its maiden flight from the Final Assembly Line in Seville. The aircraft now starts a flight campaign with the aim of testing the new semi-morphing wing, the new affordable flight control system, as well as a SatCom antenna embedded within the aircraft\u2019s fuselage. \u201cThe first flight of the C295 FTB2 is a key milestone that represents an important step forward in the programme, following the successful integration of the new aero structures, power-on and ground tests. A few years ago this programme was just a dream of a more sustainable future for aviation. Today we are at the final stage and we finally made it fly\u201d said Francisco Javier S\u00e1nchez Segura, Executive Vice President Engineering Airbus Defence and Space. Based on the Airbus C295, the Flight Test Bed 2 is an in-flight demonstrator of the European Clean Sky 2 (CS2) and the EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, where technologies related to CS2\u2019s future regional multimission aircraft are tested. The modifications include new materials and technologies designed to achieve noise, CO2 and NOx emissions reduction. With these technologies applied in a future regional multimission configuration, up to 43% CO2 and 70% NOx reductions can be achieved in a typical Search and Rescue mission of 400 nautical miles, as well as 45% less noise during take-off. The main modifications in the aircraft are a new high-efficiency semi-morphing wing, new dynamic winglets and a flat panel SATCOM antenna integrated within the top of the fuselage.  In addition, innovative flight controls for primary control surfaces, including ailerons, flaps and flap tabs with improved aerodynamics, are capable of adjusting in-flight and contribute to a more efficient high lift system. The new flight control system leverages digital control systems to optimise the aerodynamic shape of the wing in flight, while a new multifunctional flap has been completely redesigned and includes flap tabs in the trailing edge controlled by electro-mechanical actuators. But the advantages also extend into the manufacturing process, not least with the use of advanced materials and manufacturing ranging from the use of Scalmalloy and additive manufacturing, to a new assembly method for the aero structures of the wing.  A one shot assembly approach has been used for the new composite winglet and winglet tab, moving from the conventional ribs approach to a multi-spar integrated torsion box. Finally, jig-less methods have been used for the assembly of flaps and ailerons. As a result, the C295 FTB2 brings improvements not only to the purely operational aspects of the aircraft, but helps introduce new improvement to the design and manufacturing process.

With the Columbus Ka-band (ColKa) terminal now installed and fully tested on-board the ISS, a SpaceDataHighway satellite will start to relay data via a bi-directional link in real time between the ISS Columbus Laboratory and the Columbus Control Centre located at the German Aerospace Center DLR near Munich as well as research centres across Europe. Thanks to the SpaceDataHighway and the ColKa terminal, ESA will benefit from a direct and sovereign access to the ISS, thus increasing the operational flexibility allowing more astronauts, scientists and researchers to benefit from a direct link with Europe. This will also enable ESA to create slots for ad-hoc experiment access and interaction with European astronauts. The ColKa data service provision has been contracted between ESA and Airbus. As part of this new SpaceDataHighway service, Airbus has adapted its Ka-band inter-satellite link to ensure data will be channelled via the ground station at Harwell Campus, UK. Besides this Ka-band service, the SpaceDataHighway is the world\u2019s first laser communication geostationary constellation. It represents a game changer in the speed of space communications, using cutting-edge laser technology to deliver secure data transfer services in near-real time. The system has achieved more than 50,000 successful laser connections within the first five years of routine operations. Its satellites can connect to ISS as well as low-orbiting observation satellites at a distance of up to 45,000 km. From its position in geostationary orbit, the SpaceDataHighway system relays in near real-time to Earth the collected data, a process that would normally take several hours. It therefore enables the quantity of image and video data transmitted by observation satellites to be greatly increased and their mission plan can be re-programmed at any time and in just a few minutes. With its SpaceDataHighway, Airbus is already serving four Copernicus Sentinel satellites on a daily basis and continues to expand its services to more customers. Pleiades Neo, Airbus\u2019s most advanced optical Earth Observation constellation with four 30cm resolution satellites are the next satellites to benefit from SpaceDataHighway\u2019s infrastructure and will further optimise mission reactivity providing near real time data delivery and reactive tasking capabilities. @AirbusSpace @ESA @DLR Your contact Bruno Daffix External Communications - Airbus Phone: +33 6 48 09 96 50 bruno.b.daffix@airbus.com Airbus Press releases Register to receive Airbus' latest press releases Sign up","86":"TOKYO, JAPAN, January 17, 2022 \u2013 Airbus, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT), NTT DOCOMO, INC.

The provision of space-based radio access network services using NTN technologies, collectively called Space RAN (radio access network), is expected to support worldwide mobile communications with ultra-wide coverage and improved disaster resistance as well enhanced 5G and 6G. In addition, HAPS platforms can also interconnect to the nearest terrestrial network gateway and extend the reach of existing mobile services directly to end-user devices, providing service options including rural, emergency and maritime connectivity.   With the signing of the MOU, the four companies will discuss and identify possible future developments necessary to unlock future HAPS-based connectivity services, lobby for standardization and institutionalization of HAPS operations, and explore business models for commercializing HAPS services.   Specific themes will include the applicability of HAPS for mobile connectivity on the ground and base station backhaul,1 the performance of various frequency bands in HAPS systems, the technological considerations for linking HAPS with satellites and ground base stations, and the establishment of a cooperative system to test a network combining NTN technology, satellites and HAPS.     As separately announced on November 15, 2021, DOCOMO and Airbus successfully conducted a propagation test between the ground and a \u201cZephyr S\u201d HAPS aircraft in the stratosphere, demonstrating the possibility of providing stable communication with such a configuration.   1 Base station backhaul refers to a fixed line that supports high-speed, high-capacity information transmission between a large number of wireless base stations in a mobile communications network and the core network.
