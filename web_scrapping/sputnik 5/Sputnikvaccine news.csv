As per the report, a comparative study shows that the Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine demonstrates more than two times higher titers of virus-neutralizing antibodies to Omicron variant than two doses of Pfizer vaccine (2.1 times higher in total and 2.6 times higher three months after vaccination).  ""The study demonstrates that Sputnik V neutralizes the Omicron variant by inducing robust antibody response associated with high levels of protection,"" reads the report.  ""The hard scientific data proves Sputnik V has higher virus-neutralizing activity against Omicron as compared to other vaccines and will play a major role in the global fight against this new contagious variant,"" said Alexander Gintsburg, Director, GamaleyaNational Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia.    The joint study claims that Sputnik V develops a wider pool of antibodies to different epitopes in contrast to Pfizer vaccine, which utilizes the spike protein in a proline-stabilized form directed mainly to the specific epitopes, which were highly affected by the mutations in the Omicron variant.  It also claims that Sputnik Light is a universal booster to other vaccines ""thanks to the optimal configuration of Sputnik vaccine's adenoviral platform which provides better protection against Omicron and other mutations as demonstrated in multiple studies.""  ""A 'mix & match' trial of a combination of Sputnik Light with vaccines produced by AstraZeneca, Sinopharm, Moderna and Cansino, conducted in 5 provinces in Argentina has demonstrated that Sputnik Light induces stronger antibody and T-cell response as compared to homologous regimen (two shots of the same vaccine),"" researcher claims.   ""Each 'vaccine cocktail' combination with Sputnik Light provided a higher antibody titer on the 14th day after administering a second dose when compared to original homogenous (same vaccine as first and second dose) regimens of each of the vaccines,"" they added.  The study was conducted by the Gamaleya National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology (Gamaleya Center) and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF, Russia's sovereign wealth fund, investor in Sputnik V and Sputnik Light coronavirus vaccines) at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani (Italy) by a joint team of researchers of the Institute and the Gamaleya Center.

4,25.12.2021,Laos becomes 20th country to authorise one-shot Sputnik Light vaccine,"Laos becomes 20th country to authorise one-shot Sputnik Light vaccine Asia News Network (ANN) is the leading regional alliance of news titles striving to bring the region closer, through an active sharing of editorial content on happenings in the region.VIENTIANE (Vientiane Times/ANN) — The Russian single-shot Sputnik Light vaccine against the coronavirus has been approved for use in Laos, the developer and backer of the jab have announced.  The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Russia’s sovereign wealth fund) which markets the vaccine globally, announced on Tuesday that Laos was the 20th country to authorise Sputnik Light, the first component of the Sputnik V two-shot vaccine.   “Sputnik Light vaccine is based on human adenovirus serotype 26, which is the first component of the Sputnik V vaccine. In March 2021 the two-dose Sputnik V was also authorised in Laos. Both Sputnik Light and Sputnik V vaccines have been approved under the emergency use authorisation procedure,” RDIF stated. “One-shot Sputnik Light is a highly effective vaccine when used both on standalone basis and applied as a booster.  The latest findings by the Gamaleya Center based on data from 28,000 subjects in Moscow have demonstrated Sputnik Light vaccine administered standalone has 70 percent efficacy against infection from the Delta variant of coronavirus during the first three months after vaccination. The vaccine is 75 percent effective among subjects under the age of 60,” it added.  According to the RDIF, the efficacy of the one-shot Sputnik Light as a booster against the Delta variant for other vaccines will be close to the efficacy of the Sputnik V vaccine against the Delta variant – more than 83 percent against infection and more than 94 percent against hospitalisation. A one-shot vaccination regimen of Sputnik Light has a number of advantages, including ease of administering the vaccine, monitoring, and more flexible re-vaccination schedule when used as a booster.  Sputnik Light has demonstrated a superior efficacy compared with some two-shot vaccines, which have shown a major decline in efficacy against the Delta variant to less than 50 percent five months after injection. Standalone use of Sputnik Light also provides much higher efficacy against severe disease and hospitalisations.  Sputnik Light has been proven to be safe and highly effective by real-world vaccination data. In particular, the vaccine has demonstrated efficacy of between 78.6 percent and 83.7 percent among the elderly, as confirmed by the Ministry of Health of Argentina. Paraguay’s Ministry of Health also found Sputnik Light to be 93.5 percent effective during the country’s ongoing vaccination campaign.  The Sputnik V vaccine, developed by the Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, was registered by the Ministry of Health of Russia and became the world’s first registered vaccine against the Coronavirus. Sputnik Light is the first component – recombinant human adenovirus serotype number 26 (rAd26) – of Sputnik V.  RDIF is working with partners and manufacturers around the world to ramp up the production of Sputnik vaccines, which can be stored at a temperature of +2 to +8 degrees Celsius, allowing for easy distribution worldwide.",https://asianews.network/laos-becomes-20th-country-to-authorise-one-shot-sputnik-light-vaccine/,https://sputnikvaccine.com/local/templates/sputnik/img/logo_inner_new.svg,Sputnikvaccine
5,25.11.2021,Sputnik V shows 80 long-term efficacy against COVID in San Marino from 6th through 8th month after administering the second dose,"(This story has not been edited by THE WEEK and is auto-generated from a PTI(Eds: Disclaimer: The following press release comes to you under an arrangement with PRNewswire. PTI takes no editorial responsibility for the same.)   MOSCOW, Nov. 24, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF, Russia's sovereign wealth fund) announces the real-world data of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of San Marino on the Russian Sputnik V vaccine demonstrating it is 80% effective against coronavirus infection from 6th to 8th months after administering the second dose.    Efficacy of Sputnik V on 6-8 months is much higher than officially published efficacy of mRNA vaccines. Sputnik team believes that adenoviral vaccines provide for longer efficacy than mRNA vaccines due to longer antibody and T-cell response.    The data is based on the number of COVID infections in San Marino in November 2021. Efficacy was calculated based on data obtained from over 18,600 individuals fully vaccinated with Sputnik V not less than 5 months before November.    The hospitalization rate with COVID infection following vaccination with Sputnik V in San Marino was only 0.75 per 1,000 people during the entire mass vaccination in the country from February to November 2021. This rate is more than 2 times lower than that of any other vaccine used in the country.    Over 70% of the adult population of San Marino have been vaccinated with Sputnik V.    An article published in EClinicalMedicine (an open access clinical journal published by The Lancet, one of the world's most respected medical journals) in July demonstrated that the Russian vaccine has a high safety profile in San Marino. In particular, Sputnik V shows high tolerability profile in ≥60 age group with nearly all reported adverse events following immunization being mild or moderate and lasting less than 2 days.    Sputnik V pioneered the heterogeneous boosting approach (a ""vaccine cocktail"" using human adenovirus serotype 26 as the first component and human adenovirus serotype 5 as the second component). This approach was proven to be successful in creating a longer and more durable immunity against coronavirus. Sputnik team offered its booster shot (one-shot Sputnik Light vaccine) to other vaccines to lengthen and strengthen their immune response and took the lead in initiating partnerships around the world to conduct joint studies on the combination of Sputnik Light with vaccines of other producers.

Read more at straitstimes.com.MOSCOW (AFP) - The backers of Sputnik V on Wednesday (Nov 24) said the Russian vaccine provides longer immunity against coronavirus than Western jabs using messenger RNA (mRNA) technology.  The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which supported the vaccine's development, said the Sputnik vaccine is 80 per cent effective against coronavirus between six and eight months after the second dose.  The country has recorded more than 9.4 million coronavirus cases, the fifth-highest number in the world, and more than 267,000 virus-related deaths, according to government figures.  ""Sputnik V efficacy is significantly higher than for Pfizer after six to eight months,"" RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev told reporters.  No independent study has confirmed the claim.  The fund said its data was based on the number of coronavirus infections in San Marino in November.  More than 70 per cent of the adult population in San Marino, a tiny republic surrounded by Italy, have been vaccinated with Sputnik.  ""Efficacy was calculated based on data obtained from over 18,600 individuals fully vaccinated with Sputnik V not less than five months before November,"" the RDIF said.  The Sputnik team attributed the success of its vaccine to a ""longer antibody and T-cell response"", referring to the blood components that form part of the human immune system.  Dmitriev said the long-term effectiveness of vaccines was ""the key to solve the pandemic"".  Denis Logunov, deputy director at the state-run Gamaleya Center that developed Sputnik, said the health ministry was to register the vaccine for adolescents aged 12-17.  Independent experts have accused the authorities of downplaying the severity of the epidemic.  President Vladimir Putin earlier on Wednesday made a new appeal to sceptical Russians to vaccinate themselves but remained opposed to mandatory vaccinations.  Despite his repeated pleas, only around 37 per cent of Russians are fully vaccinated.

Russia's one-dose Sputnik Light vaccine had a good safety profile and induced strong immune responses especially in people who had already encountered COVID-19, according to the results of phase I and II trials published in The Lancet Regional Health - Europe medical journal.  The vaccine, a single-dose version of the two-dose Sputnik V vaccine unveiled last year, has already entered later phases of studies and is widely used in Russia, but the publication of the early research in a top Western journal is a milestone as Russia moves towards making Sputnik Light its main vaccine for export.  Scientists from the vaccine's developer, the Gamaleya Institute, oversaw 110 volunteers aged 18–59 in St Petersburg, who were inoculated in January 2021, looking at the response of the immune system and the main side effects.  The results analysed virus neutralization against the original variant and showed a slight but statistically significant decrease in the antibody response for the Alpha and Beta strains. Russia's dominant strain is now the Delta variant.  Russia has already said that subsequent research showed Sputnik Light demonstrated 70% effectiveness against the Delta variant three months after injection. read more  ""Sputnik Light might be considered not only for primary vaccination, but also could be useful as an efficient tool for further revaccination or vaccination after previous COVID-19 infection,"" the study said.

13,13.10.2021,Russia says Sputnik Light is 70% effective against Delta variant,"Russia's Sputnik Light vaccine shows 70% effectiveness against the Delta variant of COVID-19 three months after injection and the one-shot product is likely to become the country's main vaccine, Russia's sovereign wealth fund said on Wednesday.MOSCOW, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Russia's Sputnik Light vaccine shows 70% effectiveness against the Delta variant of COVID-19 three months after injection and the one-shot product is likely to become the country's main vaccine, Russia's sovereign wealth fund said on Wednesday.  The findings are part of a Russian push to promote Sputnik Light as an effective standalone vaccine and as a booster that can be combined with non-Russian vaccines.  RDIF, the wealth fund which markets Sputnik Light abroad, cited data submitted by the developer, the Gamaleya Institute, to medical website medRxiv ahead of a peer review. The data was based on 28,000 participants who received a dose of Sputnik Light, and an unvaccinated control group of 5.6 million.  Russia is battling soaring infections and hesitancy about vaccines at home, while struggling to compete in some markets with Western vaccines developed by Pfizer (PFE.N), Moderna (MRNA.O) and AstraZeneca (AZN.L).  Countries around the world are deploying or considering administering third doses of Pfizer or Moderna as booster shots though there is no scientific consensus about how broadly they should be used.  When used as a booster for other vaccines, Sputnik Light,which comprises the first shot of Russia's two-shot flagship Sputnik V, will be over 83% effective against infection by the Delta variant and over 94% effective against hospitalisation, RDIF said in a statement.  Kirill Dmitriev, head of the RDIF, told Reuters he expected Sputnik Light to become Russia's main COVID-19 vaccine.  ""Eventually, we believe that Sputnik Light could be the main vaccine one year from now when many people will just need to get revaccinated or will have had COVID and won't need Sputnik V,"" he said.  RDIF expects to produce enough Sputnik V and Sputnik Light for 700 million people this year, with around 50% of production already located abroad, Dmitriev said.  He said Russia wanted no more than 20-25% of the global market and had no ambition to take a monopoly position.  Argentina and some other counties were doing trials to combine Sputnik Light with AstraZeneca, Sinopharm and Moderna. Two countries were combining Pfizer and Sputnik Light, he said.  Alexander Gintsburg, director of the Gamaleya Institute, said Sputnik Light was easy and fast to produce.  Manufacturers have told Reuters that they have had difficulties producing the second Sputnik V dose. read more  RDIF had hoped to clinch regulatory approval for Sputnik V from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) months ago, but it has taken longer than expected, depriving it of access to more markets.  Dmitriev said RDIF expected the WHO to approve Sputnik V for use by the end of the year. The WHO said on Wednesday approval for Sputnik V was on hold pending some missing data and legal procedures, which it hoped would be ""sorted out quite soon"".  Dmitriev said it was possible the EMA would grant approval by the end of this year as well. RDIF had got positive feedback from the EU on clinical trials and expected an EU inspection in the autumn, he said.  RDIF had applied for separate approval for the two components used in Sputnik V, and Sputnik Light would therefore be automatically approved at the same time, he added.  Dmitriev said Sputnik Light had already been registered in 15 countries and he expected it to be approved in 30 other countries in the next month.

RDIF has organized the technology transfer for production of the vaccine in the Republic of Uzbekistan. Validation batches have been shipped to the Gamaleya Center for quality control. Commercial production of Sputnik V is subject to successful quality control of the validation batches.  The vaccine produced in Uzbekistan will be used in the national vaccination program. Sputnik V was certified in the country in February 2021.  To date, the Sputnik V vaccine has been registered in 69 countries globally with a total population of over 3.7 bn people. The data obtained by regulators of a number of countries during the vaccination of the population, including in Argentina, Serbia, Bahrain, Hungary, Mexico, San Marino, UAE and others, demonstrates that Sputnik V is one of the safest and most effective vaccines against coronavirus.  Sputnik V is based on a proven and well-studied platform of human adenoviral vectors and uses two different vectors for the two shots in a course of vaccination, providing immunity with a longer duration than vaccines using the same delivery mechanism for both shots.  “Sputnik V is successfully used in Uzbekistan to fight coronavirus. The vaccine has proven highly effective and safe in many countries around the world. Local production of Sputnik V in Uzbekistan will help speed up the vaccination of the population providing for strong and durable immunity, including against new variants of COVID.”  “We are very pleased that our facility was selected as a partner site for the production of the Sputnik V vaccine as a result of the assessment audit thus providing us with an opportunity to contribute to the fight against the pandemic.

REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian  BUENOS AIRES/MOSCOW, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Argentina, racing to fight stop the spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19, said on Thursday it will offer second doses of Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines to citizens who received a first dose of Russia's Sputnik V but could not receive a second jab due to delays in deliveries.  In Buenos Aires province alone, 180,000 Argentines are now beyond the mandated three months period between the first and second dose of Sputnik V but the government is still waiting for further stock of the unique second jab to arrive.  Health minister Carla Vizzotti told a news conference that ""flexibilizing"" the kind of vaccines administered would bolster Argentines' chances against the more contagious Delta variant. First identified in the Latin American country in June, it has so far been detected in 89 cases.  ""We are able to begin interchanging different vaccines starting, while we investigate further, with Sputnik V with Moderna (GMODE.UL) and AstraZeneca (AZN.L),"" Vizzotti said.  ""As evidence published in the United Kingdom suggests, the combination of the AstraZeneca vaccine with the Moderna vaccine is another possibility to be able to flexibilize and accelerate the administration of second doses.""  Argentina was one of the first countries to widely use Russia's Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine and acted as liaison between the Russian authorities and health authorities in Mexico and Bolivia who signed deals to buy it too.  Last month, Argentina made public a letter it sent to the Russian state entity RDIF which is marketing Sputnik V, saying the country urgently needed second doses and threatening to pull the plug on the entire deal if they were not delivered.  ""We understand the shortage and the production difficulties of a few months ago,"" read the letter, signed by an Argentine presidency official. ""But now, seven months later, we are still far behind, as we are starting to receive doses from other providers on a regular basis, with schedules that are met.""  On Thursday, RDIF's Chief executive Kirill Dmitriev told Reuters that any delays will be ironed out by August and that countries combining Sputnik V with another drug had been the plan all along.  ""We suggested it, we always wanted to do a combo,"" he said. ""Sputnik is the first combined vaccine, the first mix and match, which consists of two different shots. We have said from the beginning that two different shots work better than two identical ones.""  On Thursday, more than 1.5 million doses of Moderna began being rolled out as second jabs around the country, with people over 50 prioritized. Administration of second doses of the AstraZeneca or Moderna vaccines to those who received a first dose of Sputnik in Buenos Aires will begin on Friday.  Moderna's vaccine, like Pfizer-BioNTech's, is based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, while Sputnik V uses a non-replicative viral vector.  The decision was taken to issue a combination of doses after preliminary results of a trial by Argentine scientists showed it was safe and offered similar immunity, the government said in a statement.  On Wednesday, RDIF said in a statement that delays in international deliveries of the second dose will be fully resolved this month.  On Tuesday, Argentina's Richmond Laboratories said in a joint statement issued with RDIF that it would produce more than 3 million doses of the second component of the Sputnik V vaccine in August.

The Pune-based vaccine-maker will produce 300 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine, annually.  The first batch of Sputnik V is expected from SII in September, said Kirill Dmitriev, RDIF Chief Executive. September, he said, will be a key month for the scale up of Sputnik in India, as the other manufacturing tie-ups would also begin to deliver by then.  The RDIF Chief’s statement comes even as reports in India suggest a shortfall in the supply of the second dose of Sputnik V. While the RDIF head did not address the issue, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories clarified late on Monday: “Neither the ongoing soft commercial launch nor work towards its ramp up in India have been put on hold.” DRL inked the first deal with the Russian sovereign wealth fund, last year, to market the vaccine in India.  Also read: Dr Reddy’s to strengthen commercial roll-out of Sputnik V  Dmitriev said the SII alliance would serve India’s vaccine requirement first, and then take up exports, to the 66 countries where Sputnik V is approved. Talks are on with the Indian authorities to facilitate exports, he said. There was, however, little clarity on the percentage of the doses that would be supplied to India, or the pathway for RDIF’s single-dose Sputnik Light.  Sputnik V pioneered the use of heterogeneous boosting in Covid-19 vaccines, he said, with two different vectors for the two-shot vaccine. This approach leads to longer immunity.  With many countries exploring a “mix and match” of vaccines, he said, they too were open to combining Sputnik and Covishield. In fact, results from the use of Sputnik and the AstraZeneca vaccine would be out by this month end, he said.  As part of the technical-transfer process, SII has received cell and vector samples from Russia’s Gamaleya Center. With their import approved by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), the cultivation process has begun, he said. The RDIF chief said, “This will substantially increase our production capabilities.”  Reiterating the timeline, SII Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla said, “We hope to make millions of doses in the coming months with trial batches starting in September.”  Serum Institute has a manufacturing and marketing tie-up for the AstraZeneca-Oxford University Covid-19 vaccine (Covishield), besides alliances with Novavax and Codagenix.",https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/russias-rdif-indias-sii-to-produce-sputnik-vaccine-in-india/article35295551.ece,https://sputnikvaccine.com/local/templates/sputnik/img/logo_inner_new.svg,Sputnikvaccine

The company said, vaccination with Sputnik V has produced protective neutralizing titers against new variants, including Alpha B.1.1.7 (first identified in the UK), Beta B.1.351 (first identified in South Africa), Gamma P.1 (first identified in Brazil), Delta B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3 (first identified in India) and Moscow endemic variants B.1.1.141 and B.1.1.317 with mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD).  ""The methodology was based on the assessment of virus-neutralizing activity (VNA) using the live virus, which provides the most reliable data and is the gold standard. It compared neutralizing activity of Sputnik V induced sera to the internationally relevant variants with the neutralizing activity to the ancestral B.1.1.1 variant. The sera were obtained from individuals after vaccination with two doses of Sputnik V,"" the company said.  The study methodology was described in the research paper published in a leading international journal on July 12, 2021.  ""Sputnik V pioneered the vaccine cocktail approach with two shots. The tests conducted by the Gamaleya Center have demonstrated the validity of this approach as the virus-neutralizing activity against new strains, which are more dangerous and infectious, remains higher than that of many other vaccines. RDIF will continue supporting further studies of the efficacy of Sputnik V against new strains while also analyzing opportunities to partner with other leading vaccine producers for developing vaccine cocktails using the first shot of Sputnik V,"" said Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the RDIF.  Virus neutralizing activity assay is not directly related to the effectiveness of a vaccine.  ""The data confirms that Sputnik V remains protective against newly detected variants. Notably, Sputnik V demonstrated significantly less of a reduction in its virus-neutralizing activity against a number of variants compared to data from other vaccine producers, which had earlier confirmed the efficacy of their vaccines against new variants of coronavirus,"" as per the company.  The Gamaleya Center and RDIF are also studying new opportunities to develop vaccine cocktails jointly with other leading COVID vaccine producers using the first component of Sputnik V.  ""Our studies have demonstrated strong results of Sputnik V against new variants of SARS-CoV-2. We receive more evidence of the ability of coronavirus to transform and mutate across the globe.

The first batch will be shipped to the Gamaleya Center for quality control. RDIF and Morepen Laboratories signed a cooperation agreement in June 2021 and are actively implementing the technology transfer.  Sputnik V was granted an emergency use authorization in India on April 12, 2021. India is the leading production hub for Sputnik V. RDIF had reached agreements earlier with other leading pharmaceutical companies in India -- Gland Pharma, Hetero Biopharma, Panacea Biotec, Stelis Biopharma and Virchow Biotech. In total, agreements with partners in India provide for production of more than 850 million doses of Sputnik V per year.  To date, Sputnik V has been registered in 67 countries globally with a total population of over 3.5 billion people. The data obtained by regulators of a number of countries during the vaccination of the population, including Argentina, Serbia, Bahrain, Hungary, Mexico and others, demonstrates that Sputnik V is one of the safest and most effective vaccines against coronavirus.  Sputnik V is based on a proven and well-studied platform of human adenoviral vectors and uses two different vectors for the two shots in a course of vaccination, providing immunity with a longer duration than vaccines using the same delivery mechanism for both shots.  “As the pandemic is yet far from over and new, more dangerous variants of coronavirus are being detected in various regions of the world, RDIF is increasing capacities for production of Sputnik V in India, one of the key hubs. Agreement with Morepen Laboratories provides for larger amount of Sputnik V to be available both for India and our partners globally to speed up the vaccination with one of the best vaccines in the world,"" Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund said.  Morepen’s API facilities at Masulkhana and Baddi are approved by the US FDA and other regulatory bodies of Europe, Asia, and Australia. The company’s state-of-the-art manufacturing facility at Baddi comprises a scientifically integrated complex of 10 plants, each with a specific product profile exporting to over 80 countries worldwide.  “The partnership would be our privilege to work jointly on expanding the production base in India. We take this partnership as starting point for long term relationship with RDIF and its partner companies as we look forward for many more areas of common interest. Morepen’s commitment towards this project is step forward towards entry into biosimilars and other biologicals,"" Sushil Suri, chairman & managing director of Morepen Laboratories Limited, said.  The Russian vaccine has already been launched in India under its nationwide covid-19 vaccination program. The efficacy of Sputnik V is 97.6% based on the analysis of data on the coronavirus infection rate among those in Russia vaccinated with both components of Sputnik V from December 5, 2020 to March 31, 2021.  The Sputnik V vaccine is based on the platform of human adenoviral vectors, which cause the common cold and have been around for thousands of years. The storage temperature of Sputnik V at +2+8 C means it can be stored in a conventional refrigerator without any need to invest in additional cold-chain infrastructure.",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/rdif-morepen-laboratories-make-test-batch-of-sputnik-v-in-india-11625560029643.html,https://sputnikvaccine.com/local/templates/sputnik/img/logo_inner_new.svg,Sputnikvaccine

Anvisa also voted to approve, again with conditions, the Covaxin shot made by Bharat Biotech, a private company based in the Indian city of Hyderabad.

The rulings come after the health regulator rejected in late April imports of the Sputnik V shot requested by state governors desperate for vaccines. States had originally wanted 37 million doses.  At the time, Anvisa's five-member board voted unanimously not to approve the Russian vaccine after technical staff had highlighted ""inherent risks"" and ""serious"" defects, citing a lack of data guaranteeing its safety, quality and effectiveness.  The rejection kicked off a testy exchange with the Russian developers, who threatened to sue the Brazilian agency for defamation, accusing them of buckling under US pressure.

55,14.05.2021,Russia's Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine rollout begins in India,"NEW DELHI: India on Friday (May 14) started deploying Russia's Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine, the first foreign-made shot to be used in the country as it reels from an explosion in cases and deaths.Sputnik in mid-April became the third vaccine to be approved by New Delhi along with the AstraZeneca shotNEW DELHI: India on Friday (May 14) started deploying Russia's Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine, the first foreign-made shot to be used in the country as it reels from an explosion in cases and deaths.  Sputnik in mid-April became the third vaccine to be approved by New Delhi along with the AstraZeneca shot - made in India - and the homegrown Covaxin of Bharat Biotech.  The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which helped finance the jab, said vaccination started in the southern city of Hyderabad on Friday, making Sputnik V the ""first foreign-made vaccine that is used in India"".  ""RDIF stands ready to support our partners in India to launch a full-scale vaccination with Sputnik V as soon as possible,"" the fund's CEO Kirill Dmitriev said in a statement.  The first token batch of Sputnik vaccines - reportedly 150,000 of them - arrived on May 1 and a second delivery is expected in the next few days.  But a number of leading India-based drugmakers, including Virchow Biotech and Hetero Biopharma, have agreements for local production of Sputnik V with the aim to produce over 850 million doses of the jab a year.  In recent days India has been adding roughly as many new COVID-19 cases as the rest of the world put together.  More than 260,000 Indians have died, according to official figures. Experts believe the true death toll could be more than a million.  The pandemic has eased slightly in recent days in major cities in New Delhi but appears now to be raging in India's vast rural hinterland where two-thirds of people live.  Health care facilities are poor in rural areas and many locals rely on unqualified amateur doctors who are misdiagnosing COVID-19 patients.  More than 100 bodies have washed up on the banks of the Ganges in northern India in recent days while dozens of shallow graves have been found by the river.  India began vaccinating its huge population of 1.3 billion people in early 2021 but it has faltered.  So far it has administered about 180 million jabs but only around 40 million people are fully vaccinated - around three percent of the population.  On May 1 it expanded the programme to cover all adults. Previously only those over 45 or certain groups like health care workers could get a jab.  But because of dire shortages and confusion over prices, many Indian states have been unable to meet demand.  Technical problems have meant that those under 44 have struggled to make appointments on government apps.  Those without smart phones - who make up a large chunk of the population - have largely been excluded altogether.  READ: India's most populous state Uttar Pradesh to spend up to US$1 billion to buy COVID-19 vaccines    India is known as the ""pharmacy of the world"" and is home to the Serum Institute, the largest vaccine maker in the world by volume.  Until cases exploded, India was exporting millions of doses of the AstraZeneca jab to dozens of countries, including under the Covax initiative for poorer countries.  But Serum as well as Bharat Biotech have struggled to meet demand and they and the government are scrambling to hike production.  Serum is making 60 million to 70 million AstraZeneca doses per month, and is aiming for 100 million by July. Bharat is aiming to produce 10 million a month and targets 60 million to 70 million.  Besides Sputnik, Indian firms have agreements to make other vaccines including that of Johnson & Johnson, but it could be months until these are deployed.  According to the RDIF, Russia's vaccine, which is named after the Soviet-era satellite, has been registered in 65 countries.  It has not yet been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or the United States' Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Some Western countries have been wary of Sputnik V over concerns the Kremlin would use it as a soft-power tool to advance its interests.  Moscow registered the jab in August before large-scale clinical trials, but leading medical journal The Lancet has since said it is safe and more than 90 per cent effective.

A Phase III clinical trial involving 7,000 people was under way in Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Ghana and other countries, the RDIF said. Interim results are expected later this month.  According to authorities, around 8 million Russians have so far been fully inoculated with the flagship two-dose Sputnik V, named after the Soviet-era satellite that triggered the space race in a nod to the project's geopolitical importance for Moscow.  Russian scientists last month said Sputnik V was 97.6% effective against COVID-19 in a ""real-world"" assessment based on data from 3.8 million people.  The slower pace of vaccination in Russia compared to other countries with domestically produced vaccines has provoked questions over its export intentions from some European officials. The European Medicines Agency has not yet approved the shot and Austria on Tuesday said it would only buy Sputnik V after EMA approval. read more  ""The single-dose regimen solves the challenge of immunizing large groups in a shorter time, which is especially important during the acute phase of the spread of coronavirus, achieving herd immunity faster,"" said RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev.

59,30.04.2021,RDIF: Turkey becomes 63rd country in the world to authorize Sputnik V,"The vaccine has been registered in Turkey under the emergency use authorization procedure (EUA).MOSCOW — The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF — Russia's sovereign wealth fund) announced that the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Turkey has registered the Russian Sputnik V vaccine against coronavirus in the country.    The vaccine has been registered in Turkey under the emergency use authorization procedure (EUA). Turkey has become the 63rd country to authorize the use of Sputnik V. Total population of the countries where Sputnik V is approved for use exceeds 3.2 billion people.    Post-vaccination studies in a number of countries demonstrate that Sputnik V is the safest and most effective vaccine against coronavirus. Sputnik V ranks second among coronavirus vaccines globally in terms of the number of approvals issued by government regulators.    RDIF had earlier reached an agreement with Turkey's Viscoran İlaç pharmaceutical company to cooperate on production of Sputnik V in the country. Viscoran İlaç has carried out necessary studies for localization of the product and aims to launch the production in the country in the upcoming months at several facilities.    To date Sputnik V has also been approved in Russia, Belarus, Argentina, Bolivia, Serbia, Algeria, Palestine, Venezuela, Paraguay, Turkmenistan, Hungary, UAE, Iran, Republic of Guinea, Tunisia, Armenia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Republika Srpska (entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina), Lebanon, Myanmar, Pakistan, Mongolia, Bahrain, Montenegro, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.    It has been approved in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Gabon, San-Marino, Ghana, Syria, Kyrgyzstan, Guyana, Egypt, Honduras, Guatemala, Moldova, Slovakia, Angola, Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Sri Lanka, Laos, Iraq, North Macedonia, Kenya, Morocco, Jordan, Namibia, Azerbaijan, Philippines, Cameroon, Seychelles, Mauritius, Vietnam, Antigua and Barbuda, Mali, Panama, India, Nepal and Bangladesh.    Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the RDIF, said: ""Russia and Turkey have been actively cooperating in the joint fight against coronavirus since the beginning of the pandemic and RDIF welcomes the decision by the Ministry of Health of Turkey today to authorize Sputnik V.    “The vaccine is used in dozens of countries around the world and post-vaccination studies in many of them demonstrate that Sputnik V is the safest and most effective vaccine against coronavirus.    “The Russian vaccine will contribute to saving lives, preventing the spread of coronavirus and creating a long-term immunity among the population in Turkey and will help to return to normal life soon.""    Sputnik V has a number of key advantages: • Efficacy of Sputnik V is 97.6% based on the analysis of data on the coronavirus infection rate among those in Russia vaccinated with both components of Sputnik V from Dec. 5, 2020 to March 31, 2021. • The Sputnik V vaccine is based on a proven and well-studied platform of human adenoviral vectors, which cause the common cold and have been around for thousands of years. • Sputnik V uses two different vectors for the two shots in a course of vaccination, providing immunity with a longer duration than vaccines using the same delivery mechanism for both shots. • The safety, efficacy and lack of negative long-term effects of adenoviral vaccines have been proven by more than 250 clinical studies over two decades. • There are no strong allergies caused by Sputnik V. • The storage temperature of Sputnik V at +2+8 C means it can be stored in a conventional refrigerator without any need to invest in additional cold-chain infrastructure. • The price of Sputnik V is less than $10 per shot, making it affordable around the world. — PRNewswire",https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/606222,https://sputnikvaccine.com/local/templates/sputnik/img/logo_inner_new.svg,Sputnikvaccine

The country is in desperate need of Covid-19 vaccine doses to ensure the continuation of the nationwide inoculation drive.  The decision to approve Sputnik V was announced by DGDA Director General Major General Md Mahbubur Rahman on Tuesday, who said that the import, production and use of the Russian vaccine has been green-lit in the country.  ""We are expecting around four million vaccine doses to arrive in May,"" he added.  He further said that only a handful of pharmaceutical companies in Bangladesh have the facilities necessary to manufacture vaccines, which will be evaluated by Russian representatives.

Avifavir, developed by Russia's ChemrRar Group, was the first Favipiravir-based drug in the world to be approved for the treatment of the coronavirus, and it was also Russia's first registered drug against the coronavirus, RDIF recalled.  ""RDIF ... and ChemRar Group announce that Russian anti-COVID Favipiravir-based drug Avifavir has been registered by the National Agency of Drug and food Control of Indonesia ...

The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which promotes the vaccine, said in a statement on the Sputnik V website that it had now been approved for use in 56 countries with a combined population of over 1.5 billion people.  “Its approval in Vietnam, one of the most populated countries in Southeast Asia, will provide for protecting the people and getting closer to lifting the restrictions imposed because of coronavirus,” RDIF CEO Kirill Dmitriev said.  Vietnam, with a population of 98 million, has been relying on the AstraZeneca vaccine so far and since launching vaccinations on March 8 more than 36,000 people have been inoculated.  The country is also in talks to buy vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson and is aiming to put its first domestically developed COVID-19 vaccine in use in 2022.  The government has previously said it would acquire 150 million vaccine doses in total, both through direct purchases from producers and the COVAX vaccine-sharing scheme.

A new wave of cases in the Philippines, which has the second highest number of COVID-19 infections and deaths in Southeast Asia, is threatening hopes of a strong economic rebound after a record contraction last year and the loss of millions of jobs.  The health ministry said there were now 648,066 confirmed coronavirus cases and 12,900 deaths, including 13 more fatalities on Friday.  ""The ministry continues to appeal for us to stay home and avoid going out if not necessary,"" it said. The previous record was 6,958 cases on Aug. 10.  The latest outbreak is again concentrated on the congested Manila region, and includes the more transmissible variants.  The coronavirus task force on Friday reduced the number allowed at religious gatherings and conferences to 30% of capacity from the previous 50% until April 4.  It also ordered cinemas, driving schools, libraries, museums and cockfighting arenas to close.  The Philippines' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday approved the Sputnik V vaccine developed by Russia's Gamaleya Institute.  The first deliveries of Sputnik V from Russia are expected in April, the head of Russia's RDIF sovereign wealth fund, which markets the shot abroad, told Reuters.  ""We have great demand for Sputnik vaccines from 52 nations where we are registered but we will prioritise the Philippines and deliver the first volumes in April,"" RDIF CEO Kirill Dmitriev said.  Sputnik V is the fourth shot to get emergency use authorisation after vaccines from Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Sinovac.

""The known and potential benefits of the Gamaleya Sputnik V vaccine... outweigh the known and potential risks,"" FDA chief Rolando Enrique Domingo said, adding that interim data showed the vaccine had an efficacy of 91.6% in age groups 18 and older.

Hungary became the first EU country to grant the Russian vaccine emergency national approval in January, Slovakia has ordered shipments, and Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis has said his country could move to use Sputnik V.  The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said in a statement it would review data from ongoing trials of the vaccine until there was enough evidence for a formal marketing authorisation application. (bit.ly/3uQxwfL)  EMA’s ‘rolling reviews’ are aimed at speeding up the approval process by allowing researchers to submit findings in real-time before final trial data is ready.  “While EMA cannot predict the overall timelines, it should take less time than normal to evaluate an eventual application because of the work done during the rolling review,” it said.  Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the RDIF sovereign wealth fund that is promoting Sputnik V internationally, hailed the start of EMA’s rolling review as an important moment for Russia which he said showed its application had been a strong one.  “Sputnik V can act as a bridge between Russia and Europe, but its roll out should not get bogged down in politics,” Dmitriev told Reuters, praising Germany, France, Italy and Austria for what he called their pragmatic approach to Sputnik V.  The shot’s efficacy was initially greeted with scepticism by some Western scientists after Russia approved it in August last year without waiting for the results of full clinical trials.  However, scientists said it was almost 92% effective in fighting COVID-19, based on peer-reviewed late-stage trial results published in The Lancet medical journal last month.  The two-shot vaccine uses two different weakened common cold viruses to deliver immune-building protein to the human body.  Dmitriev said Moscow could provide vaccines for 50 million Europeans starting from June if the shot won EU-wide approval, adding he expected several EU countries to approve the use of Sputnik V this month for their national use.  He did not name the countries.  The European Commission said on Thursday there were no talks under way to buy Sputnik V for the portfolio of COVID-19 shots ordered by the EU.  Europe has so far approved vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca/Oxford, while ongoing reviews for CureVac and Novavax’s candidates are underway.  The EMA is expected to give its verdict on J&J’s single-shot vaccine on March 11.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-europe-vaccines-idUSKCN2AW0W8,https://sputnikvaccine.com/local/templates/sputnik/img/logo_inner_new.svg,Sputnikvaccine
