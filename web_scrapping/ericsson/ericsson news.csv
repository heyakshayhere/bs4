Today, Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) released a new Connected Truck Transport report in partnership with ZF, Orange Belgium, and Arthur D. Little. The report analyzes the power of IoT connectivity to mitigate the complexities brought on by disruptions in the logistics supply chain, including soaring fuel prices, driver shortages, and governmental regulations.
A competitive landscape, elevated customer expectations, and environmental pressures are just some of the challenges facing the transport and logistics industry. As older trucks are retrofitted and new trucks equipped with fleet telematics — a technology enabled by cellular IoT connectivity, giving fleet managers and drivers access to data from an array of onboard sensors – the potential for connected trucks is indisputable. Cellular IoT connections continue to grow exponentially, however, their full capabilities are just scratching the surface. In the transport industry alone, IoT connections are expected to grow from 100 million in 2020 to 292 million in 2030, with connected devices sending more data and augmenting growth beyond the number of connected devices available.
Two use cases developed with ZF’s Transics branded Fleet Management Solutions – an industry leading telematics solution and Orange Belgium are explored in the report that clearly demonstrate the power of IoT-enabled fleet telematics, particularly through truck and trailer monitoring and driver assistance. As we shift the industry into a new gear, the use cases serve as key indicators of the benefits of levering real-time data. In fact, the potential cost savings could be well over 6% for a mid-size truck company’s total cost, with one-third coming from driver assistance and two-thirds from truck and trailer monitoring.
Also highlighted in the report is the “Amazon Effect,” which has pushed supply chains to develop and adopt new business models and standards that match Amazon’s logistics capabilities. This includes incorporating fleet telematics, which not only alleviates challenges but can also support turning data into actionable insights. Fleets that have been impacted by the Amazon Effect can include any type of vehicle from planes to micromobility scooters but are especially impactful for the truck transportation industry.
Hjalmar Van Raemdonck, Head of Digital Solutions with ZF’s Commercial Vehicle Solutions division, says: “We recognize the pressure that many industries are under as they strive to overcome logistics operational challenges, driven by ever more demanding supply chains. Accelerated by the growing requirements and benefits of digitalization, cellular IoT connectivity has become a key enabler for commercial shippers and carriers. Providing real-time operational visibility and supporting asset optimization has an increasingly important role in solving many current and future business challenges.”
Werner de Laet, Chief Enterprise, Innovation & Wholesale Officer of Orange Belgium, says: “We have been supporting ZF’s Transics Fleet Management Solutions since 2004, providing global connectivity to help simplify operations for their end customers who frequently drive trucks across borders. With our eSIMS, global roaming connectivity is readily available, enabling ZF to manage long haul trucks for international deliveries.”
Kyle Okamoto, General Manager IoT, Ericsson, says: “Implementation of fleet telematics enabled by cellular IoT connectivity allows enterprises to deploy, manage and scale their IoT businesses in ways never previously possible, from acquisition through disposal. These industries will see an immediate impact as their businesses transform and economize substantially through IoT connectivity.”

Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) Performance Optimizers is a suite of AI-powered applications, that analyze the CSPs’ Radio Access Network (RAN) to proactively provide mobile network optimization recommendations and resolve specific network performance issues.
Ericsson Performance Optimizers can be deployed to enable a helicopter view of the network as a whole. The solution accounts for the invisible changes in the network caused by each addition to the environment, such as new applications, city growth, new sites or user behavior. It is equipped with digital twin technology and advanced AI techniques like deep reinforcement learning.
Digital twin technology accurately mimics the network behavior upon parameter changes, ensuring an approach that minimizes risk and elevates the optimizer’s quality to telco grade from day one. Reinforcement learning is a machine-learning (ML) technique that learns from the network, where an agent (Performance Optimizer) interacts with the environment and takes actions towards a long-term goal.
Additionally, the solution can also be used to accurately predict network performance improvements and proactively provide one-shot optimization recommendations for targeted cells.
Ericsson plans to periodically add new features to the existing solution to address the challenges brought on by different network issues, thereby increasing the coverage of automated optimization.
With 5G, CSPs are looking to transform essential parts of their operations to achieve optimal performance and return on investment. Vendor agnostic AI-native solutions such as Ericsson Performance Optimizers are key to automate and cope with growing complexity while keeping control of cost. 
In November 2021, Ericsson trialed the solution with Ooredoo Qatar for a major football  tournament. As part of the partnership Ericsson provided network optimization and event management and 5G connectivity in three stadiums, airports and places of attraction. Massive efficiency gains were noted – where traditional worst cell analysis takes days to complete, the new automated approach with performance optimizers took only 15 minutes, producing hundreds of recommendations.
Juan Manuel Melero, Head of Network Design & Optimization, Ericsson, says: During the trial with Ooredoo Qatar, we noted that 89% of internal uplink interference cases were automatically resolved by the Performance Optimizers. This resulted in 7% improvement in uplink capacity, along with significant gains in speed and traffic volume. We now look forward to leveraging our expertise and experience to support our customers around the world to achieve top network performance and deliver the best user experience.
Günther Ottendorfer, Chief Technology and Infrastructure Officer at Ooredoo Qatar, says: For Ooredoo, customer experience and automation are top priority. We see AI-powered operations as key to deliver on our promise of world-class services to our subscribers. During the major football event held in Qatar in December 2021, Ericsson’s Cognitive Software provided a near real-time automation of optimization actions.

Comments from Börje Ekholm, President and CEO of Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC)
We continue to execute on our strategy to be a leading mobile infrastructure provider and to establish a focused enterprise business. We see strong business momentum and our investments in technology and a resilient supply chain have allowed us to continue to win market share and deliver on customer commitments in spite of global supply chain challenges. In the quarter, we saw organic sales[1] growth of 3%. Gross margin at 42.3% (42.8%) indicates underlying stability while absorbing cost increases in the supply chain. Our EBITA margin was 11.0%, adjusted for revaluation of holdings and provision related to Russia. 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting humanitarian disaster is a major setback for the world. While mobile infrastructure is essential for communications in Russia, it has been clear from the start of the invasion that business in Russia would have to be reconsidered. Following current sanctions, we have announced an indefinite suspension of our affected business in Russia and recorded a provision for impairment of assets and other extraordinary costs of SEK -0.9 b. in Q1. We will continue to monitor and respond to the situation day by day, with priority on the safety and well-being of our people. 
In our core mobile infrastructure business, we foresee a longer investment cycle compared with previous mobile generations as 5G’s broad application usage will drive a continued need to increase capacity. Technology leadership is driving our competitiveness, and in the quarter, we invested SEK -10.7 (-9.6) b. in R&D.
Networks sales[1] grew organically by 4% in Q1 reflecting our continually strengthened market position. Gross margin was 44.7% (46.1%). Software sales vary between quarters, and a certain SEK 1 b. annual software contract that is normally recorded in Q1, is this year delayed into Q2. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by proactive investments in supply chain resilience. Hard work throughout the organization enabled us to deliver on customer commitments despite global supply chain challenges. We also continue to increase our R&D investments to extend our leadership. R&D increased by SEK -1 b. YoY and was primarily related to our Cloud RAN portfolio, which gives customers more flexible deployment options, and to next generation ASICs that provide industry-leading radio performance, energy savings and footprint reduction. We foresee long-term attractive return on our investments similar to the last few years.
Digital Services organic sales[1] were down by -2% YoY in the quarter and EBIT was SEK -1.4 b. We are building a strong platform for Digital Services and sales development in the cloud native 5G core portfolio is encouraging with double digit growth, albeit from a low base. However, the overall result in the quarter is not satisfactory. The target of a limited loss for 2022 is challenging especially in light of the increased investments in R&D in service orchestration and 5G portfolio. We now increase focus on accelerating sales growth and addressing efficiency to improve profitability.
To capture opportunities in the rapidly growing enterprise space, we are focusing on two specific areas. The first focus area is wireless networks for enterprise where we already offer easy-to-use pre-packaged solutions, with Cradlepoint showing strong growth in the first quarter as 5G coverage increases on the US C-band. We also see growing momentum for our 5G portfolio in Dedicated Networks. In addition, we are increasing investments in our enterprise go-to-market organization.
The other focus area is a Global Network Platform, which will be built on global unified interfaces, so called APIs. Developers and enterprises will be able to create new use cases and experiences, like high quality video or XR on top of the 5G network, which enable operators and the industry to monetize the network investment in new ways. Ericsson intends to play a major role in building the API platform. With our previously announced intention to acquire Vonage – more than 1 million developers, 120,000 enterprise customers and a proven scaled API infrastructure – we will have a strong position to deliver on this ambition.            
Ericsson’s IPR licensing revenues in Q1 were affected by several expiring patent license agreements pending renewal and by 5G license negotiations. We are confident in our strong 5G position and leading patent portfolio, positioning us well to conclude pending and future license renewals. Revenues from current IPR licensing contracts are estimated to SEK 1.0–1.5 b. in Q2. The actual revenue impact will depend on timing as well as terms and conditions of new agreements.
We are currently engaging with the Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding the breach notices it issued relating to the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The resolution of these matters could result in a range of actions by DOJ, and may likely include additional monetary payments, the magnitude of which cannot at this time be reliably estimated. As this process is ongoing, we remain limited in what we can say about the historical events covered in the Iraq investigation and our ongoing engagement on the matter. We are fully committed to co-operating with the DOJ and our work to further strengthen our Ethics and Compliance program, controls and our culture remains a top priority. It was actually our improved compliance program that allowed us to identify the misconduct in Iraq that started at least back in 2011.
In light of the global supply chain challenges, we decided to create a buffer of vital components in order to secure that we meet customer delivery commitments. In the quarter this had a material impact on inventory levels and therefore Free cash flow before M&A amounted to -1.7 (+1.6) b. We expect elevated inventory levels to remain in the next few quarters.
We are well positioned to continue our strategic journey. The mobile infrastructure business will remain our core and we will not spare any effort to strengthen our position here. Our ambition is to continue to grow and develop this business based on market growth and market share gains. In the growing enterprise space, we are seeing good traction for our established portfolio with Cradlepoint and Dedicated Networks. We continue to work towards closing the Vonage acquisition in the first half of 2022 and to start developing the Global Network Platform. 
With our investments in both our core and enterprise businesses, as well as in our culture, we are determined to continue to make Ericsson a stronger, more resilient company while at the same time put it on a higher growth trajectory. Our key focus is to accelerate the pace towards reaching our long-term target of an EBITA margin of 15–18% and our ambition is to reach this target no later than in 2–3 years.

Ericsson Routes is like a Waze for wireless cellular connectivity, providing connectivity predictions so that users can be sure they will have a consistent and reliable connection throughout the whole journey and when planning routes for autonomous vehicles. Ericsson Routes is an incubation unit within Ericsson to broaden services to the automotive industry.
Hillwood, one of the leading industrial and commercial real estate developers in the U.S., and Ericsson, a global leader in telecommunications and technology partner to automakers, have a shared vision of a future where connected mobility will make transportation safer and more sustainable.
The AllianceTexas Mobility Innovation Zone (MIZ) is an unparalleled ecosystem that allows mobility visionaries full access to essential resources and partnerships to test, scale and commercialize the latest technologies. In the less than three years since the launch of the MIZ, it has quickly become one of the premier global destinations for pioneers advancing next-generation supply chain technologies, including Wing, Bell, TuSimple, Gatik, and many more. 
“Partnering with Ericsson Routes and their technology leadership gives our customers world-class and cutting-edge services that will advance the mobility industry,” says Russell Laughlin, Executive Vice President of Hillwood. “This unique technology offers mobility leaders an opportunity to be at the forefront of ensuring their products have the connectivity they need to operate now and well into the future.”
“Ericsson believes that wireless cellular connectivity is essential to mobility. Companies need to know and trust that connectivity will be seamless before sending an autonomous vehicle onto the road to deliver groceries or a drone to inspect a power line. Ericsson Routes provides this insurance, and we’re excited to see it grow at the AllianceTexas Mobility Innovation Zone,” says Daniel Alexus, Head of Ericsson ONE.
Earlier this year, Ericsson Routes launched in San Francisco, Calif., providing a single integration point and a consistent prediction engine for autonomous vehicles across all their wireless service providers. The service predicts secure connectivity along a path from point A to point B with its uplink blind spot detector. By collecting and measuring connectivity data insights, Ericsson Routes’ planning capabilities also help fleet managers address connectivity questions as new deployment areas are considered. 
Ericsson Routes has now expanded its service to the MIZ, making it available to the current and future leading mobility companies operating there. In addition, in partnership with Hillwood, Ericsson Routes will test and expand support for drone connectivity later this year. 
For more information about the AllianceTexasMIZ, please go here.
If you’re a player in the autonomous or connected vehicle space or a drone company interested in trying out Ericsson Routes, please find more information here. 
Ericsson is a technology partner to automakers, connectivity providers, and hyperscalers alike – moving the automotive ecosystem forward in multiple collaborative efforts, including managing connectivity and digital services. Ericsson Routes is an Ericsson ONE incubated project. Ericsson ONE is Ericsson’s accelerator for internal growth businesses. Read more about it here.

In late February, Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) suspended all deliveries to customers in Russia. In the light of recent events and of European Union sanctions, the company will now suspend its affected business with customers in Russia indefinitely. Ericsson is engaging with customers and partners regarding the indefinite suspension of the affected business. The priority is to focus on the safety and well-being of Ericsson employees in Russia and they will be placed on paid leave.
As a consequence, Ericsson records a SEK 0.9 b. provision in first quarter 2022 for impairment of assets and other exceptional costs. No staff redundancy cost is included. The provision will be recorded in Other Operating Expenses in Segment Networks. Around one third of this amount will impact cashflow.

Illinois Electric Cooperative (IEC), an Illinois-based electric service provider, has selected Ericsson, through its strategic partnership with XtremeLTE, to modernize networks in rural Pike County, Illinois. The project involves Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) delivered through the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) spectrum.
The new partnership, which is part of the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) Connect America Fund Phase II (CAF-II), will support IEC’s efforts to improve capacity, coverage, and user experience for its customers. The project deployed in the fourth quarter of 2021.
“Illinois Electric Cooperative is taking a major step towards expanding connectivity and broadband services in areas where they are unavailable,” said Matt Haverfield, Network Operations Manager for Illinois Electric Cooperative. “The selection of Ericsson, through their partnership with XtremeLTE, allows us to create private networks with superior uplink and downlink performance, and create an infrastructure that is affordable and enables reliable and quality communication services.”
IEC sought vendors that could comply with the FCC’s challenging Connect America Fund Phase II (CAF-II) Above-Baseline performance tier on a massive scale. After an extensive evaluation process, IEC through Vantage Point Solutions (a third-party independent engineering consultant firm) conducted a field test at XtremeLTE’s facility in Wellsboro, Pennsylvania, whereby the operator successfully demonstrated Ericsson FWA equipment’s capability in delivering a minimum 100 Mbps downlink and 20 Mbps uplink.
“CAF-II performance requirements are stringent, so a robust evaluation process was in the best interest of IEC’s long-term success,” says Jay Briscoe, Engineering Staff at Vantage Point Solutions. “Our team has enjoyed working with IEC on their FWA deployment in rural Illinois, and this process was an extension of that support. Vantage Point Solutions congratulates Ericsson and XtremeLTE on their selection.
Under the new agreement, XtremeLTE will be providing Ericsson Radio System which includes future-proof product lines supporting CBRS, as well as the Educational Broadcast Services (EBS) and Private LTE capabilities that were previously dependent on Wi-Fi technology.
The partnership will also bring Ericsson’s AIR 6488 Advanced Antenna System (AAS) solution to more than 50 sites across Illinois. AAS enables state-of-the-art beamforming and Massive MIMO, powerful tools for fostering large-scale deployments in existing and future mobile networks. Through these solutions, IEC will achieve significant performance gains, with the capability to upgrade to 5G New Radio (NR) when needed.
“CBRS in the 3.5GHz band will have big implications for building private LTE networks and in improving 4G and 5G service offerings,” said Bill Chotiner, Vice President & Chief Technology Officer for Customer Unit Regional Carriers, Ericsson North America. “This partnership allows us to continue bringing ultra-high-speed broadband to rural communities in America, and it comes at a critical time where service providers like Illinois Electric Cooperative are looking to scale their offerings, launch more use cases and protect existing services.”
Ericsson and the XtremeLTE strategic partnership was first announced in October 2019, and is focused on assisting the Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs) and the fixed wireless industry in obtaining and deploying Ericsson’s carrier-class LTE equipment. XtremeLTE creates a foundation for enabling full, end-to-end broadband deployment, where WISPs or FWA providers will be able to reach more customers with higher speeds, and wide-area coverage and capacity.
XtremeLTE is proud and excited to support IEC with their CAF II Fixed Wireless network project in rural Illinois. This project aligns perfectly with XtremeLTE’s mission of bringing fast reliable broadband services to rural communities that need immediate access to the Internet. XtremeLTE currently supports over 40 Fixed Wireless Access networks across the USA. Through XtremeLTE, these networks can provide service to their communities in months or even weeks, compared to waiting years for fiber.
David Tews, President of Xtreme LTE commented, “The combination of Ericsson’s technology and XtremeLTE’s unique ability to deliver quickly from our warehouse in Pennsylvania, has made it possible for us to deploy carrier grade networks in as little as 30 days. This rapid deployment solution helps our rural communities support the demand for high-speed Internet today.”

Private networks
                                 
                                                    


















To drive digitalization in the public sector, Dataport has commissioned the first private 5G standalone (SA) campus network in Hamburg for its new 5G test lab. Designed and built by O2 Telefónica with Ericsson’s Private 5G (EP5G), Dataport's 5G lab marks the start of 5G SA technology testing for the future data processing and throughput requirements of the public sector. Dataport expects 5G technology to boost efficiency and innovation in the field of networking, public administration and smart cities, and is making its laboratory available to interested companies and public institutions to gain experience with 5G.
Dataport and O2 Telefónica have agreed on a cooperation package for the construction and operation of Dataport's 5G lab, in which O2 Telefónica will provide additional engineering consulting support. This type of cooperation with O2 Telefónica will enable the company to develop its own applications, as well as build up technical know-how with regard to the operation and use of the 5G network.
Dr. Johann Bizer, Chairman of Dataport's Executive Board and responsible for the Solutions division, explains the goal of the 5G lab: ""Our 5G lab provides Hamburg's public institutions and companies with a development environment in which 5G applications and solutions can be planned, tested and optimized.""
""In Hamburg, we have set up a 5G campus network with our technology partner Ericsson, where Dataport can test the practical application of the for public administration,"" says Karsten Pradel, Director B2B of O2 Telefónica. ""I am convinced that Dataport will use the 5G lab to develop many new applications which will benefit the public sector.""
Being the first active 5G SA campus network in Hamburg, Dataport is establishing itself as an innovation driver in the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg (FHH). In this way, the company is making a fundamental contribution to digital public services in a changing digital society.
Private 5G campus network for Dataport's 5G lab
Dataport's 5G lab provides a secure, closed research and development environment where no data leaves Dataport's premises or the administrative IT network connected to the 5G campus network.
Dataport's 5G lab has network coverage both in the enclosed lab premises and in an open area. With this topographical design of the 5G campus network, it is possible to test indoor and outdoor applications under real world conditions.
In an initial test, Dataport is testing a 5G connection with a high data rate to the state network (working title: virtual state network connection, vLNA). The test is intended to determine the extent to which 5G technology can be used to provide faster and more cost-effective access to the state network for new or growing public properties (e.g., schools, city halls or public authorities). This is particularly relevant in places where no fiber optic lines are available.
Dataport's 5G lab is also positioned for expansion to other locations: In the future, Dataport could add 5G antennas to interested properties in Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Bremen and Saxony-Anhalt, providing cost-effective 5G network coverage, thanks to O2 Telefónica's scalable core network and Dataport's own fiber infrastructure.

Visitors at the Experience Hub can now enjoy speeds up to 600Mbps that allow for faster downloads, seamless browsing, low latency and streaming services.
The experience of up to 600Mbps speed is achieved with Radio Dot 4475 with Indoor Radio Unit (IRU) 8848 using 5G New Radio (NR) Time Division Duplex (TDD) Band 41 along with Band 3 in data aggregation mode – the first in the Middle East for this specific band combination. Radio Dot 4475 with Indoor Radio Unit (IRU) 8848 are part of the Ericsson Indoor 5G portfolio.
Stelios Savvides, Technology Director at Vodafone Oman, says: “With so much time spent at home, offices, shopping malls or in airports, the quality of indoor 5G coverage is quickly becoming a must-have for our customers. Enhancing the in-building user experience is a key priority for Vodafone Oman and the Ericsson 5G Radio Dot deployments at our flagship Experience Hub and our HQ offices are the first of many in this journey. We see the Ericsson Radio Dot System as the right solution to offer a superior indoor experience to our valuable customers.”
Radio Dot 4475, one of the smallest tri-band small cells and weighing just 1.5 kilograms, is a multi-band low-power radio transmitter with eight antenna elements. The IRU 8848 allows connections of up to eight next-generation Radio Dots in a single unit facilitating 5G and 4G deployment.

Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) launches the Ericsson Local Packet Gateway, enabling CSPs to unlock innovative edge opportunities in both hybrid private networks segments and on the network edge, to support high-data bandwidth and low-latency use cases. The Ericsson Local Packet Gateway is an all-in-one appliance – including hardware, Container-as-a-Service (CaaS), software and lifecycle management – that makes edge applications easy to deploy and manage.
The optimized cloud-native user plane and service functions will enable new 5G edge use cases. It has a very compact deployment in a one-server low footprint, with integrated lifecycle management enabling fast time-to-service for new edge use cases.
The Ericsson Local Packet Gateway brings dual-mode 5G Core user plane and network slicing to the edge, enabling both mobile broadband and enterprise use cases, from small user plane deployment in a CSP core network, to routing to local applications. Examples of CSP enterprise use cases include sport events applications, virtual reality (VR) gaming and augmented reality (AR) for inspecting factory quality.
Laurent Leboucher, Orange group CTO & Senior Vice President Orange Innovation Networks  says: “At Orange, we continue developing meaningful networks to adapt to the needs and uses all over the world. According to enterprise customers’ needs, a first option is to create a virtual private network on Orange’s public network. A second solution is to create a hybrid private network relying on shared equipment in the Orange network and dedicated equipment at the customer's site for critical flows and data. Ericsson’s 5G Core for standalone, including the Local Packet Gateway help us meet both these enterprise customers’ needs.”   
Monica Zethzon, Head of Solution Area Packet Core, Ericsson, says: “With the launch of the Ericsson Local Packet Gateway we have taken yet another step in supporting our CSP customers to address the enterprise market, by providing a powerful, slimmed-down user plane that’s easy to deploy at the edge, using an integrated lifecycle management making it easy to scale.”
Caroline Chappell, Research Director, AnalysysMason, says: “CSPs want flexibility in deploying 5G private networks and delivering network slices and will therefore need a user plane solution that is fast and easy to install and manage on customer premises. Ericsson Local Packet Gateway, with its pre-integrated, appliance-based solution including in-built lifecycle management and a form factor optimized for the enterprise edge, will be familiar from a management perspective and help with time-to-service for new enterprise use cases.”

                    Ericsson Time-Critical Communication strives to enable lag-free 5G  user experience
                





Launched in October 2021, Time-Critical Communication is an end-to-end software toolbox for 5G networks that delivers the consistent low latency and high reliability demanded by time-critical applications and services for consumers, enterprises, and public sector. For instance, it strives to enable lag-free games, immersive AR and VR sport events experience, seamless remote control in factories, and increased road safety.
The toolbox combines 3GPP-specified ultra-reliable, low latency communication (URLLC) standard with Ericsson innovations to mitigate major causes of latency, unlocking a wide range of latency-sensitive use cases in real-time media, remote control, mobility automation, and industrial control.
Marie Hogan, Head of Mobile Broadband Voice and New Business at Ericsson Networks, says: “It is heartening to see our effort to enable the benefits of 5G acknowledged by the industry. We will continue to work closely with our ecosystem partners to bring more time-critical use cases to life.”
Ericsson has been piloting 5G for time-critical use cases since 2017 with customers and industry partners in extensive proof of concept (PoC) demos and trials ranging from jet engine production, factory automation safety to driverless minibuses.   
Ericsson, together with a European communications service provider and other ecosystem partners, also recently showed at MWC 2022 the potential benefits of Time-Critical Communication for AR streaming applications with enhanced quality of experience.

                    Far EasTone joins Ericsson Startup 5G program to boost 5G application cases
                





Ericsson announced that Far EasTone (FET), a leading operator from Taiwan, has become the latest company signing up for Ericsson Startup 5G program, which is designed to help communication service providers (CSPs) capture the consumer potential of 5G. FET is the first CSP in Northeast Asia to enroll in the program, joining a lineup of word-leading operators such as AT&T, Telstra, and Rogers, to name a few.  
Through a curated network of more than 40 startups worldwide, the Ericsson Startup 5G program aims to help CSPs accelerate commercialization and monetization of 5G. The program is driven by the Ericsson ConsumerLab to foster innovation and collaboration across the 5G ecosystem, plugging into a wide range of sectors, including entertainment, education, gaming, sports, and social media. Bolstered by ConsumerLab’s 25 years of research on consumer behavior, insights and trends that impact the ICT industry, the program will also assist CSPs in developing go-to-market strategies while introducing the right partners to enable innovative services.  
With the ambition to maximize value for 5G users, FET has invested heavily in developing new value-added services within its 5G offering, including the recently announced 5G Metaverse Accelerator aiming to deepen the collaboration with local Taiwanese startups. On the other hand, the Ericsson Startup 5G program will allow FET to access a roster of worldwide startups to further amplify 5G use cases to drive substantial 5G uptake.
Chee Ching, President of Far EasTone Telecommunications, says: “With our solid partnership with Ericsson and leveraging advanced technologies such as Big data, AI, and IoT, we have established the world number one 5G network which offers the best performance and optimal experiences to our users. This lays a great foundation to build more social and immersive experiences utilizing AR and VR technologies that will eventually lead us to realize the Metaverse. I believe the Ericsson Startup 5G program will create a great synergy with the FET Metaverse Accelerator to develop more tangible 5G use cases that will transform people’s lives.”
Jasmeet Sethi, Head of ConsumerLab, Ericsson Research, says: “Our program aims to accelerate 5G innovation to open up a whole new world of advanced digital experiences for consumers in Taiwan. Our partnership with Far EasTone will continue to build on years of knowledge at ConsumerLab on consumer needs and a strong global startup partner ecosystem. We are eagerly looking forward to seeing the future unfold as we work together to define what the 5G powered metaverse can be.""
A global 5G consumer study conducted by ConsumerLab, representing opinions equivalent to 1.3 billion consumers and 220 million 5G users, showed that around 70 percent of 5G early adopters are looking for more innovative services. In Taiwan, the number is even higher with 74 percent.  Consequently, Taiwanese consumers are willing to pay up to 40 percent premium for 5G plans with bundled digital services, compared to a global average of 20-30 percent and just 10 percent for 5G connectivity.
“Bringing FET to the Ericsson Startup 5G program opens a new chapter in our long-term partnership,” said David Chou, President of Ericsson Taiwan. “FET has been a trailblazer in innovating 5G services on top of a superior network with our joint efforts. This constructive collaboration will further enable more promising consumer applications with differentiated services for Taiwan and to unlock the full potential of 5G. In the meantime, we look forward to connecting Taiwanese startups to an array of worldwide operators to accelerate 5G adoption within the ecosystem.”

If you are downloading or uploading a file on the go, need to run a videoconference, interacting with a business application, or having a gaming session from your mobile, it just works without any hassle.”
Ericsson Dynamic End-user Boost is offered as a service to reduce time to market and available to communications service providers globally. 
Zander adds: “The mobile application will allow service providers to better utilize unused capabilities in their networks. This is a great example of how we innovate to help service providers monetize their 4G and 5G network investments to the benefit of consumers, business users and enterprises.”
Ericsson Dynamic End-user Boost is powered by Ericsson One Network, a cloud-based intelligent platform based on flexible network application programming interfaces (APIs), making it easy for developers to innovate new applications on 5G.
Ericsson Dynamic End-user Boost is designed to be white labeled for service providers to sell under their own brand.

Ericsson and Vodafone create UK’s first on-demand 5G network slice



Ericsson and Vodafone have successfully completed the UK’s first 5G standalone (SA) network slicing trial in a joint lab demonstration to create on-demand 5G connectivity and dedicated performance for consumer and business customers.




News


Mar 15, 2022




5G
Network slicing
                                 
                                                    


















The lab trial, which is the first of its kind for a communications service provider in the UK, demonstrated an on-demand premium 5G network slice using Ericsson’s 5G Standalone containerized core architecture and end-to-end automated orchestrated solution, including 5G RAN slicing. The network slice was configured to provide the low latency and high bandwidth experience required for a virtual reality use case.
The process from placing an order to creation of the network slice to carry live network traffic took just 30 minutes, demonstrating the ability for CSPs to deliver new services with faster time to market for automated and customized connectivity.
Andrea Dona, Chief Network Officer, Vodafone UK, says: “Network slicing is an incredibly valuable step forward. By segmenting our network, and customising different slices for different requirements, we can bring to life new ideas that would be impossible otherwise. When we configure our network to empower new services, industries like gaming, entertainment and healthcare can enter a new era. What might seem like science fiction is one step closer thanks to network slicing.”
Andrea Spaccapietra, VP Digital Services, Ericsson UK & Ireland, says: “Network slicing will play a crucial role in enabling new and innovative 5G services for consumers and enterprises. With the tools to efficiently manage network resources and provide differentiated services with dedicated performance, leading network operators like Vodafone can enable new business model innovation and use cases across different sectors and unlock new revenue opportunities to realize the full potential of 5G.”
Network slicing is a new service for business customers and application developers, enabled by the deployment of 5G Standalone networks. The service allows CSPs to create multiple virtual network slices which operate across the same physical network. Each slice is isolated from other network traffic to give dedicated performance and eliminate the risk of network congestion, with the features of the slice tailored to the use case requirements.
By enabling on-demand 5G connectivity and dedicated performance, consumers and enterprises will be able to access a wider range of services and innovative applications that would otherwise not be possible, such as video-assisted remote operations, AR/VR, enhanced event experiences, cloud gaming, smart cities, and applications for Industry 4.0 and public safety.
 
Notes to Editor:
A recent in-depth study by Ericsson and Arthur D. Little - Network Slicing: A go-to-market guide to capture high revenue potential - explores the USD 200 billion value potential of network slicing for CSPs and estimates that 30 percent of the potential future 5G use cases will need network slicing as an enabler.

In 2021 Ericsson introduced a new vision to improve lives, redefine business and pioneer a sustainable future. Building on decades as a sustainability pioneer, the company has made a strong commitment to fulfilling this vision through its own efforts and through working across and beyond the ICT ecosystem.
This focus is reflected in Ericsson’s latest Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Report, which highlights its 2021 performance across the areas of responsible business, environmental sustainability and digital inclusion.
“Our sustainability-driven solutions and partnerships create real impact for our customers and our stakeholders,” says Heather Johnson, Ericsson’s Head of Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility.  “But they also create value for society, whether by enabling the reduction of emissions across industries, creating more energy-efficient networks or helping to bridge the digital divide. We made significant progress towards our sustainability goals in 2021, and we are now setting even more ambitious targets for the future.”
Performance and highlights
Net Zero: In 2021 Ericsson set a long-term ambition to be Net Zero by 2040 across its value chain. To meet this ambition, Ericsson will work towards 1.5°C aligned climate targets set by the Paris Agreement.
The first major milestone is to achieve Net Zero emissions from the company’s own activities by 2030 – as well as reducing emissions by 50 percent in its portfolio and supply chain also by 2030.  
Energy performance:  To meet customer expectations and help the telecom industry reach Net Zero, Ericsson has developed innovative solutions that enable operator networks to use as little energy as possible while managing expected growth in data traffic, meeting the needs of both current and future 5G networks.
In 2021, Ericsson achieved 36% energy savings from delivered Ericsson Radio System radios versus the legacy portfolio, surpassing the company’s approved Science Based Target of 35 percent one year ahead of schedule.
During 2021, Ericsson also launched a series of ultra-light Massive MIMO radios that are 10 percent more energy efficient than the previous generation.      
Digital inclusion: The digital divide continues to be a key challenge to global economic development with roughly 2.9 billion people still offline. With innovative technologies and services, Ericsson and its partners and customers are pioneering new ways to connect societies and improve lives. In 2021 Ericsson continued its partnership with UNICEF in support of the Giga initiative, helping to map schools and assessing their connectivity in 35 countries by the end of 2023.
Ericsson also made a commitment to positively impact one million children and youth by 2025 by providing access to digital learning and skill development programs as part of the World Economic Forum-aligned EDISON Alliance 1 Billion Lives Challenge. 
Corporate responsibility:  Ericsson continued its focus on health, safety and well-being in 2021, including a robust COVID-19 response that included a focus on employee mental health and access to vaccines in places where they were not easily accessible. In 2021 there was an increase in work-related fatalities compared to 2020, in contrast to the decreasing trend of recent years.  The company has declared this unacceptable and is more committed than ever to Target Zero – a goal of zero fatalities and lost workday incidents.
Ericsson launched its revised Code of Business Ethics, which defines both the company’s ethical principles and its expectations of responsibility across the value chain. The company also added integrity as one of its four core values as well as publishing a report on the human rights impact of 5G.
Ericsson's Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Report is part of the Company's Annual Report and externally assured by an independent third party. It is also produced in accordance with GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights Reporting Framework.

stc and Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) at Mobile World Congress 2022 in Barcelona, Spain to explore 5G capabilities and to strengthen stc’s 5G network indoor coverage and performance.
The collaboration between stc and Ericsson will explore the technical capabilities of 5G network slicing and long range mmWave for stc to expand their 5G network’s coverage and performance, elevate customer experience, and unleash the value of new services that can be introduced to consumers and enterprises.
As part of this collaboration, Ericsson will deliver a view on 5G for indoor coverage as well as identifying the indoor customer experience and possible ways of enhancement.  A proof of concept (PoC) will be offered to identify stc’s network evolution strategy using long range millimeter wave (mmWave) technology and to highlight the advantages and benefits of 5G network slicing.
Ericsson mmWave portfolio delivers multi-gigabit speeds, capacity, and exceptional mobile broadband speeds. Ericsson mmWave will directly benefit the high network capacity requirements in urban areas that include popular, crowded locations and hotspots that cater to a large number of users.
The Ericsson product range will deliver high-quality connectivity for outdoor coverage in populated areas and help drive strong indoor-mall coverage across stc network.
Badr Al-Lhieb, Infrastructure Sector VP, at stc says: “5G is completely reshaping both our professional and personal lives by connecting a large number of users. Through joint collaboration, Ericsson is supporting stc in realizing our digital ambitions and evolving it, with the latest technologies to enhance our network. The MoU is one of many steps we are undertaking together to bring the best and the latest technologies to our subscribers and to the Kingdom, in line with Saudi Vision 2030.“
 Mathias Johansson, Vice President and Head of Customer Unit Saudi Arabia and Egypt at Ericsson Middle East and Africa says: “One of Ericsson’s major focus areas is enabling the digital transformation of industries. We are working with stc to tap on the 5G potential to unleash new services that will elevate customer experience and expand network coverage for their consumers and enterprises. Hand-in-hand with stc to accelerate Saudi Vision 2030, we are certain that stc will reap the innovative benefits of the wide range of possibilities that 5G technology offers.”
The PoC will pave the way for network slicing on the stc network in the future. The capabilities of (mmWave) will be further enhanced with 5G network slicing services. Network slicing will play a crucial role in enabling stc offering innovative services to consumers and enterprises with flexibility and agility.

(L-R) Jerry Soper, Head of Ericsson Indonesia and Vikram Sinha, President Director and CEO of Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison signed a partnership for 4G and 5G RAN systems in Indonesia on Tuesday (1/3). Both parties announced their partnership at Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2022 in Barcelona. (L-R at the back) Peter Laurin, Senior Vice President, Head of Manage Services of Ericsson; Anders Rian, Key Account Manager Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison of Ericsson Indonesia; Nunzio Mirtillo, Head of Market Area South East Asia Oceania and India of Ericsson; Börje Ekholm, President and CEO of Ericsson; Desmond Cheung, Chief Technology Officer of Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison. This partnership is a continuation of Ericsson and Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison (IOH) collaboration in rolling out the 5G services in Jakarta that was first launched commercially in August 2021. 
Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison (IOH) and Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) today announced they have strengthened their partnership to further expand their 5G footprint in Indonesia. The partnership will support Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison's vision to become the most preferred digital telco in Indonesia by expanding 5G service coverage to several cities including Jakarta, Bogor, Tangerang, and Bekasi.  
The new rollouts are an expansion of the 5G services introduced by IOH together with Ericsson in Jakarta in August 2021. Besides Jakarta, IOH has  deployed 5G services in some other cities in Indonesia including Solo, Surabaya, and Makassar. 
The expanded 5G footprint in Indonesia by IOH and Ericsson will serve to support the  government’s digital transformation agenda for Indonesia. As a proven ICT leader as well as a long-standing partner to IOH, Ericsson is committed to drive society forward through its technologies and solutions. In this 5G rollout extension, Ericsson is powering the network through Radio 6626, a unique three-sector dual-band radio that will help IOH 5G network to increase its Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) 5G frequency capacity.  
Radio 6626 provides multi-standard and multi-band coverage while lowering costs and reducing footprint – up to 50 percent lower energy consumption. Through this collaboration, IOH and Ericsson are working together to provide a totally sustainable network within Indonesia by reducing the energy consumption of mobile services without impacting performance.  
Vikram Sinha, President Director and CEO of Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison, said: “This 5G network expansion is a realization of our commitment to support the Government’s mission to fulfil 5G coverage throughout Indonesia. We believe the 5G network will create a digital ecosystem that supports the needs of the digital economy. Through this strategic partnership, we are extending our commitment to the government to accelerate digital transformation in Indonesia.” 
Jerry Soper, Head of Ericsson Indonesia, says: “Ericsson is delighted to further strengthen its partnership with Indosat Ooredoo by providing 5G services in Jakarta, Bogor, Tangerang, and Bekasi. 5G will play a critical role in accelerating the digitalization of the economy and stimulating next-generation innovation for consumers and enterprises in Indonesia. We are confident that with our technology leadership and strong deployment capabilities across the globe, we will enable IOH to capture the full value of 5G connectivity through our energy-efficient products and solutions.” 
Ericsson currently has 170 commercial 5G agreements and contracts with unique communications service providers globally, including 114 live commercial 5G networks. 
Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison partnered with Ericsson has launched first commercial 5G services in Jakarta back in August 2021.
