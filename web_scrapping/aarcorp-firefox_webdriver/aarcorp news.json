(NYSE: AIR), a leading, global aerospace and defense company, today reported fourth quarter and full Fiscal Year 2014 consolidated results. Fourth quarter sales were $505.4 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.43. For the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year, the Company reported sales of $553.8 million and earnings per share of $0.01 after a $29.8 million charge related to the KC-10 program. Full year earnings per share for Fiscal Year 2014 are $1.83, as compared to $1.38 reported in Fiscal Year 2013. We are pleased with our overall performance in the fourth quarter, said David P. Storch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AAR CORP. In the Aviation Services segment we are seeing positive results from our investment in new supply chain programs that are ramping up, including new customers from the supply chain hub we established in Europe. We have put renewed emphasis on identifying and capturing new business for our MRO facilities and successfully competed and captured wide-body work for Aeromexico, a new customer. Our airlift business was selected by the DoD for new work in Africa and the Vertical Replenishment (VERTREP) program with the Navy. Overall we feel very good about our cash generation for the year allowing us to strengthen our balance sheet and continue to position the Company for growth. Fourth Quarter 2014 Results Fourth quarter consolidated sales were $505.4 million versus the prior year level of $553.8 million. Sales in the Aviation Services segment declined 10% to $373.8 million mainly due to softness at the Company s MRO facilities and fewer expeditionary airlift flying positions. Sales in the Technology Products segment declined 4% to $131.6 million, primarily due to lower sales of commercial cargo systems. During the fourth quarter, and in addition to the new contract wins announced during the March earnings call, AAR s Aviation Services segment: Acquired the inventory and customer contracts from Sabena technics. With this transaction, the Company established a major supply chain hub in Brussels, Belgium to serve customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Completed servicing of the 100th aircraft at our Duluth maintenance facility and renewed the long-term relationship with Air Canada by entering into a new five-year agreement to provide MRO services for Airbus narrow-body fleet of aircraft. Completed maintenance work on three B-767 commercial wide-body aircraft for Aeromexico, in addition to the two B-777 s previously announced. Subsequent to quarter-end, commenced operations of two fixed-wing aircraft for airlift support in Africa and expanded the contract positions with two additional rotary-wing aircraft. Airlift operations also expanded the VERTREP mission with two rotary-wing aircraft servicing the Navy fleet in the Mediterranean Sea, Arabian Gulf, and Indian and Western Pacific oceans. During the fourth quarter, AAR s Technology Products segment: Delivered the 400th lower-deck cargo system for Airbus A330 series. Received orders for more than 1,100 lightweight air cargo containers and pallets from China Southern Airlines. Sales to commercial customers represented 62% of consolidated sales as compared to 63% of consolidated sales in the same period last year, with government and defense customers represented the balance. In Aviation Services, sales to commercial customers represented 63% of segment sales, while in Technology Products sales to commercial customers represented 58% of segment sales. Consolidated gross profit margin for the fourth quarter on a reported basis was 17.0%, an improvement over the adjusted gross profit margin of 16.3% in prior year period. Net interest expense in the fourth quarter declined to $9.1 million. The Company reduced its net indebtedness by $89 million since June 1, 2013 Fourth quarter results included a $1.6 million tax benefit, which was offset by certain charges. During the fourth quarter, the Company generated $63.1 million in cash flow from operations and had capital expenditures of $5.3 million. The Company paid dividends totaling $3.0 million. Fiscal Year 2014 Results Full Fiscal Year 2014 consolidated sales were $2.04 billion. Aviation Services segment sales declined 3% to $1.56 billion as a result of lower airlift support and lower activity in MRO. Technology Products segment sales declined 9% to $475.0 million driven by an expected decline in demand for mobility products and lower commercial cargo sales. Sales to commercial customers were 59% of total sales as compared to 61% in fiscal 2013, with remainder of the sales to government and defense customers. For Fiscal Year 2014, the Company s weighted average diluted share count was 39.1 million, and the effective tax rate was 30.5%. The effective tax rate included the effects of certain credits, which vary depending upon the Company s level of expected taxable income. Fiscal 2015 Guidance For fiscal 2015, the Company currently expects consolidated sales in the range of $2.100 to $2.150 billion. The Company expects to see growth in its supply chain business and improvement in its maintenance, repair and overhaul businesses given its strong position in the growing global aviation services market. With defense budgets expected to remain under pressure, the Company sees ongoing demand for its low cost solutions, products and services and will continue to transition its portfolio of airlift aircraft. Due to the transition of the airlift portfolio and timing of up-take of supply chain contracts, the Company expects first quarter earnings per share to be softer than other quarters in the year, but that earnings per share will grow sequentially throughout 2015. For the full Fiscal Year 2015, the Company expects earnings per share to be in the range of $1.80 to $1.90.

The designation represents a milestone for AAR and distinguishes the company as an expert in the field of composites manufacturing capable of meeting the highest industry standards. Nadcap accreditation is a prerequisite for inclusion on the qualified product list for major aircraft OEMs including Boeing s A10 and 777, Bombardier s C-series, Sikorsky s S-92, Gulfstream, UTC-UTAS A320 and Triumph programs. The qualification follows an audit performed by the Performance Review Institute over the past five months. Satisfying these customer requirements demonstrates AAR s commitment to quality and opens the door to new business opportunities and expansion of key accounts. Acquiring this coveted accreditation in only five months after stating intent to pursue it is a phenomenal feat, said Daniel J. FitzPatrick, Vice President of Operations Composites for AAR. I commend the Clearwater employees for achieving this milestone on the very first attempt. Clearwater is the second AAR composites facility to earn Nadcap accreditation. Its Sacramento, CA, composites operation was accredited in September 2010 and re-certified in April 2014 with zero non-compliance findings, FitzPatrick said. That s almost unheard of in the industry, he added. Nadcap requires annual audits until the first two re-certifications achieve acceptable results. After that, audits are performed every 18 months. Unlike traditional third-party programs, Nadcap approval is granted based upon industry standards and reviewed by key business leaders who serve on the committee. Achieving Nadcap accreditation is not easy. It is one of the ways in which the aerospace industry identifies those who excel at manufacturing quality products through superior special processes, said Joe Pinto, Vice President and Chief Operating Officer at the Performance Review Institute. PRI is proud to support continual improvement in the aerospace industry by helping companies such as AAR in Clearwater to be successful. AAR is a leading one-stop-shop provider of primary and secondary structures, components and assemblies to OEMs and Tier 1 customers. About Nadcap Created in 1990 by SAE Inc., Nadcap is administered by the not-for-profit Performance Review Institute.

AAR Airlift is providing passenger and cargo transportation services, aerial delivery and logistics support for allied forces. The contract is valued at approximately $23 million, inclusive of all optional task orders. Due to the lack of infrastructure in much of Central Africa, U.S. forces rely on commercial providers like AAR Airlift to sustain in-theatre operations, said Jeff Wehrenberg, Chief Operating Office for AAR Airlift Group. AAR has an excellent record of performance in rugged environments and remote locations, and we see this region as a great expansion opportunity for the company. Through a competitive solicitation, USTRANSCOM initially awarded the contract to AAR Airlift Group in November 2013. Performance was delayed by multiple incumbent protests, ultimately resulting in USTRANSCOM re-evaluating proposals and selecting AAR Airlift again in May. AAR Airlift provides expeditionary airlift services in support of contingency operations worldwide. The company operates a fleet of fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft to transport personnel, supplies, and mail for the U.S. Department of Defense in Afghanistan and Africa, and provide vertical replenishment (VERTREP) services to the Military Sealift Command in the Western Pacific.

Cargolux launched the CAEROe product portfolio of cookie-sheet pallets, heavy gross weight pallets and fuel-saving containers on its Boeing 747s. The CAEROe (pronounced zero) pallets are up to 40 percent lighter than standard all-aluminum ULDs, but can carry more weight without additional strapping to the aircraft structure. The pallets are certified for strapping the maximum allowable load against the pallet edge rails by using tie-downs. This way, fewer ULD positions get blocked during heavy weight transport, providing extra space and, potentially, more revenue for the customer. The increased capacity in addition to the fuel and time savings we gain from using the CAEROe product line will provide the airline with a unique opportunity to increase mainstream revenue while at the same time save money and reduce carbon emissions, said Onno Pietersma, Sr. Vice President, Maintenance and Engineering, for Cargolux. We re excited to launch this new product line for Telair and believe CAEROe will set a new industry standard. By working closely with the industry on cargo loading systems, Telair s designers observed mismatches between ULDs and aircraft capabilities. The CAEROe product line addresses common challenges.

AAR is announcing a five-year multi-million dollar agreement with Kenya Airways to provide power-by-the-hour component support for its fleet of 737NG aircraft. AAR will place inventory on site in Nairobi while offering additional rotable pool support from its newly established supply chain hub in Brussels. With assistance from U.S. Department of Commerce leadership and staff in Washington, D.C., Chicago, and the U.S. Embassy in Kenya,AAR s top executives were able to connect with key government and business officials beginning last year during a visit to Nairobi, Kenya; meet legal requirements; establish business protocols; and cultivate relationships. The successful advocacy strategy was also supported by several inter-agency partners including the State Department. The advocacy and access AAR gained through the Commerce Department s program gave us an advantage in the face of stiff competition from European companies, said AAR CORP. Chairman and CEO David P. Storch. The administration s support was key to enabling us to navigate the business landscape. This deal with Kenya Airways has helped to progress AAR s expansion across the African continent. Doing Business in Africa (DBIA), first announced in December 2012, was designed to close the opportunity gap between American business and emerging markets in Africa, home to seven of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Obama administration efforts include enhanced outreach from Commerce and interagency partners to provide American companies with leads and introductions; and advocate for and connect businesses with distributors and potential customers. The success of AAR in Kenya is an excellent example of how the National Export Initiative is working to help U.S. businesses leverage new export opportunities in emerging markets and around the world, said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker. I know from my recent trade mission that many U.S. companies are selling to Africa, but it can be a challenging market for many American businesses. That is why the Commerce Department is assisting American businesses as they navigate new markets, reach new customers, and develop new opportunities in existing markets. When U.S. companies succeed, the benefits are mutually shared in the form of new economic opportunity at home and abroad. This deal builds on AAR s recent progress in establishing a foothold in Africa. Last year, AAR fulfilled a contract to service landing gear on Kenya Airways Boeing 777s. AAR also supplies cargo systems for South African Airways and participated in the MRO Africa Conference and Exhibition in Ethiopia, focused on the build-out of Africa s aviation industry. Through efforts like these, Americans and Africans can begin to understand the mutually beneficial relationships both our economies need to sustain and grow, said Kenya Airways CEO Titus Naikuni. We appreciate the Obama administration s help in connecting us with AAR s services that will reduce our costs so we can continue to grow.
