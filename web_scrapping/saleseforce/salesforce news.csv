0,"April 20, 2022",Salesforce Invites Future Tech Leaders to San Francisco for New Computer Science Pre-Internship,"

At Salesforce, we love our Futureforce interns. Every summer, they share their energy, passion and innovation with us — questioning the old way of doing things, taking on projects that have a real impact on the business, and making our employees, company, and communities better for having worked with them.
Our Futureforce program has helped us attract, retain, and cultivate the next generation of leaders at Salesforce, some of the most diverse and global employees at the company. We continue to invest in our interns and each year we convert up to 80% of our eligible interns to full-time employees.
Today, we’re proud to expand the program with Futureforce Tech Launchpad, a new pre-internship program, powered by CodePath, that will provide underrepresented students in computer science access to hands-on technical training, capstone projects, and mentorship earlier in their career journeys.
Developing the next generation of tech leaders
Starting in June 2022, we’ll invite 25 rising college juniors to our headquarters at Salesforce Tower in San Francisco for a 10-week, in-person experience with technical curriculum and one-on-one mentorship with Salesforce employees.
Students will be introduced to full-stack web development, and gain an understanding of database, back-end code, front-end code, testing, design and deployment, culminating in a capstone project of their choosing that will be presented to Salesforce employees and peers. In addition to technical skills, students will develop soft skills, such as networking, collaboration, communication, and presentation.
All of our pre-interns will receive compensation, benefits, and a relocation stipend to help maximize the experience and be immersed in the Salesforce culture. They will have opportunities to connect and collaborate with our Futureforce interns, so they can hopefully return as interns and, ultimately, as employees after graduation. And just like all of our Futureforce interns, Launchpad participants will receive paid Volunteer Time Off (VTO) to devote to causes they believe in.
To bring this program to life, Salesforce is partnering with CodePath, a nonprofit committed to increasing diversity in tech by transforming college computer science education for underrepresented minorities and underserved populations. CodePath will work in partnership with more than 70 universities, including HBCUs and HSIs, as well as its community of over 10,000 students to help identify computer science and engineering students to participate in the Futureforce Tech Launchpad. CodePath will also provide the curriculum and instructors for the program.
“Underrepresented minority and low-income students in computer science (CS) are more likely to drop out or switch majors before their junior year, and as a result, miss out on the work experience needed to launch successful tech careers,” said Michael Ellison, CEO at CodePath. “Salesforce’s decision to launch the Futureforce Tech Launchpad demonstrates inspiring corporate leadership and represents a bold commitment to eliminate systemic inequities in both computer science education and technical recruiting for communities of color.”
We look forward to welcoming, and learning from, the next generation of tech leaders this summer. We are committed to building a diverse pipeline of engineers and technical talent, and making meaningful careers in software engineering accessible to all.

1,"April 20, 2022",Salesforce Announces New Customer 360 for Education Capabilities to Power the Future of Learning,"

According to the Salesforce Connected Student Report, 58% of higher education staff say their institutions are increasing investment in supporting learners from anywhere with more flexible, personalized experiences. The report also notes that while many students and a high percentage of staff prefer a high level of face-to face engagement, one in four students said that having more flexible courses and part-time offerings would help them succeed.With Customer 360 for Education, institutions can create their Student 360 to drive digital transformation across recruitment, admissions, the student experience, alumni relations, and marketing to deliver connected experiences from anywhere.

At the 10th annual Education Summit, Salesforce announced expanded offerings to help higher education institutions provide digital-first, flexible learning options; real-time and asynchronous collaboration; and personalized experiences for students, faculty, and staff. Customers such as Arizona State University (ASU) and INSEAD are already tapping into these new capabilities to meet growing student needs.  
“Institutions recognize the importance of having a strong digital foundation to support the experiences that today’s students and alumni demand,” said Susan Morrow, GM for Education Cloud at Salesforce. “Customer 360 for Education enables colleges and universities of all sizes to build their Student 360 and rapidly build new programs, such as executive education and flexible learning programs.”
Every Institution Can Create Their Student 360 with New Customer 360 for Education Capabilities
Enable digital-first, flexible experiences for the next generation of students 
As reported by Salesforce’s Digital Skills Index, 76% of the workforce feels unprepared for the future of work. Additionally, according to Salesforce’s Connected Student Report, 45% of higher education staff say their institutions are implementing new business models, such as credentialing or executive education courses, to provide flexible learning options and drive new revenue streams as undergraduate enrollment rates decrease. With Lifelong Learning, institutions can implement next-generation, digital-first experiences that make it easy for students to find tailored programs and courses. These “storefront”-style digital experiences surface programs such as elective and non-credit courses or certificates relevant to students’ interests and career growth, similar to how they experience an ecommerce site. Using Lifelong Learning, students can also access a self-service center that helps them easily add relevant courses to their purchase carts, complete registration, and manage payment all in one place. 


 Lifelong Learning powers executive, continuing, and online education programs to help institutions accelerate growth with streamlined student journeys.
72% of higher education staff globally said adjusting to virtual work has been a top challenge. With Digital Campus, institutions can become more connected to students, staff, and faculty with communication, collaboration, and insights tools in a single, easy-to-use, customized workspace whether they are on campus, in their living room, or traveling. With a student-centric One Stop as part of the Digital Campus, students, staff, and faculty can access on-demand support and services with easy-to-use search functions, chatbots, and live agent support. 


Support, engage, and retain your constituents from anywhere with the Digital Campus solution built for hybrid institutions of all sizes.
With Admissions Connect, institutions can streamline the admissions experience for both applicants and staff. With the Application Form Builder, admissions teams can now easily build customized, branded applications with clicks, not code. Because the forms are built using the power of the Salesforce platform, institutions can automate importing existing applicant data, such as education history, directly into the application.   
Real-time and asynchronous collaboration to support students from anywhere  Institutions around the globe are already using Slack to improve engagement and collaboration in real time or asynchronously. Now, with Student Success Alerts powered by Slack, faculty and staff can more efficiently support students and streamline communication between faculty and student-support staff in today’s education-from-anywhere world. For example, faculty can quickly raise alerts about at-risk students from an easy-to-use Slack app that feeds directly into Student Success Hub, streamlining communication between frontline faculty and instructors.

Personalize student and alumni relationships
Digital Marketing and Engagement helps institutions deliver personalized content, such as targeted onboarding journeys for new students, that foster a greater feeling of belonging in an online environment. For example, institutions can create tailored messaging and reminders — such as tips for moving into a specific dorm or ways to connect with students in the same major, virtually — as part of onboarding journeys.Relationship-Driven Fundraising makes it easy for institutions to identify alumni for targeted fundraising campaigns and create more personalized and engaging online giving experiences.
Customers like ASU and INSEAD are innovating for the future 
With Customer 360 for Education, ASU is creating lifelong student relationships from prospective students to engaged alumni. The university is putting their customers at the center of the ASU experience with flexible learning options across campus, online, or via a hybrid approach. “A big part of what makes ASU innovative is its commitment to, and energy for, scale and growth. Among a suite of tools, a platform like Salesforce supports that ambition,” said Lev Gonick, Chief Information Officer at ASU. “We contextualize innovation and apply it to purpose — a lot of the work we’ve done with Salesforce is informed by joining technology, innovation and student success.” 
Recognizing that many prospective students are balancing careers in addition to returning to school, INSEAD needed to deliver a hyper-personalized recruitment experience for its more than 20,000 executives globally. INSEAD also uses Customer 360 for Education to manage its entire recruitment experience from one unified platform.“As hybrid learning becomes the norm, personal connections are as crucial in executive education as they are in the workplace,” said Séverine Guilloux, Executive Director of Open Programmes and Online Learning Innovation at INSEAD. “With Customer 360 for Education, we can deliver connected learning journeys with a personal touch and create long-lasting relationships with our participants and community of students.”

Salesforce’s growth helps drive giving efforts
By giving 1% of equity, product, and employee time back to its communities, Salesforce’s ability to give is directly tied to company growth. With overall revenue up 26% year-over-year, the ways in which Salesforce is able to give continues to expand. 
In addition to monetary giving, more than 54,000 nonprofits and education organizations have received free or discounted product from Salesforce.org, and Salesforce employees have given over 6.7 million volunteer hours to their communities.
Salesforce’s giving goes further as company acquisitions boost giving
As the company grows through acquisitions, philanthropic reach grows even wider:
Since its founding in 2014, Tableau Foundation has contributed nearly $100 million in software services and financial support to nearly 11,000 organizations working in more than 125 countries. In 2021, Slack donated $54 million to the Salesforce Foundation to support community investments. MuleSoft employees have donated $988,000 in all-time giving.

3,"April 13, 2022",Salesforce Launches New Initiatives to Grow Sustainable Ocean-Based Carbon Markets,"

Salesforce and global environmental NGOs will co-lead effort to help define high-quality blue carbon projects and credits 
Salesforce joins ORRAA to help drive their commitment of $500 million to strengthen climate resilience of coastal communities
Salesforce hires UN leader Tim Christophersen as incoming Vice President of Climate Action
Today at the Our Ocean Conference convened in the Republic of Palau, Salesforce announced a global collaborative effort aimed at driving consistent standards around high-quality blue carbon projects and credits. 
Blue carbon is the carbon captured by ocean and coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves and seagrasses, that is increasingly used by companies to offset their carbon emissions on their paths to reach net zero by 2050.
As businesses, investors and governments look to scale the blue carbon market, it’s critical that investments are made in high quality projects while also yielding community leadership, transparency, and standardization.
“We want to leverage the power of nature to capture carbon and fight climate change. As investments in the blue carbon market grow, we must ensure that projects truly safeguard biodiversity, protect coastal and marine ecosystems, and ultimately improve the livelihoods of people in local communities,” said Whitney Johnston,  Ph.D., Director of Ocean Sustainability at Salesforce. 
The initiative will be co-led by Salesforce and leading environmental organizations, including the World Economic Forum’s Friends of Ocean Action, Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance (ORRAA), Conservation International, and The Nature Conservancy, along with the Meridian Institute, to support the stakeholder engagement process. A draft set of principles and definitions will be circulated for public comment in June 2022 at the United Nations Ocean Conference in Lisbon. 
As Salesforce decarbonizes its business, we’re leveraging technology, philanthropy,  mobilization, policy, and investments in nature-based solutions to reach our climate goals”Dr Whitney Johnston, Director of ocean sustainability, salesforce
As part of its ongoing commitment to help develop the emerging blue carbon market, Salesforce set a goal to purchase 1 million tons of high-quality blue carbon credits, equivalent to more than $10 million USD, over the next four years.
“As Salesforce decarbonizes its business, we’re leveraging technology, philanthropy, mobilization, policy, and investments in nature-based solutions to reach our climate goals,” said Dr. Johnston.
Salesforce joins ORRAA to increase investment in ocean protection
Several factors — including pollution, over-extraction, habitat damage and climate change — have imperiled the ocean economy. By 2050, 800 million people globally will be vulnerable to coastal flooding and storm surges from rising sea levels. Coastal ecosystems, like reefs and mangroves, serve as powerful buffers against storms and flooding, and support livelihoods, food security, and culture. However, less than 1% of the total value of the ocean has been invested in sustainable projects through philanthropy and official development assistance. 
That’s why Salesforce is joining ORRAA, a multi-stakeholder collaboration with a goal to drive at least $500 million of investment into coastal projects by 2030. The United States also announced its support for ORRAA, including a $1 million contribution.
“At the moment, there are too few on-the-ground solutions which can be a source for high-quality, verifiable blue carbon credit products ready to go to market, and no clear benchmarks or definitions of what a high-quality blue carbon product is – or should be,” said Karen Sack, Executive Director, ORRAA. “It is also important to develop demand-side guardrails to ensure that blue carbon credits are additional – not an alternative – to efforts to reach net zero. We are delighted that Salesforce is joining ORRAA and to be working jointly with them and other partners on this effort.”
Since founding the Ocean Sustainability Program in 2021, Salesforce has given nearly $3 million through philanthropy to organizations working to conserve and restore coastal and marine ecosystems.
Salesforce hires former UN head of nature based solutions 
Salesforce has hired global sustainability leader Tim Christophersen as the incoming Vice President of Climate Action to drive Salesforce’s strategy around nature-based solutions to climate challenges, and accelerate the company’s international sustainability work.

“Science tells us that it’s now or never to take climate action. We’re already experiencing the first effects of climate change, from extreme weather events and wildfires, to rapid loss of biodiversity, and growing global inequality,” said Christophersen. 
“Businesses can quickly and decisively scale up all the right solutions now for people, nature and climate laid out by the latest IPCC report. That’s why I’m proud to join Salesforce and leverage its full power on behalf of our planet.”
Before joining Salesforce, Christophersen served as the head of Nature for the Climate Branch, and Coordinator of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration at the United Nations Environment Programme. He holds a degree in forestry from the Dresden University of Technology in Germany, and will be based in Denmark.

5,"April 12, 2022",Salesforce Gives $11M to Restore Ecosystems and Advance Climate Justice,"

Donations will go to 12 global nonprofits — including American Forests, the Ocean Foundation, and World Resources Institute — to enhance natural carbon sinks, protect biodiversity, and foster green job creation
At Net Zero Summit in Washington, D.C., Salesforce announced the first round of donations from its Ecosystem Restoration & Climate Justice Fund. Announced in late 2021, the global climate fund will invest a total of $100 million over 10 years toward key climate initiatives. 
“We believe that philanthropy can be a powerful tool in fighting climate change,” said Naomi Morenzoni, Senior Vice President of Philanthropy, Salesforce. “Climate change impacts everyone, and it disproportionately affects the world’s most vulnerable communities. Through our philanthropic donations, we aim to support organizations that work with local communities to find meaningful, nature-based climate solutions.”
Climate change impacts everyone, and it disproportionately affects the world’s most vulnerable communities.Naomi Morenzoni, Senior Vice President of Philanthropy, Salesforce
Salesforce philanthropy efforts accelerate sustainability goals
Global philanthropic funding related to climate change is minimal compared with the scale of the challenge. As companies continue to transform their business to reach net zero and help build a more sustainable future, they have an opportunity to leverage philanthropy as a key tool — driving climate action and investing risk-tolerant capital that supports, tests, and scales climate solutions. Once proven, these projects can attract funding from other sources to bring them to scale. 
Climate change, the loss of biodiversity, and the impact on the most vulnerable people among us are inextricably interconnected — but their solutions can be too. By focusing on three key areas, Salesforce’s philanthropy work can strategically align with the company’s goal to build a more sustainable future for all and drive impact at scale:
Climate: Scientists are telling us it’s “now or never” — greenhouse gas emissions must peak by 2025 if we want to prevent a climate catastrophe, according to the IPCC report released last week. Salesforce’s philanthropy supports initiatives that increase nature’s capacity to remove and store carbon, to reach net zero, and avoid a 1.5°C tipping point.Biodiversity: The world is in the middle of a biodiversity crisis. According to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services’ recent report, an estimated million species are threatened with extinction. Protecting and restoring living species that support resilient ecosystems and communities is a critical pillar of the work Salesforce funds.Livelihoods: Climate change impacts every individual, and it disproportionately affects the poorest and most vulnerable, amplifying global inequality. Salesforce focuses on supporting adaptation measures, like greening urban areas with trees and leveraging coastal ecosystems as “living” infrastructure to protect communities from storms and sea level rise. These solutions make communities more resilient to climate change, while also driving local job creation in marginalized communities. 
Salesforce donations reach organizations and climate-based projects across the globe
The first grantees of Salesforce’s global climate fund include 12 organizations with innovative approaches to addressing climate change through nature-based solutions: 
American Forests: American Forests is the oldest national nonprofit conservation organization in the United States. The donation will support the advancement of healthy urban tree canopies through the development of data-driven tools, planting trees in under resourced and some communities of color, and investing in career pathways in urban forestry, expanding the organization’s Tree Equity movement and climate-informed forest restoration to protect communities from the impacts of deforestation and mitigate the chance of catastrophic wildfires.Arbor Day Foundation: The Arbor Day Foundation is the largest nonprofit organization dedicated to planting trees. This donation will support partnerships and programs that restore forests, engage communities, and foster tree-planting in Canada, the U.K., the United States and Indigenous communities in tropical forest settings globally. Conservation International (CI): Conservation International is a nonprofit environmental organization that partners with governments, companies, civil society, Indigenous peoples and local communities to help people and nature thrive together. This donation will support Conservation International’s initiatives to deliver high impact climate mitigation, adaptation, biodiversity and livelihood benefits in Guyana and other global locations.Fundación Natura: Fundación Natura works to restore and conserve the ecosystems of Colombia, safeguarding endangered, endemic, and emblematic species, while supporting the livelihoods of local communities and the ecosystems on which they depend. This donation will support the continuity of the conservation and restoration efforts under the Amazon 2.0 project, with a focus on addressing deforestation and improving climate and water regulation in the Colombian Amazon rainforest, while strengthening relations between local farmers and local indigenous communities.National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF): NFWF is the nation’s largest private conservation grant-maker, protecting and restoring wildlife, plants, and habitats in all 50 states and U.S. territories. This donation will support the creation and enhancement of urban habitats, the reduction of urban heat island effects, increasing community capacity to execute conservation strategies, restoring waterways and coastal habitats and developing local green job opportunities. One Tree Planted: One Tree Planted is an environmental nonprofit dedicated to reforestation efforts around the world through tree planting. This donation will support reforestation, biodiversity conservation, and job creation through community-engaged planting projects across Australia, Brazil, and India.Restor: Restor is a science and community driven platform whose mission is to support and accelerate the restoration of Earth’s ecosystems. This donation will support Restor’s continued growth, including advancing and integrating scalable biodiversity monitoring on the platform to serve responsible restoration projects around the globe. Save The Bay: Save The Bay is the largest regional nonprofit working to protect and restore San Francisco Bay for people and wildlife. The donation will support Save The Bay’s wetland restoration initiatives, which include establishing tidal marsh transition zones, and supporting native plant nurseries throughout the Bay Area.The Nature Conservancy: The Nature Conservancy is a global environmental nonprofit working to create a world where people and nature can thrive. This donation will support land restoration, conservation and job creation through community-engaged projects in Papua New Guinea and other global locations.The Ocean Foundation: The Ocean Foundation supports organizations dedicated to reversing the destruction of ocean environments globally. This donation will support the Blue Resilience Initiative, focused on increasing the blue carbon capacity and resilience of coastal ecosystems in Mexico and Puerto Rico. Wetlands International: Wetlands International inspires and mobilizes society to safeguard and restore wetlands for people and nature. This donation will support the “To Plant or Not to Plant” program, focused on enhancing the ecological integrity of over one million hectares of land and seascapes through mangrove restoration in Guinea-Bissau, Tanzania, the Philippines, and Indonesia.World Resources Institute (WRI): WRI is a global nonprofit organization that implements practical solutions to improve people’s lives and protect nature. This donation will support the organization’s Land Accelerator program in Brazil and India, which provides training, technical assistance, and mentorship to entrepreneurs focused on restoring degraded forests and farmland.
Salesforce has been on a sustainability journey for more than a decade. Today, the company has net zero emissions across its entire value chain and has achieved 100% renewable energy for its global operations. It has also established sustainability as a core company value, and is executing on a comprehensive Climate Action Plan to drive toward a 1.5°C future.

6,"April 12, 2022",Salesforce Launches No-Code Tool to Help Automate Government Program Delivery,"

At World Tour Washington, D.C., Salesforce announced general availability of Business Rules Engine, a no-code rules automation tool that enables public servants to build, test, and automate complex policy-based rules with just a few clicks. 
This lets governments set up speedy automations that perform complex calculations  — for example, determining if constituents qualify for food assistance or if a service member is eligible for a reenlistment bonus.
Why it’s important: According to a recent  survey, government CIOs cited low code and no code as the top emerging IT trends with expected impact on their agencies over the next few years. Many CIOs initially tested these tools over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic to quickly launch solutions for housing assistance, unemployment programs, and scheduling COVID-19 tests. 
Rather than waiting on limited IT teams to make program updates, public sector organizations were able to respond faster to changing mission needs.
The Salesforce perspective: “No-code digital tools deliver tremendous value to the public sector by empowering their employees, regardless of technical expertise, to build and evolve the digital solutions they need to effectively serve their constituents,” said Nasi Jazayeri, EVP and GM of Public Sector, Salesforce. “As agencies face new crises and shifting legislative policies, Salesforce’s Business Rules Engine ensures that there is no delay in carrying out their missions and delivering benefits to qualified applicants.” 
Driving the news: Business Rules Engine empowers business users, regardless of their technical expertise, to update the digital tools and rules they use to carry out policies. Many government programs can be quite complex, making eligibility decisions and explaining those decisions to constituents difficult. Licensing and permitting, HR processes like personnel action requests, and grant programs such as unemployment assistance, SNAP, and Medicaid, all require complex decision logic.
By dragging and dropping formulas or reusing templates, users can quickly launch new programs that automate decisions while being able to easily modify them in concert with changing mission needs.  



Salesforce’s Business Rules Engine value to the public sector includes:
No-code, flexible platform for faster service: Business users can build, test, and execute rules within Salesforce with just a few clicks, while also taking advantage of templates to quickly launch application portals that automatically process applications against thousands of rules. Faster resolution for constituents: Rather than submitting an application into a queue for manual review, constituents are able to input their personal information into a form that updates dynamically, and then quickly receive an answer on whether they qualify for certain benefits, such as unemployment insurance or housing assistance. Applications are then automatically passed along to a case worker for final approval, ensuring minimal delay in benefits being distributed.
What’s next: Salesforce will be rolling out Business Rules Engine to other industries to help automate policy decisions in the second quarter.

7,"April 12, 2022","Salesforce Announces CRM Analytics, AI-Based Insights for Sales, Marketing, and Service Teams in Every Industry","

Today at World Tour Washington, D.C., Salesforce launched CRM Analytics with new innovations that surface AI-powered, actionable insights directly in the flow of work. These technologies help sales leaders, service leaders, and employees across any industry — including financial services, manufacturing, consumer goods, and communications — put data at the center of every customer relationship and ultimately, deliver more personalized experiences.
Recent studies reveal that data-driven experiences are critical to customer relationships and business success:
Most customers (78%) are more likely to repurchase from companies that personalize experiences (McKinsey).Companies using data-driven practices report above-market growth of +15% (McKinsey).
“Every Customer 360 digital transformation is a data transformation,” said Susan Emerson, Senior Vice President, Global Product Go-to-Market, Salesforce. “That’s why we built CRM Analytics — a complete, scalable, AI-powered data and analytics platform native to Salesforce. It enables Salesforce customers across every industry to inject visual and predictive insights and recommendations on the next best action deeply into the flow of work.”
Salesforce CRM Analytics innovations infuse predictive and prescriptive insights directly in any customer’s workflow 
Data, analytics, and AI are the foundation of every digital enterprise in which functional insights drive business outcomes. Salesforce’s CRM Analytics, formerly known as Tableau CRM, helps turn customer-facing teams across industries into trusted advisors by allowing them to collaborate and act on AI-powered predictions and prescriptive recommendations. CRM Analytics innovations announced today include:
CRM Analytics App for Slack puts data at the center of every conversation by integrating directly into an employee’s workflow, making analytics more visible, collaborative, and actionable.Predictions in Slack surfaces aggregated predictions from Salesforce Reports directly into the Slack workflow to help people better analyze deals at risk, customers at risk of leaving or invoices at risk of getting delayed.Search Insights uses natural language to search from the analytics landing page within CRM Analytics. Search Insights also helps all Salesforce customers* discover any dashboard, dataset, and next best groupings related to the search.Energy & Utilities Analytics provides deeper insights into Energy & Utilities sales processes, such as opportunities likely to close. This reduces time to quote with guided, flexible, and actionable next steps built into the Salesforce workflow.
Public Sector Analytics offers greater insight into department efficiency and compliance management with actionable intelligence inside the Salesforce workflow.

Industry Intelligence leverages out-of-box best practices to boost sales and revenue cycles
In February, Salesforce announced Revenue Intelligence, bringing Sales Cloud together with CRM Analytics for a unified revenue management command center that equips sales leaders with insights throughout the sales and revenue cycles. With Revenue Intelligence, teams receive AI-led insights on deals that have higher likelihood to convert, and deeper visibility into how their forecast is changing over time. In Summer ‘22, Salesforce will introduce four new, industry-tailored versions of Revenue Intelligence, including:
Financial Services Intelligence for Financial Services Cloud offers a complete intelligence platform for wealth, banking, and finance with pre-built industry KPIs and best practices.Manufacturing Intelligence for Manufacturing Cloud allows people to understand account profiles and build a unified view of their value chain with 50+ out-of-the-box metrics.Consumer Goods Intelligence for Consumer Goods Cloud delivers relevant descriptive and predictive analytics (BI+AI) powered by Einstein Discovery for strategic, operational, and tactical insights.Communications Intelligence for Communications Cloud provides AI-powered advanced analytics for Communications Service Providers.

9,"April 11, 2022",Standing with Ukraine,"
As the war in Ukraine persists with its heartbreaking impact on the courageous Ukrainian people and their loved ones around the world, we’re continuing our support of humanitarian efforts in the region.
Together with our employees we’ve now donated more than $4 million USD to address basic needs, support refugees, and advance food security across Ukraine and bordering countries — working with our core partners of World Central Kitchen, UNHCR (the UN Refugee Agency), and the International Committee of the Red Cross. We’re encouraging our employees to continue to donate to our trusted nonprofit partners and Salesforce will continue to match those donations.
In March, we partnered with Flexport.org to send the equivalent of a plane load of supplies — including hospital beds, medical kits and school supplies to Eastern Europe.
In addition, Salesforce technology is powering more than 30 humanitarian organizations in the region, including the Polish Red Cross.
Our hearts remain with the people of Ukraine and their loved ones as they endure incredible adversity. We will continue to take action to support those impacted by these tragic events.

March 7, 2022
We are heartbroken by the violence and loss of life due to the invasion of Ukraine. We stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people and we are hopeful for an expedient path to peace.
While we do not have offices or employees in the region, we are supporting our employees who have loved ones there. Salesforce and our employees are donating an initial $2 million to nonprofit relief organizations working to help people in Ukraine and those who are being displaced. And we are accelerating our work to address the humanitarian crisis.
We do not have a material business in Russia. Through resellers and other channels we have a very small number of Russia-based customers, and we began exiting those relationships last week.
Our hearts go out to the people of Ukraine, their loved ones, and all of those affected.

10,"April 6, 2022",How Three Companies from Radically Different Industries Are Humanizing the Customer Experience with Salesforce,"

This week, Salesforce introduced new Service and Marketing Cloud innovations around AI-powered conversational intelligence, augmented reality, and Customer Data Platform.  These features give organizations across industries the tools to provide personalized experiences tailored to the unique needs of their specific customers.
Driving the news: Salesforce customers Bose, Honeywell, and John Muir Health are using Service and Marketing Cloud to drive lifelong customer relationships.
Bose selects Salesforce to expand direct-to-consumer business amid shifts in retail
Known as a leader in premium audio products, Bose is deploying Salesforce Customer 360 to provide personalized and tailored shopping experiences that delight customers and build loyalty.
With Marketing Cloud, Bose will streamline interactions across channels and deliver a personalized experience for customers.With Service Cloud Voice, Bose will empower agents to deliver world-class customer service and elevate the brand experience.Bose will also use Commerce Cloud to accelerate revenue growth and drive digital sales; MuleSoft to connect Bose’s back-end systems; and Einstein to drive hyper-personalization across channels. In addition, Salesforce’s Marketing Cloud Customer Data Platform will allow Bose to reimagine and enhance its customer data to engage faster and in more personalized ways.
“Customer experience is at the center of everything we do,” said Jim Mollica, Chief Marketing Officer, Bose. “With Salesforce, we will be taking our digital footprint to a different level – making it easier for customers to immerse themselves in the brand and delivering highly personalized, premium shopping and service experiences. We know this is critical to enhancing customer satisfaction and building loyalty.”
With Salesforce, Honeywell improves service and achieves sustainability goals
It is vital for Honeywell, a leading technology innovator, to arm their frontline mobile workers with valuable information to operate safely and productively.
Salesforce’s Service Cloud and Field Service, paired with Honeywell Forge, creates a cohesive service management process that allows Honeywell to dispatch technicians for on-site product maintenance and connected, proactive asset management.As a global leader for the world’s environmental sustainability enablement, Honeywell plays both roles of assisting companies reach their goals, while maintaining the highest levels of its set targets. In part, optimizing field service operations helps Honeywell maintain its sustainability goals. This transformation has led to a huge reduction in miles driven, and a carbon usage reduction of more than 150 tons.
“We are preparing for the next 100 years of our business, ensuring our customers are getting an intelligent, connected experience through Honeywell Forge and Salesforce,” said Stuart McCormick, Global Service Process & Tools Leader, Honeywell. “With Salesforce Field Service we are improving our occupant experience, making our operations more efficient, and reducing our carbon footprint.”
John Muir Health uses Salesforce to revolutionize the patient experience
John Muir Health is committed to putting patients and their needs at the center of the health system and is using Salesforce to realize that commitment.
John Muir Health is implementing Salesforce’s Customer Data Platform (CDP) to unify all their data and build a more complete picture of the patients their doctors, hospitals and care facilities serve.John Muir Health will also use Marketing Cloud and Health Cloud to improve real-time patient communication and strengthen their digital care journey. They will be able to respond to issues, survey patients, and answer care inquiries on the communication channels that are most convenient for the patient and their loved ones, such as email and SMS.
“With CDP and patient experience solutions, our patient experience team is able to have all the necessary patient data in one place to provide a contextual, personal, and human experience at a time when trusted support is most critical,” said David Hook, Executive Director of Marketing & Digital Consumer Experience at John Muir Health. “This technology helps us to truly focus on empathy and put the patient at the center of everything we do.”

11,"April 6, 2022",New Salesforce Service and Marketing Innovations Use Trusted Data and AI to Humanize Customer Interactions,"

83% of customers are more loyal to companies that provide consistent experiences across departments1Bose, MECCA, and Honeywell are building lifelong customer relationships with AI-powered innovations from Salesforce
Salesforce today introduced new Service and Marketing Cloud features that humanize the customer experience with new AI-powered conversational intelligence, mobile offline access to relevant information, and Customer Data Platform innovations. These technologies help service teams and marketers create more personalized experiences that drive lifelong customer relationships for every industry including retail, manufacturing and healthcare.
Rising inflation is shrinking consumers’ buying power and forcing them to scrutinize their spending. With 88% of customers saying the experience a company provides is as important as its products and services,2 companies must provide personalized experiences that remove friction and foster trust and loyalty. 
“Seventy-six percent of customers expect companies to understand their unique needs, yet only 34% feel like companies actually treat them as individuals,” said Lidiane Jones, EVP & GM, Salesforce Digital Experiences. “Any company not investing in this area is putting their entire business at risk. With Salesforce’s powerful service and marketing innovations layered with AI, businesses can deliver the personalized, connected experiences that build trust, loyalty, and longevity with customers.”
Service Cloud Innovations: Digitizing voice turns agents to trusted advisors
Seventy-nine percent of service professionals say it’s impossible to provide great service without full customer context. With new Voice innovations agents can become trusted advisors, delivering more personalized interactions, driving more value from purchases, and solving problems fast. The next generation of Service Cloud makes it easier for companies to deliver personalized experiences at scale, leveraging new data and AI capabilities. These innovations will empower agents to create more empathetic, human experiences, which are critical to fostering customer loyalty.
Contact Lens for Amazon Connect offers advanced conversational transcription for even the longest phone calls, real-time sentiment analysis, real-time supervisor alerts to deliver agent coaching and full-text search on call transcripts. Powered by machine learning, AWS Contact Lens will be natively supported for customers using Service Cloud Voice with Amazon Connect. For example, an internet provider company can easily follow sentiment and trends of customer conversations in real time to identify key product feedback, and better coach and manage agents based on sentiment and keywords. 
New Service Cloud partners Google Cloud and Genesys will each offer customers more choice in how they use Service Cloud Voice and enable AI-powered recommendations and automated workflows for their teams. With new telephone connectors from both Google Cloud and Genesys, companies may integrate phone and customer data, automate call transcriptions and notes, and enable agents to receive real-time suggestions while they’re on a customer call. For example, a service agent at a retailer can receive recommended next-best actions to process a return or upsell a warranty, making the conversation more personalized and useful to the customer.
Field Service Innovations: Mobile workers can provide and get support from anywhere
With skills shortages affecting field service teams, it is more important than ever to scale service efficiently. Salesforce Field Service’s modern mobile platform can connect teams on the frontline with their headquarters, with other subject matter experts in the field, and with customers. Field service workers can access the information they need to get their jobs done even if they are offline, and service technicians can use augmented reality to help customers resolve issues.
Workers providing in-person service with the Salesforce Field Service App now have a Multi-level Offline Briefcase to serve up necessary records whether or not they are online. For jobs like repairing telecommunications equipment after a storm, mobile workers need complete asset, contract, and customer data, for quick decision making regardless of cell signal. Personalized work plans, flows, inventory information, and knowledge articles all in one app allow the technician to focus on the customer at hand.
Visual Remote Assistant now gives customers the option to schedule in advance and initiate a 1:1 virtual support session with augmented reality from their phone. Companies can reduce truck rolls and give customers options for faster resolution. For example, customers can schedule a virtual session with an appliance technician to show what is going on with their dishwasher, and the technician can point, draw on the screen, and overlay information and direction for the customer on how to solve the problem in real-time on their own. 
Marketing Cloud Innovations: New CDP and Intelligence features to better know your customers
Only 33% of marketers are fully satisfied with their ability to create more relevant experiences with customer data. The next generation of Customer Data Platform, formerly known as Salesforce CDP, helps marketers create a single source of truth so they can get to know their customer and engage with relevancy at scale and in real time. New CDP innovations announced today include:
With Streaming Insights and Data Actions, marketers can capture near real-time data signals, such as a new customer, a recent product transaction, or payment issue, to trigger workflow events. For example, a new car purchase triggers an email campaign inviting the new customer to set up their driver profile, share on social media, and get a discount on their first car wash.
Advanced Identity Resolution uses AI to match and merge disparate data for better customer identification. Duplicated fields — such as address, email, or phone, as well as records with names that have multiple spellings or frequently shortened nicknames, as in “Sam” and “Samantha” — can be merged to help ensure the most complete customer profiles. For example, a car manufacturer can now understand a customer’s identity and experiences across their dealership to their service department.
New Anonymous Profiles enables marketers to track profiles and build a rich history of data on customers when they are in the anonymous state and then connect that data to their profiles once they become known. An online retailer can analyze a web visitor’s interactions, stitching data together when they have signed in to the site with their previous interactions, allowing for better personalization like improved product recommendations.
Marketing Cloud Intelligence, formerly known as Datorama, helps marketers unify analytics and leverage AI insights to continually optimize outcomes that increase customer value and growth. New Intelligence innovations announced today include:
New enhancements to Intelligence Reports for Engagement* help marketers shift from email open rates due to privacy changes. Now organizations can evaluate email performance by device, client, OS, and browser and optimize new KPIs for conversions, clicks by link, bounce types, unsubscribes, complaints, and click event lag. For example, a healthcare marketer can now better understand which channels and content best engage new patients to complete their onboarding journey before a first visit.Intelligence now enables marketers to explore and analyze deep data sets with new interactive visualization tools to easily compare currencies, channels, campaigns, time series, business units and more in a single customizable view. For example, a marketer in a media subscription business can now uncover optimal and wasted budget spend by analyzing the cost per acquisition and customer lifetime value of new and returning subscribers, and adjust budget plans and strategies accordingly.
*Formerly known as Datorama Reports for Marketing Cloud
Additionally, our next generation Marketing Cloud portfolio is now more aligned with the language marketers already use, so the capabilities and value are easy to understand.
Customers in every industry focus on the customer journey with Salesforce
Bose, a leader in premium audio products, is deploying Salesforce Customer 360 to expand its robust direct-to-consumer business, providing personalized and tailored marketing and service experiences that delight customers and build loyalty. “Customer experience is at the center of everything we do,” said Jim Mollica, Chief Marketing Officer, Bose. “With Salesforce, we will be taking our digital footprint to a different level – making it easier for customers to immerse themselves in the brand and delivering highly personalized, premium shopping and service experiences. We know this is critical to enhancing customer satisfaction and building loyalty.”
MECCA, the largest premium beauty retailer in Australia and New Zealand, is using Salesforce to deliver innovative and personalized digital experiences for customers. “Salesforce Service and Marketing Clouds are helping us focus on three areas to bring the magic of our in-store experience to the digital world,” said Sam Bain, Chief Digital Office, MECCA. “We want to bring service to our customers in a really human way, bring education and storytelling to help customers pick the right products for them, and tailor it to make it as personalized as possible.”
Honeywell, a leading technology innovator, arms their frontline mobile workers with valuable information to operate safely and productively. “We are preparing for the next 100 years of our business, ensuring our customers are getting an intelligent, connected experience through Honeywell Forge and Salesforce,” said Stuart McCormick, Global Service Process & Tools Leader, Honeywell. “With Salesforce Field Service we are improving our occupant experience, making our operations more efficient, and reducing our carbon footprint.”

15,"March 30, 2022",Shoe Carnival Steps Up Unified Shopping Experiences with Salesforce,"

Footwear retailer Shoe Carnival attracted and retained loyal shoppers while growing its digital revenue by 174% in 2020 using Salesforce Customer 360 for Retail. 
The nearly 400-location retailer accelerated its omnichannel journey by bringing traditional store experiences online, personalizing marketing across all channels, automating connected customer service, and continuing to grow its buy online pickup in store (BOPIS) offering.
Why it’s important: Despite a difficult macro environment for retailers, Shoe Carnival noted in its recent earnings call that customers are shopping in its stores at record levels. The company also generated more profit for shareholders in 2021 than in the prior six years combined.
Driving the news: Shoe Carnival is deeply invested in driving personalized shopping experiences in its stores. While most retailers offer the same paper coupons and bulk discounts, Shoe Carnival takes a unique approach and is known for giving customers the chance to spin a carnival wheel in stores to receive a discount at checkout. 
When the pandemic forced nonessential retailers to shut their doors, Shoe Carnival brought that same engaging experience to life in the digital world with personalized marketing campaigns that seamlessly connected online and offline engagement. 
Shoe Carnival launched a “spin the virtual wheel” experience* where shoppers text “WHEEL” to an SMS short code and can play for a discount. Subsequent SMS offers then drove shoppers to the website and back in-store for repeat purchases.
Today, confirmation emails also now include AI-powered, personalized recommendations based on each shopper’s profile in Salesforce’s Customer Data Platform, providing a convenient way for customers to purchase related items.
Explore further: Customer 360 for Retail provides a single, connected platform helping retailers transform every aspect of their business, acquire and engage loyal customers, create compelling commerce experiences, and deliver consistent service to shoppers at every moment. Customer 360 for Retail linked online and store engagement for Shoe Carnival shoppers to help grow market share and revenue by: 
Easily scaling its digital platform as online revenue surged 3x when the pandemic closed storefronts in Q2 2020.Delivering connected and consistent service with the addition of chatbots to shoecarnival.com. For Shoe Carnival, this decreased manual chat intervention by over 90%, reducing cost and boosting customer service agent productivity.Enabling customer service agents to access customer history and loyalty status within Salesforce immediately without changing applications, improving agent effectivenessReducing friction in the BOPIS process as usage grew over 200% from 2019 to 2021.
The customer view: Deb Hannah, SVP Marketing at Shoe Carnival, said:
“The work we did with Salesforce to make sure that our infrastructure was sound is what enabled us literally, within the pandemic, to 3x our business over the period when our stores were closed.”“We didn’t furlough employees early in the pandemic, which enabled us to quickly process the surge in online orders, and to later fulfill the huge growth in BOPIS.”“Automated triggers, analytics, the ability to easily build new journeys and incorporate AI-powered recommendations – all of these marketing capabilities are key to making our engagements with customers more personalized.”
The Salesforce Perspective: “Retailers like Shoe Carnival are harnessing the full power of Customer 360 for Retail to seamlessly personalize engagement across touchpoints,” said Rob Garf, VP and GM, Retail at Salesforce. “The ability to operationalize data and insights to enable targeted marketing campaigns, drive relevant product recommendations, and deliver consistent service is fundamental to attracting and retaining loyal shoppers.”
What’s next: In addition to leveraging Salesforce’s marketing analytics capabilities for actionable insights and shopper engagement, Shoe Carnival will expand its Shoe Perks loyalty program with a Salesforce solution to further drive shopper loyalty.

16,"March 30, 2022",2022 Equal Pay Update: The Salesforce Approach to Pay Fairness,"

In 2015, we were one of the first companies to evaluate whether there were any gaps in pay among our global workforce. Such a simple idea — equal pay for equal work. At the time, it was pretty progressive, but since then more companies have joined us in committing to equal pay.
We’re glad to see the progress we’ve made as an industry but, as we know, there is no finish line when it comes to equality. Equal pay should be table stakes and as expected as an earnings call or an annual report, which is why we’ve incorporated it directly into our annual compensation process.
Early on in our equal pay journey, we learned that you cannot fix it once and move on. Many factors contribute to pay inequality. When you acquire companies you also acquire their pay scales. Market dynamics, like higher inflationary times and competition for talent, can affect it too. So that’s why we audit for equal pay every year and adjust as needed.
Today, we’ve completed our latest fiscal year compensation review, and with it our seventh equal pay assessment of nearly 70,000 global employees at the time of the audit — including Slack, our company’s largest acquisition that closed last year.
Our analysis found 8.5% of our global employees required adjustments. Of those, 92% were based on gender globally, and 8% were based on race or ethnicity in the U.S. As a result, we spent $5.6 million to address any unexplained differences in pay, a total of more than $22 million spent since 2015.
We continue to incorporate stock grants into our analysis to have a more complete picture of employee compensation. We started last year and continued this year by looking at eligibility, which we did not find had any discrepancies among gender or race.
We’re proud of the progress we’ve made and our enduring commitment to equal pay, and we know that equal pay is only one component of pay fairness.
We’re also continuously evaluating our processes to increase the scope of our analysis — adding stock and new demographics over the years — while also focusing on our broader programs, policies, and benefits that will continue to help our employees succeed.
We’ve been on our equal pay journey for the better part of a decade, but we’re nowhere near the finish line. We’ll continue to prioritize equal pay and advocate for pay fairness. Today, we’re proud to join the World Economic Forum’s Gender Parity Alliance as a founding member to accelerate these efforts industrywide.

17,"March 23, 2022",The Municipality of Rome Launches Smart Citizenship Platform with Salesforce,"

Salesforce, the global leader in CRM, today announced that the Municipality of Rome has chosen Salesforce to create an Integrated Citizen Relationship Management platform.  
Why it’s important: By bringing together Rome Municipality’s 15 city halls and many public administration services, the platform will help the Municipality build a digital-first, human-centric relationship with its three million citizens.
With a unique digital identity, and from any device, citizens can log into the MyRhome online portal and access local public services (including from academic institutions), submit and track inquiries, and monitor progress on interactions.
Driving the news: Leveraging Salesforce Service Cloud and Marketing Cloud will deliver omni-channel self-service capabilities, seamless collaboration between local government departments, and empower citizens to receive the information they need faster through AI-powered chatbots.
The launch of the MyRhome platform is another step on the Municipality’s path to creating a “smart city” — an ecosystem of public and private stakeholders serving citizens wherever they are.
What they’re saying: Paola Di Maio, CRM and Innovation Manager Municipality of Rome, said of the platform: 
“Rome lives for its citizens, but also for tourists, investors and stakeholders all over the world. Taking care of these relationships is at the heart of everything we do. Serving our citizens digitally is enhancing the quality, accessibility and speed of government administration for all.”“Digital Innovation is not just reinventing how the Municipality operates, for example in terms of reducing maintenance costs and boosting our sustainability efforts. It is continually reimagining our approach to administration.”“We are excited to partner with Salesforce to make the city of Rome a ‘platform city.’ This smarter, flexible platform will make our citizens’ lives easier and services ever more customized, and local government more effective for everyone.”
The Salesforce perspective: Federico Della Casa, Senior Vice President, Salesforce Public Sector Southern Europe, Middle East and Africa (SEMEA) said of the platform: 
“Amid the accelerated adoption of digital technologies, increasingly governments around the world recognize the need to bring government and citizens together and embed resilience into everything they do.” “The Municipality of Rome’s new CRM strategy demonstrates the power of private and public sector collaboration to provide a key resource for citizens who require easy access to information regarding their city’s programs and services.”“Enabling the Municipality of Rome to better understand and respond to their citizens’ needs, through flexible and personalized service wherever they are will make the citizen journey fit for an all-digital world.”

18,"March 16, 2022","Salesforce Introduces Marketing and Commerce Cloud Features Designed to Deliver Secure, Personalized Digital Health Experiences","

At HIMSS 2022, Salesforce unveiled innovations across Customer 360 for Health, including updates to Patient Data Platform* and Patient Commerce Portal**. These new features, powered by Marketing Cloud and Commerce Cloud, enable healthcare and life sciences companies to create personalized digital experiences while safeguarding patient data.
Why it’s important: Patient-centricity and maintaining trust across the entire customer journey are now table stakes. But healthcare and life sciences leaders have recently cited challenges with collaboration, data unification, connected journeys for engagement, and cohesive digital customer experiences — each of which were accelerated by the pandemic. 
47% of consumers believe healthcare and life sciences companies are more focused on industry needs than patient needs.In addition, 51% of consumers said they are concerned about the future of privacy in healthcare as technology evolves. 
Driving the news: Healthcare organizations need digital-first solutions to help strengthen patient relationships and improve health outcomes while securely connecting data to create personalized digital experiences. New features from Salesforce’s Customer 360 for Health draw on the full power of Salesforce to improve each of these areas to create trusted, connected relationships between patients, providers and payers from anywhere.  
Details:
Patient Data Platform*, which integrates with Patient Unified Health Scoring, enables healthcare experience managers to unify disconnected data sources to create a single source of truth of their patients’ and members’ profiles – with privacy and security measures built in to help customers connect all of their end customer data in a single place while also enabling customers to meet their HIPAA compliance responsibilities. For example, a provider can unify patient clinical data with demographic data to deliver personalized engagement and recommendations during the care process, from preauthorization and preparation to post-care recovery.Patient Commerce Portal** enables healthcare and life sciences companies, such as pharmaceutical and medical device suppliers, to move into new direct-to-patient selling channels with patient privacy in mind, creating personalized shopping experiences while helping companies to meet their relevant HIPAA compliance needs. For example, patients with cystic fibrosis who require high-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) vests could purchase the devices directly through a medical equipment company rather than through a physician, with the assurance that their personal health information is secure.
Out-of-the-Box Encryption for Commerce Cloud allows healthcare and life sciences organizations to launch digital storefronts faster by enabling such organizations to re-evaluate priorities, such as the need for custom platform development for encrypted data. Now, Commerce Cloud customers can quickly and easily store patients’ protected health information (PHI) and other sensitive data with an additional layer of security, designed so it can be accessed only by authorized users with access to encryption keys. This helps maintain consumer and patient trust while freeing up developer time. 
The industry perspective: “Salesforce’s announcement of Commerce Cloud now enabling HIPAA compliance across ecommerce channels has real benefit to prospective customers,” said Stephen Hurrell, VP and Research Director for the Office of Revenue at Ventana Research. “This means prospective users can focus more on speedily delivering value to their customers and patients avoiding delays and complexity caused by the need for customizations and third party specialist consulting help.”

19,"March 16, 2022",Salesforce Delivers the Future of Patient Health with New Innovations,"
Customer 360 for Health draws on the full power of Salesforce to deliver relevant solutions for healthcare and life sciences companies, creating trusted, connected relationships between patients, providers and payers from anywhere. New innovations include Patient Care Coordination, Patient Virtual Care, Patient Unified Health Scoring, Patient Data Platform and Patient Commerce Portal. To meet the growing demand for nimble, digital-first solutions, healthcare and life sciences organizations must deliver clinical self-care and wellness services remotely, while securely improving patient access to care and therapy.
At HIMSS 2022, Salesforce announced it will expand its offerings for healthcare and life sciences companies with new innovations across Salesforce’s Customer 360 for Health. Companies including Teladoc Health and Ovation Medical will utilize these new capabilities, which build on existing offerings rolled out in 2021.
Research shows that COVID-19 transformed patient and employee preferences and altered the future of healthcare and life sciences. Delivering personalized care in non-traditional settings – at home, in a retail health clinic, or even through a digital portal — is part of a growing trend that patients, providers and customers alike now seek.
“Healthcare leaders are looking to create streamlined ways for their employees to collaborate while keeping patients at the center of care,” said Kevin Riley, SVP & General Manager, Healthcare and Life Sciences, Salesforce. “These new innovations make that possible and help healthcare and life sciences organizations of all shapes and sizes adapt and grow in more tech-enabled ways.” 
Delivering patient-first care from anywhere
Patient Care Coordination enabled by Slack will allow care teams and healthcare organizations to access apps that help improve patient case management and outcomes. Care coordinators will be able to connect with colleagues through alerts, messages and workflows from a secure platform. For example, if a patient has an urgent post-visit question, the care team can connect with the physician via Slack to quickly address the issue.
Forty-seven percent of lower-income consumers experience challenges with transportation to doctor’s appointments. With Patient Virtual Care, providers will have the framework to connect with their patients remotely and schedule check-ins, complementing traditional in-person visits. For example, a patient whose lack of transportation makes it difficult to get to their appointment on time could use Virtual Care to connect with their physician virtually.

Open Image ModalPatient Virtual Care will help enable healthcare professionals to triage, plan, and deliver care digitally, delivering the convenience of care from anywhere.

Offering insight into a patient’s whole health 
With Patient Unified Health Scoring, care teams, providers and payers can combine clinical data — such as blood pressure and temperature — with non-clinical data —  such as demographic and environmental information — to provide a more holistic view of the patient. Patient Unified Health Scoring also provides actionable insights that can help identify potential risks the patients may face and help inform the next best course of action for that patient.
Patient Unified Health Scoring is integrated with the Patient Data Platform*, which helps customers connect all of their end customer data in a single place while also meeting their HIPAA compliant responsibilities. Now, patient and member experience managers can capture and segment patient and member data from disparate systems to help create a more patient holistic profile, personalize the engagement, and recommend follow-up care and programs for prevention.

Open Image ModalPatient Data Platform unifies and connects all enterprise data. With this scaled set of data, patient and member experience managers are provided with rich insights to drive success.

“Salesforce’s new innovations will enable organizations to provide care from anywhere, and offer insight into clinical and medical risks at the population level,” said Amit Khanna, SVP of Health Cloud, Salesforce. “We’re excited to empower healthcare and life sciences organizations with the technology they need to personalize service and communications at scale by keeping patient-centric experiences top of mind.”
Safeguarding patient data with expanded features to enable HIPAA compliance 
Patient Commerce Portal* helps B2B companies handle patient data so they can deliver scalable and personalized direct-to-consumer shopping experiences for patients while meeting their HIPAA compliance responsibilities. For example, a medical device company that typically fulfills orders for glucose monitors through doctors’ offices could now sell directly to consumers that manage their own care, while still safeguarding their patient data. In addition, healthcare organizations can set permissions around certain pieces of patient information on a need to know basis, upholding data security standards while maintaining customer trust.

Open Image ModalPatient Data Commerce helps enable customers to meet their HIPAA-compliance responsibilities across multiple channels and is available for B2B customers, including pharmaceutical and medical device companies.

Customers like Teladoc and Ovation Medical are creating patient-first experiences with Salesforce Customer 360
Teladoc Health, a leading provider of virtual care services, is further enabling its technology stack to support patient care at scale. “By implementing innovations from across the Salesforce Customer 360, Teladoc is partnering with Salesforce to further advance its operations, logistics, and post-appointment care to deliver transformative, whole-person virtual care,” said Claus Jensen, Chief Innovation Officer at Teladoc Health. Ovation Medical uses Commerce Cloud to help deliver more secure engagements with their customers online. “As a company focused on providing orthopedic and podiatry equipment to thousands of medical facilities throughout the U.S., secure automation and agility are key to our business operations,” said Erik Rost, VP of Sales at Ovation Medical. “Salesforce enables us to provide our customers with a secure portal for online orders and to put our current accounts on autopilot with peace of mind, freeing up our representatives to engage in meaningful conversations about new medical products and how we can further assist our customers.”

21,"March 15, 2022",Salesforce Launches Intelligent AppExchange Homepage with Easy App Discovery,"


The homepage is the first in a series of planned innovations to make it easier for customers to find the right apps, experts, and content on AppExchange
Today, Salesforce is thrilled to announce a new, intelligent AppExchange homepage experience that makes it easier than ever for customers to discover relevant apps, experts, and content. 
Salesforce AppExchange has long served as the hub of the Salesforce ecosystem, connecting customers to more than 7,000 pre-built partner apps and certified consultants that extend Salesforce across all products and industries. In fact, 91% of Salesforce customers use AppExchange apps — and customers have installed these apps more than 10 million times. 
Find best-fit apps with personalized intelligence



The new AppExchange homepage builds on this legacy by offering unique, data-driven experiences made increasingly powerful by each customer’s Trailblazer ID — a single identity that provides a unified login experience across Salesforce properties like AppExchange, Trailhead, and Salesforce Help. Recommendations on the new homepage are personalized and curated based on user preferences, search history, industry, and more. 
The new homepage also offers insights based on a customer’s Salesforce history. For example, if a customer uses or has shown interest in Sales Cloud, Marketing Cloud, and Tableau Analytics, their AppExchange homepage will curate apps that integrate with those specific products – extending their Customer 360 experience further.

22,"March 9, 2022",Salesforce Report Shows Consumer Spending Dips 5% — Inflation Persists,"

February shopping data from more than one billion consumers using Salesforce Commerce Cloud globally found that with less purchasing power, U.S. consumers placed fewer orders and purchased fewer items than last year at the same time. As inflation drove higher prices, however, U.S. retailers saw online revenue grow 6% year-over-year (YoY). On the other hand, global online revenue saw a 5% YoY decrease in the same timeframe. 
The Salesforce perspective:  “Challenges that consumers experienced over the holidays, including inflation and low inventory, haven’t dissipated in the new year,” said Rob Garf, VP and GM of Retail, Salesforce. “While digital commerce continues to prevail, it’s clear that inflation is having an impact on overall consumer spending. With these persistent headwinds, retailers must remove friction and enhance experiences by knitting together offline and online shopping.” 
February by the numbers:

Following a holiday season with modest growth, digital commerce sales in February grew by 6% YoY in the U.S. and decreased by 5% YoY globally. February order volume was down 11% YoY and the items per order decreased by 1.3% YoY (3.79 items versus 3.84 items in 2021)Prices for consumers in the U.S. rose 11.2% YoY in February while globally prices increased by 4.4% YoY.  Product inventory in February shrank by -1% in the U.S. and -5% globally as retailers and consumers continued to grapple with supply chain issues.  Product categories with the highest price growth in February YoY include: Home, Furniture (21.8%)Home, Appliances (17.9%)Home, Dining, Art & Decor (11%) Product categories with least price growth in February include: Active Footwear (1.3%)General Footwear (.8%)Electronics and Accessories (.5%)
Zoom out: Retailers and consumers are grappling with higher prices as labor, inventory issues, and last-mile costs drive up the cost of goods. President Joe Biden spent much of his first State of the Union address addressing the issue of inflation and promising to lower costs for American families.

The Salesforce Shopping Index uncovers the true shopping story through analyzing the activity of more than one billion shoppers across more than 54 countries powered by Commerce Cloud. Several factors are subsequently applied to extrapolate projections and actuals for the broader retail industry.

27,"March 2, 2022",Hello Atlanta: Salesforce Tower Top Floor Opens to the Community,"
Today, we’re thrilled to open the 34th floor — the top floor — of Salesforce Tower Atlanta to our employees, customers, partners, and the local community. After two years of working mostly remotely, the 34th floor, which we call the ‘Ohana Floor, is a flexible space where people can come to collaborate and connect with each other. The open floor plan includes shared spaces and seating to optimize collaboration and networking. Guests can enjoy the barista bar, chef’s table, and stunning views.
“I’ve worked at Salesforce for nearly four years, and my amazing colleagues make me excited to go to work every day,” said Aubree Broadwater, Salesforce Manager, Equality Enablement. “I look at the ‘Ohana Floor as the physical representation of my community and workplace coming together. From viewing the skyline of my hometown Atlanta to connecting with my BOLDforce family, being in this space is fun, vibrant, and makes me feel blessed to be part of Salesforce Atlanta.”
In addition to Salesforce employees, customers, and partners, the space will be open to local nonprofits, NGOs, and foundations that are aligned with Salesforce’s values of Trust, Customer Success, Innovation, Equality, and Sustainability. Community members can submit a request to use the space for free to host charitable fundraisers, receptions, and special events that have a focus on humanitarian, social, educational, or environmental causes. To date, events on our ‘Ohana Floors have raised more than $18 million for non-profit organizations around the world.
“Salesforce has contributed to the innovation, economic growth and social impact in Atlanta for years,” said Doug Shipman, Atlanta City Council President. “The opening of the Salesforce Tower Atlanta ‘Ohana Floor is another example of how the company continues to invest in the community. We’re delighted to have this beautiful space available to our city.”

Salesforce’s continued growth in Atlanta
Salesforce Atlanta is one of our southernmost campuses in the United States, and allows us to attract and retain the best and most diverse pool of highly skilled employees in an area known as the Silicon Peach.
In 2018, we made a public commitment to our continued growth in Atlanta with a pledge to hire 600 people over the next five years. Today, we’ve nearly doubled that hiring commitment — more than a year ahead of schedule — having onboarded more than 1,000 people in Atlanta over the past three years alone.
We’ve been able to scale our award-winning culture and are proud that Salesforce has been ranked one of Atlanta’s top workplaces for seven years in a row.
Our culture of giving back
As we continue to grow in Atlanta, so does our ability to contribute to the local community. Through our 1-1-1 model of philanthropy, Salesforce has contributed $4.6 million in grants to local nonprofits, and our employees have volunteered more than 71,000 hours in Atlanta.
All of our global towers will feature an ‘Ohana Floor to continue to give back to our communities around the world. Today, Salesforce Towers Atlanta, San Francisco, New York, London, and Indianapolis are open, with more on the way in Tokyo, Chicago, Sydney, and Dublin.
Our global campus will continue to play an important role in how we collaborate, connect, and drive culture.

The company is committed to growing its global footprint with four new towers expected to open over the next two years
The future of work is here. With our Success from Anywhere approach, employees now have the flexibility to work how, when, and where works best for them. 
But digital first does not mean digital only. Our physical spaces are critical to collaboration, innovation, and connection. While our employees resoundingly enjoy the flexibility our new approach offers, their number one request is to get together in person with their teams. That’s why we’re investing in our global campus and reimagining our spaces as a destination for collaborating and connecting.

Creating a “destination workplace”
Over the past few months, we’ve seen a steady increase in people coming into our offices for events, customer meetings, and team workshops. Today, 88 of our 110 global offices are open to employees, and we’ve found that Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the most popular days for employees to come in. 
Our offices are key to how we connect, but we also know that they are just one place where work gets done.
Our highest-attended offices over the past several months have been London, New York, Paris, San Francisco, Sydney, and Tokyo — key hubs in which employees live and work. Salesforce thrives in city centers around the globe where we can get together, embrace all that downtown areas have to offer, and be active members of our communities.
We continue to expand our real estate portfolio with plans to open Salesforce Towers in Tokyo, Dublin, Sydney, and Chicago over the next two years. And today, we’re thrilled to open Salesforce Tower Atlanta’s ‘Ohana Floor — a fully open, flexible space on the highest floor of the building where employees, customers, partners, and the community can connect and collaborate. 
Our offices are key to how we connect, but we also know that they are just one place where work gets done. We’re also experimenting with bold new ways to bring people together safely, including Trailblazer Ranch, a new gathering place nestled in the redwoods of Scotts Valley, Calif. There, employees can forge trusted relationships, learn, get inspired, grow in their careers, and give back to the community. And we’re exploring ways to bring these kinds of experiences to our hubs around the world.

Designing for a “flex” workstyle
Our dedicated design team continues to evolve our design standard while reflecting the needs of today’s changing, more flexible environment.
Individual desks will still have a role, but we’re prioritizing more breakout and collaboration spaces. We’re increasing our social space from 40% to 60% — adding more booths, cafes, communal tables, focus pods, and mobile audiovisual equipment to enhance the connection, camaraderie, and innovation that comes from gathering in person.
We are future-proofing our design with a flexible layout so we can adjust as we go.

A sustainable physical environment 
Sustainability is one of our core values at Salesforce, and more than 75% of employees say that healthy and sustainable materials are of high importance when coming back to the office. 
Salesforce is committed to integrating green and healthy building practices into our real estate strategy while keeping those who come into our spaces safe. We build all our spaces to LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environment Design) Gold- or Platinum-certified standards and meet ASHRAE (American Society of Heating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) standards for proper fresh air ventilation. 
As part of our comprehensive Healthy and Sustainable Materials Program, we’ve been measuring indoor air quality through professional testing and continuous monitoring. We’ve also increased our indoor air quality (IAQ) monitoring efforts and achieved our first Fitwel VRM certification, the world’s leading certification system for buildings and communities that optimize projects to support health. And we’re instituting a full HVAC system plan in all possible office locations to ensure optimal air quality.
Salesforce Tower in San Francisco is our most sustainable building yet and a roadmap for how we build spaces around the world. It holds the largest on-site water recycling system, called a blackwater system, in a commercial high-rise building in the United States, which will reduce the building’s water consumption by 76%.
We’ll continue to observe what works, listen to our employees’ feedback, and try new approaches as we go. As Salesforce grows, our offices will remain an essential pillar of how we come together to connect and collaborate.

30,"February 17, 2022","Salesforce and AWS Deliver Offering That Helps Content Distributors Easily Deploy, Scale and Personalize High-Quality Video Streaming Subscriptions","
Today, Salesforce and Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced an offering that combines high quality video streaming technology with unique viewer data and feedback analysis tools to help content distributors deliver more scalable, personalized viewer experiences.



“Attracting and retaining a diverse audience while delivering consistent, high-quality video is one of the key challenges content distributors face today. The Salesforce and AWS relationship brings together a comprehensive, industry-specific media offering designed for direct-to-consumer video and live streaming services. This allows content distributors to enhance their capabilities while also helping them rapidly launch new service offerings, such as subscription packages and product bundles,” said Christopher Dean, VP and GM, Media & Entertainment & Media Cloud, Salesforce. “Together, we’re providing a customizable set of scalable and easy-to-deploy content tools and AI-driven subscriber journeys to further help studios, streamers, publications, and other distributors quench consumers’ thirst for personalized content.”

Direct-to-consumer video subscription offering from Salesforce and AWS offers unique benefits to content distributors
The global offering is powered by Salesforce Customer 360 and Media Cloud subscriber lifecycle management capabilities, including artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled personalization, customer data and analytics, and AWS’ media, data, analytics, AI, and machine learning capabilities. 
The technology streamlines how the subscriber journey is managed from registration to new service features; provides content monetization, payments, and entitlements; supports the delivery of more dynamic, targeted ads; and improves customer interactions and campaigns to reduce customer churn. The benefits to content distributors include:
More Integrated, Personalized Experiences: Content distributors can personalize viewer experiences while driving new subscriber acquisition, generating incremental revenues while increasing customer loyalty, retention and support. For example, a subscription streaming service can recommend upcoming pay-per-view content, such as a professional car racing championship special for a car-loving subscriber, while integrating new content delivery models — like live streaming — on top of existing subscription services.Increased Retention with Additional Insight into Viewer Intelligence: Content distributors can gain deeper insight into subscriber engagement with content such as clickstream actions or likes and dislikes on specific content recommendations served up to a subscriber. Access to these insights help personalize marketing campaigns to the customer, ultimately helping to convert them to longer-term subscribers. For example, if a fitness video service notices that a subscriber’s engagement is beginning to fade, it can offer classes from that subscriber’s favorite instructor to initiate new engagement.Configurable Platform to Easily Support Commerce-Driven Experiences: Content distributors can easily customize the experience, such as introducing and scaling content-driven commerce experiences and targeted ad placements. For example, a brand can do product placement in a video stream, enabling the viewer to purchase that product at the same time they’re watching a video.

Open Image ModalCustomer interactions captured in Salesforce CDP help to drive personalization. AWS keeps a user engaged through personalized content while Salesforce delivers personalized subscriber journeys with marketing activations, omnichannel service, and special offers driving loyalty and retention.

“As development continues, Salesforce will continue to work with AWS and inspire the industry to consider deeper integration between the subscriber lifecycle and D2C video delivery, identifying and engaging audiences to make monetization simpler and more cost effective,” said Dean.
Top leaders in media and entertainment are using AWS and Salesforce to build innovative offerings 
Salesforce and AWS technologies are already helping drive innovation and transformation at some of the world’s most recognized brands – including NBC Universal – to increase customer loyalty and engagement and reduce D2C streaming service ownership costs. 
This combined offering will enable content distributors of all shapes and sizes to build innovative, scalable, and profitable offerings for audiences to help meet consumer demand for content.

31,"February 16, 2022",Salesforce Establishes Sustainability as a Core Company Value; Launches Net Zero Cloud 2.0 Globally,"

Salesforce further operationalizes sustainability throughout company; every employee and department now accountable to sustainability as a value 
In the new era of climate accountability, companies will need trusted emissions data to accelerate their journeys to net zero emissions
Net Zero Cloud 2.0 now available globally to help organizations like Mastercard, Deloitte Germany, Uhuru, and MillerKnoll reach their climate goals
Our planet needs everyone – governments, scientists, investors, businesses, and ecopreneurs – to take bold climate action today. 
Today, Salesforce officially announced sustainability as a core company value, joining its values of trust, customer success, innovation, and equality. And, to help organizations accelerate their own journeys to net zero emissions, Salesforce is also making Net Zero Cloud 2.0 — a solution that tracks greenhouse gas emissions — available globally.
“I’m extremely proud that we will now officially count sustainability as a core value, making it part of everyone’s job at Salesforce,” said Suzanne DiBianca, Chief Impact Officer & EVP of Corporate Relations, Salesforce. “When we add a value we operationalize it in every area of the business. In this climate emergency, we need every organization to get to net zero as fast as possible. Now that Salesforce has reached net zero emissions, we want to use our technology and best practices to help organizations reach their climate goals, too.”

Salesforce further integrates sustainability throughout company 
At Salesforce, values drive the company’s decision-making. Every employee and team knows Salesforce’s values and strives to live by them every day. 
With sustainability as a core value, Salesforce is leveraging its full power to drive climate action and further operationalize sustainability across its entire business. This means every internal organization incorporating sustainability into its V2MOM  — a Salesforce alignment process that drives the company’s success.
Salesforce today has net zero emissions and has been voluntarily reporting on its greenhouse gas emissions since fiscal year 2012. Since that time, the company has continued to increase the scope of its climate action strategy by actively engaging policymakers, peers, partners, suppliers, and customers to accelerate towards a collective net zero goal. And just last week, Salesforce announced that it is tying executive pay to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance, including two sustainability metrics. 
Mandatory climate reporting is coming
Regulatory change may soon require organizations to report on ESG matters, and many countries are already disclosing their climate-related financial risks and opportunities.
Legislatures and regulatory agencies in the United States are also considering disclosure rules. A bill that would require companies to disclose all greenhouse gas emissions is moving through the California legislature; and the U.S. SEC has solicited public input on voluntary climate change disclosures.
The next generation of Net Zero Cloud
In this new era of climate accountability, organizations’ carbon data will need to be as trusted as their financial data. Organizations will also need to know how to reduce emissions in a credible and meaningful way.


Net Zero Cloud 2.0 enables organizations to get sustainability insights with Tableau CRM dashboards

Customers and partners are implementing Net Zero Cloud
Global companies across industries are already using Net Zero Cloud to reach their climate goals:
Mastercard (Global): Mastercard, a global technology company in the payments industry, is using Net Zero Cloud, with support from Accenture, to gain comprehensive insights around the emissions of its suppliers, enabling it to work more effectively with its partner network to take climate action.ISDI (France): ISDI, the world’s first digital business school, is using Net Zero Cloud to calculate the carbon footprint of each visitor to its Paris center based on the types of transportation used, length of hotel stay, and energy use onsite – made possible by strategic support from Accenture. Deloitte Germany (Germany): As one of the top companies for corporate travel, Deloitte Germany’s clients have been challenging them on the transparency of their carbon footprint and in some cases it is a deciding factor for winning business. With Net Zero Cloud, Deloitte Germany can track its carbon emissions on a project by project basis allowing clients and employees to have insight into the carbon cost of business.Uhuru (Japan): As a top digital transformation consulting services company, Uhuru is using Net Zero Cloud to track scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions to educate its employees about decarbonization and eventually enable them to use this knowledge to help clients with their sustainability mission. MillerKnoll (USA): MillerKnoll, a global leader in designs and furnishings, is using Net Zero Cloud with support from Salesforce consulting partner Orion Global Solutions to see its supplier environmental impact in one singular view. Its annual emissions report used to take hundreds of hours across 20 spreadsheets. Now, MillerKnoll knows where they stand relative to their goal at any time.
Salesforce’s consulting partners including Accenture, KPMG, Orion Global Solutions, PwC, Slalom, and Traction on Demand are actively implementing Net Zero Cloud for customers across industries. In addition, these partners provide advisory services to drive the digital transformation required for customers to accelerate their journeys to becoming net zero companies.

32,"February 10, 2022",Introducing Trailblazer Ranch: Igniting the Next Chapter of Salesforce’s Culture,"

The past two years have challenged us to reimagine not only how we work, but also how we connect — and what it means to build a culture in an all-digital, work-from-anywhere world.
Having flexibility in where, when and how we work has made many of us simultaneously more productive and balanced. It has allowed parents to see more of their kids, recent graduates to live in affordable cities, and individuals to make more time for wellbeing. What started as a public health necessity has become an opportunity for employers and employees.
We know that flexible is the way forward. But we also know we need to align our company to our culture and safely get together, in person. Since the pandemic began, we’ve onboarded tens of thousands of employees remotely. Those employees have never met their manager or their teams in person. And many of our existing employees haven’t seen their colleagues face-to-face in two years. Finding ways to connect is the number one thing Salesforce employees asked for in our last employee survey. We need to bring back the spontaneity and joy that comes from being together in person, now.
Enter Trailblazer Ranch.



Trailblazer Ranch — igniting our culture for our next chapter
Culture is our greatest competitive advantage — it engages our people, drives the creation of our innovative products, and ultimately, helps our customers succeed.
With Trailblazer Ranch, we’re igniting our culture for our next chapter. We’re reimagining how and where we connect for the new world we’re in. Our physical spaces serve a different purpose today than they did two years ago. An essential part of our Success From Anywhere strategy is finding ways to empower our teams to come together and connect safely — and creating spaces that cultivate a sense of connection, collaboration, and joy.
Trailblazer Ranch is an exciting new gathering place where employees can forge trusted relationships with their colleagues, learn from one another, get inspired, grow in their career, get trained on the company, and give back to the community in a fun and safe environment. It is a place where we can share and strengthen the Salesforce culture, which is built around our values.
While we solidify our long-term Trailblazer Ranch site, our interim Trailblazer Ranch is a partnership with 1440 Multiversity, located in 75 acres in the beautiful Redwoods of Scotts Valley, California. We’ll collaborate with 1440 Multiversity to develop employee engagement programs, applying our joint research and learnings to future programs. Starting in March, we will host onboarding, trainings, skills building and talent development, bringing our employees together to connect in person.
This partnership will allow us to bring a Ranch-like experience to many of our employees now. At the same time, it’s important for all of our employees to experience the connection that will come from Trailblazer Ranch. So we’re exploring different ways to bring the Ranch to our Trailblazers around the world.

Disconnecting from technology and connecting with each other
After years of being on Zoom calls and staring at computer screens, we’re encouraging our employees to step away from their screens. According to a recent Deloitte study, employees are working three more hours a day compared to before the pandemic, and 80% of respondents ranked wellbeing as important or very important to their organization’s success. Trailblazer Ranch is an opportunity to disconnect from technology and connect with each other.
From the moment guests step foot on the Ranch, they’ll become immersed in Salesforce’s culture. They’ll have the opportunity to participate in tactile experiences like guided nature walks, restorative yoga, garden tours, group cooking classes, art journaling, and meditation. Learning, planning and team-building are important to the Trailblazer Ranch experience, but we can accomplish this in a whole new way — surrounded by nature, with wellbeing, giving back and fun at the center.
It’s not enough to create better experiences for employees — we want to extend the space to the community. As we’ve done with our ‘Ohana Floors in our Salesforce Towers around the world, we will open Trailblazer Ranch to local nonprofits and the community.
This is just the first phase of our Trailblazer Ranch journey. We look forward to creating meaningful connections and experiences with our Trailblazers around the world.

33,"February 10, 2022",Our 2022 Annual Equality Update: Accelerating Representation and Racial Equality,"

Editor’s note: Data is based on 2021 operations for Salesforce (fiscal year February 1, 2021 through January 31, 2022)
Our Next Chapter of Equality at Salesforce
During my time at Salesforce, I’ve been so inspired by the company’s commitment to Equality and all of the people in our extended community who have paved the way to get us where we are today. We learned, we stumbled, we took risks — always guided by our values. I am honored to be able to continue the work as the newly appointed Chief Equality Officer as we evolve into this next chapter. 
Over the last two years I’ve watched our company, industry, and world grapple with some of the most difficult moments in recent history. Not only were we faced with a global pandemic that radically shifted the way we work and live – we also were faced with the reality of social injustices, racism, and hate — all made more visible by the disproportionate impact of the health crisis. Companies were called to action, and we chose to lead with our values while redefining what equality truly means to us. 
During Black History Month, we reflect even more deeply on the historic events over the last two years and the long-standing history we still need to reconcile. We work together with our community to elevate Black Joy, Healing, and Justice while finding ways to support Black talent in the workplace. As a company, we center our focus on racial equality, justice, equity, inclusion, and most importantly, doing the work. 
Equality to us is about taking action toward becoming a workplace and world where everyone has equal access, opportunities, rights, and true justice. We recognize that involves focusing on equity, our systems, and community engagement. In this year’s lookback of our fiscal year, we’re sharing how this intentional focus has led to accelerated impact; and how we will continue to innovate and re-imagine this work as we grow.
Representation Matters and It’s About Hiring and Experience
Our aspiration is to create a workplace that looks like society and to do this we need to accelerate representation. In 2019, we set a goal to have 50% of our U.S. employees from underrepresented groups by 2023. We’ve now met that goal nearly a full year early. Today, 50.7% of our U.S. employees are members of underrepresented groups. 
As a company we have three additional public representation goals to continue to accelerate this work, and we’re evaluating new goals to help hold us accountable.

This year, we will also tie executive compensation to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals – including representation. This is an important step for us to build greater accountability, lead with our values, and accelerate our ESG initiatives.
Our Progress so Far
Over the last few years we’ve been deeply focused on re-imagining our hiring systems with equality at the center. We saw significant change thanks to new initiatives like: our diversity recruiting team, a more equitable referral process, and the Insiders program, which connects candidates to employees from their community. Underrepresented Minority (URM) overall, as well as Black and Latinx, hiring representation have all increased since last year. Notably Black representation in hiring has more than doubled since we first launched our programs in 2020. 

Open Image ModalIn the past year, Salesforce has seen progress in its commitment to hiring more Underrepresented minorities (URM) and Women globally. View full interactive data charts here.

We also introduced our new Hiring Certification requirement, which includes bias training and enabled inclusive hiring practices, for managers and recruiters. The goal is to reduce bias in the hiring process and open up access to underrepresented talent. Over 40,000 employees have participated in the hiring certification program to date.  
The progress we’ve seen in hiring has begun to accelerate representation.

Notably, connected to our focused racial equality efforts and hiring innovations — both our Black and Underrepresented Minority (URM) representation grew at nearly twice the pace as our previous annual averages. As of February 2022, Black representation is 4.8% (compared to 3.6% in Feb 2021) and URM representation is 13.6% (compared to 11.8% in Feb 2021). Not Pictured: U.S. Women and U.S. Asian VP+ representation increased from last year — up to 38.3% and 18.4% respectively. 
Areas of Opportunity
While we’ve made significant progress across underrepresented minority representation overall – there is still work to do for our VP+ population, with a particular focus on our Latinx community. 
We know that representation does not hinge on hiring alone — we must focus on experience. We continue to see higher attrition trends for underrepresented minorities as well as experience gaps in our employee survey data, particularly for Black women. This year we’re expanding and introducing new equity-focused strategies to shift experience and drive retention.
Changing the Experience
An employee’s experience is defined by the company culture, their leaders, and the talent systems that drive their careers. We know some people experience the world and workplace differently than others. We are working to be the most inclusive company possible where everyone feels supported, valued, included, and empowered to succeed. Here are some of the initiatives we’ve prioritized to help get there: 
Black Women Experience 
We’re continuing to focus on the experience of Black women in the workplace to address the unique, multi-layered, and intersectional challenges that often confront this community. Research shows, for example, Black women experience microaggressions more frequently and have less access to sponsors. We know when we solve for our marginalized communities, we solve for all. Informed by our employees, research and data insights, we’re taking steps to improve the experience of Black women. Our focus areas include creating access, embedding equality through enablement, innovating our talent processes, and accelerating representation.
As part of this initiative, we are launching a formal sponsorship program for Black women to connect with leaders who can advocate and invest in their career growth. We’ve also created tailored tool kits and opportunities for both Black women and managers to help remove barriers and advance careers. Last year, we launched an all-company training on how to identify and mitigate microaggressions in the workplace. And we’re continuing to enable our employees with inclusive hiring and promotion practices. We’re starting to see progress – Black women representation in hiring has doubled over the last two years.
Equality Mentorship & Sponsorship Programs 
Our Equality Mentorship program pairs employees of color with executive mentors to help navigate their careers. The program was founded by equality group leaders in BOLDforce and Asiapacforce to create more access for their communities to senior leaders and is now a core program managed by the Equality team. The program includes resources for mentees and mentors, and a continued learning path for our participants to turn mentors into career advocates and sponsors.

Equality Leadership Programs
We’ve expanded our Underrepresented Minority (URM) Leadership program in partnership with the Executive Leadership Council, and have doubled the participation rate and integrated participation as an input into our key talent processes. This year we piloted our Women’s leadership program and also introduced a new Asian leadership program to accelerate Asian representation in executive roles and increase access and opportunities.
Equality Enablement
To create a truly inclusive culture, we need to give our employees – especially managers —  the tools they need to recognize and address bias, foster belonging, create access, and advocate for others. Last year, in addition to our all-company hiring training, we introduced our microaggression training starting with our leaders. Knowing this can’t be a one-and-done experience, but rather a continuous journey, we also included microaggression and bias training in all of our core talent processes. 
We continue to enable our employees with tailored trainings, including: Racial Equality Ally,  Inclusive Language, Inclusive Promotions, and Inclusive Marketing practices. 
Warmline 
The Warmline is an employee advocacy program for women of all races and ethnicities as well as Black, Indigeneous, Latinx, and LGBTQ+ employees. It connects employees with advocates who help them navigate career moments, issues of belonging, and courageous conversations. 
Equality Groups
Our equality groups are at the heart of our culture. They provide our underrepresented employees with community, safety, and support. They also help build allyship and connection across our company. We recognize the incredible value and commitments of this work. These employees are leading Equality from the front lines as volunteers. That’s why we continue to offer recognition, as well as compensation for globally elected Equality Group leaders. 
The last year was incredibly difficult for some of the communities represented by these groups. The Equality team worked closely with the leaders to provide space to process, grieve, learn, and support those impacted through what we call ‘Equality Circles’.

Gender Inclusive Benefits 
Our equality groups often help inform and guide us to ensure we are being inclusive of all our communities. Belonging is about being able to show up as who you truly are without fear or barriers. Last year, after listening to our LGBTQ+ community and consulting with Outforce, we went to work on a set of safe and accessible new benefits to support the unique needs of our global transgender and non-binary community. This included gender affirmation medical reimbursement, gender affirmation leave, wardrobe reimbursement, legal fee reimbursement, counseling services, and more. Learn more here. 
Continued Action on Racial Equality and Justice 
This month, our equality group for Black employees and their allies — BOLDforce — is elevating Black Joy, Healing, and Justice. This is especially important given the backdrop of the events of the last two years. 
In 2020, we formed the Racial Equality and Justice Task force, inclusive of BOLDforce leadership and our most senior leaders, to support the Black community and take action against racism and hate. Last year, with the rise of anti-Asian violence, we took action to add new commitments to support the AAPI community.
It is important that work continues with the same energy we started and that it evolves as we do. The task force takes actions across four P’s: People, Purchasing, Philanthropy, and Policy. We’ve already shared some of the integrated results of our People strategies this year. Here’s the progress across our other three pillars to date:  
Purchasing

Salesforce programs that support Black-owned businesses include mentoring, accelerated pay programming, and more.

We’re continuing to work toward our goal of spending $100 million with Black-owned businesses by 2023 and have increased our spend with minority-owned businesses by 50%.
Through Salesforce Ventures, we are committed to increasing our overall number of Black and URM founders by more than 3x by 2023, and have already invested more than $100 million in Black and URM-led companies since the launch of the Taskforce.
We’ve introduced a number of new programs to deepen our investment and support for minority-owned businesses:
We launched our 12-month Black-Owned Business Mentor Program, providing sponsorship, education, and networking opportunities to 25 Black-owned businesses. We formalized an accelerated pay program to offer verified small business suppliers — which includes many diverse businesses owned by racial minorities, women, veterans, LGBTQ+, and people with disabilities —a shortened net 15 days payment term. More than 450 suppliers have signed up to receive this accelerated payment option.We supported the National Minority Supplier Development Council CRM License Initiative, offering CRM licenses and support to more than 100 small and minority-owned businesses.
Philanthropy

Racial equality and justice are central to Salesforce’s philanthropic endeavors, including pro bono services and thousands of employee volunteer hours.

We support organizations driving long-term change for communities of color. We intend to donate $200 million and 1 million volunteer hours toward organizations focused on racial equality and justice over five years.
Since June 2020, we have donated over $82 million to advance racial equality and justice, putting us 41% of the way toward our five-year donation goal.Since June 2020, we have delivered over 223,000 racial equality and justice-related employee volunteer hours, and over the past year, we delivered $1.6M in pro bono services aligned to Sustainable Development Goal 10, Reduced Inequalities. Tableau Foundation released the Do No Harm Guide in partnership with the Urban Institute, which helps people collect and present data through a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive lens. The Guide is part of the Tableau Foundation’s Racial Equity Data Hub.
Policy

Salesforce continues to support meaningful policy reform, especially working toward voting reform.

Salesforce’s Government Affairs team continued the advocacy work we began in 2020, focusing on police reform, criminal justice reform, and the protection and expansion of voting rights in the United States. 
In 2021, Government Affairs analyzed and tracked over 275 pieces of legislation that aligned with our policy priorities, directly advocating for more than 20 pieces of legislation and engaging with more than a dozen U.S. Congressional offices on police and criminal justice reform.Opposed specific provisions of voting reforms in Georgia and Texas that were not aligned with our policy principles, and supported voting rights legislation in Washington State.Supported the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act (VRAA) through direct advocacy, earned media, and as a member of the Business for Voting Rights coalition.
Elevating Our Stories and Taking Action Together 
We are not alone in this work — we are working together with our partners, our customers, our ecosystem, our industry, and our greater communities to drive equality for everyone. We continue to look for ways to use our platforms to elevate underrepresented and underheard voices and have conversations about the work we can all do to drive change. Last year, we hosted our fourth annual racial equality summit, Representation Matters, our third annual gender equality summit Trailblazing Women, discussed topics like Black healing and wellness with Minda Harts, and partnered with our community to share resources on ways to take action to address racism and hate. Together we can advocate for others, open doors, change systems, and create a more equal and just world.

34,"February 10, 2022",Driving Greater Accountability with New ESG Measures,"

Part of what makes Salesforce an amazing company is our belief that business is the greatest platform for change. Our commitment to equality and sustainability helps us be a better company — and foster more inclusive, equitable, and resilient communities.
In order to build greater accountability and accelerate our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives, we will include ESG goals as part of our executive compensation programs. Going forward, a portion of executive variable pay for Executive Vice President and above will be determined by four ESG measures. For this fiscal year, the measures will focus on equality and sustainability.
The equality measures will focus on increasing representation of Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and multiracial employees in the U.S., and of women employees globally.The sustainability measures will focus on reducing air travel emissions, as well as increasing spend with suppliers who have signed Salesforce’s Sustainability Exhibit, a procurement contract with the goal of reducing our collective carbon footprint and helping our suppliers set and meet climate targets.
This new initiative will help us continue to drive meaningful results this year, and accelerate our progress on these important issues.

37,"February 3, 2022",Salesforce Introduces Innovations for Manufacturing Cloud to Automate Service Processes,"

Salesforce today announced Manufacturing Cloud for Service, a new, industry-specific platform built on Service Cloud. 
Why it’s relevant: With Manufacturing Cloud for Service, manufacturers can take advantage of Service Cloud’s ability to deliver smarter, faster, and more personalized service across any channel or device to grow customer loyalty and satisfaction, replacing the various legacy customer service tools that make it difficult for service teams to quickly access data.
Built with manufacturers’ needs in mind, the platform also comes with manufacturing-specific innovations. It quickly connects to a company’s Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platform and contains prebuilt processes and a data model to allow customer service, field technicians, and product teams to effectively manage customer service cases.
Driving the news: Manufacturers are increasingly managing customers who expect 24/7, omnichannel digital service experiences. What’s more, Salesforce’s recent Trends in Manufacturing Report found that 56% of surveyed manufacturers consider pandemic-induced changes to their customer service capabilities to be permanent. 
These manufacturers are looking for ways to strengthen customer loyalty while also automating customer service and turning it from a cost enter into a revenue generator.

Details: Manufacturing Cloud for Service builds upon Salesforce’s early commitment to the manufacturing space with a complete platform that can handle all of a company’s customer-centric operations – from sales to service — helping drive revenue. Key features include: 
Automated service processes drive efficiency: Customers can create automated workflows across the manufacturing ecosystem with Digital Process Automation, powered by OmniStudio, to resolve cases fast and power process automation with contextual information from disparate sources. This allows a manufacturing customer to initiate an application or claim from a customer portal and receive automated, guided engagement as they fill out a form. On the operations side, customer service representatives and other support teams can then pick up the case and evaluate it alongside data from an ERP platform or other sources to quickly close the claim out. Service parts forecasting tool improves predictions: The new tool offers a forecasting framework to capture a holistic view of predicted volumes and demand, including installed base and service consumption. Customer service data – from work orders to warranty claims – are analyzed to inform part plans. Voice of the customer, elevated: Using native Salesforce surveys, manufacturers can now capture feedback directly from customers at every stage of the relationship and leverage the insights to refine customer experiences and product strategies.

The Salesforce perspective: “As the manufacturing industry contends with supply chain delays, there are increased expectations from customers for personalized service and asset uptime,” said Achyut Jajoo, SVP and GM of Manufacturing and Automotive, Salesforce. “With Manufacturing Cloud for Service, manufacturers can pull in customer, order, product, and asset performance data and insights to deliver differentiated customer experiences, boost brand loyalty, and enhance customer relationships.”
The industry perspective: “With the help of Manufacturing Cloud for Service, we will be able to deliver services much faster to our customers, and we can make sure that asset downtime is as minimal as it can be,” said Thomas Göcke Head of Digital Business Transformation for Koenig & Bauer. “That, in turn, helps our customers be more productive and more successful in the marketplace.”

38,"February 2, 2022",Salesforce and JetBlue Build on Partnership to Accelerate Their Shared Journey Toward Sustainable Air Travel,"
JetBlue becomes the first airline to leverage Salesforce Net Zero Cloud to track emissions on its journey to Net Zero
Salesforce has also joined JetBlue’s Sustainable Travel Partners program to accelerate the sustainability of its employees business travel
JetBlue and Salesforce today announced a new partnership that will leverage travel data and technology to help bring air travel into a Net Zero future.
As the first airline to leverage Salesforce Net Zero Cloud, JetBlue, a global, award-winning travel company, will gain comprehensive insights into its emissions on the path to achieve Net Zero across its full value chain. To further build on this collaboration, Salesforce has joined JetBlue’s Sustainable Travel Partners program, announced earlier this year, as an inaugural customer. The newly-launched program includes a suite of offerings to help corporate travel customers reduce their business travel emissions and meet corporate sustainability targets. 
To reduce its impact on the planet, Salesforce will also help compensate for its business travel emissions through the purchase of Sustainable Aviation Fuel certificates from JetBlue.  
“The future of transformative climate action lies within the trusted customer-supplier relationship,” said Ari Alexander, VP and GM, Salesforce Net Zero Cloud. “We are thrilled that JetBlue is leveraging Salesforce Net Zero Cloud to prioritize data-driven climate action and proud to be a part of JetBlue’s Sustainable Travel Partners program to help accelerate the journey toward sustainable air travel.” 
JetBlue becomes first airline to use Salesforce Net Zero Cloud for emissions tracking
Following the implementation of Net Zero Cloud, JetBlue will make travel emissions data available to the airline’s Sustainable Travel Partners. Net Zero Cloud allows businesses to quickly track, analyze, and report reliable environmental data and take actions to achieve carbon neutrality.
Accessing real-time, granular, and insightful emissions data has historically been a pain point as we track and work toward our decarbonization targets. We are excited by the prospect of quickly compiling accurate and up-to-date emissions data in an easy-to-use format through the use of Net Zero Cloud.Sara Bogdan, Director of Sustainability and Environmental Social Governance, JetBlue

Bogdan continued, “We’re excited for Net Zero Cloud to not only help us strategize and plan for our own 2040 Net Zero target, but to also help us share that data with our Sustainable Travel Partners, providing first-of-its-kind emissions reporting based on each corporate travelers’ actual JetBlue flights. As the world comes together to reduce our collective environmental impact, collaborations like these with Salesforce are vital as we share expertise in pursuit of shared goals.”

Salesforce joins JetBlue program to help decarbonize business travel
As part of its Climate Action Plan, Salesforce has set a goal of maintaining employee business travel emissions intensity below 50% of its FY20 baseline. 
As a Sustainable Travel Partner program member, Salesforce, along with other inaugural customers, worked toward this goal by sourcing 325,000 gallons of Sustainable Aviation Fuel in 2021. 
This strategy is promising. Leading U.S. airlines have pledged to work with government leaders and other stakeholders to make available 3 billion gallons of cost-competitive Sustainable Aviation Fuel in 2030. These purchases will help stimulate a market for lower carbon-emitting biofuel alternatives to traditional jet fuel. 
Optimizing data and technology for sustainable employee business travel
The JetBlue Sustainable Travel Partners program will provide Salesforce with personalized, company-specific emissions data and actionable insights to help drive employee engagement, education, and behavior change at scale. 
This builds upon Salesforce’s current efforts, which include an optimized employee travel booking tool that recommends lowest-emission modes of travel. This enables easy mode-switching on routes where a more sustainable form of transportation is a viable alternative, such as traveling by rail instead of air.
Meaningful climate action will require broad collaboration
Salesforce is also engaging with its travel suppliers to encourage them to set science-based targets and provide Salesforce with carbon neutral products and services through the company’s Sustainability Exhibit, which embeds sustainability into all of Salesforce’s supplier contracts.
In 2021, Salesforce also joined the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance to help accelerate investment in high-quality Sustainable Aviation Fuel, and the First Movers Coalition with a commitment to replace 5% of Salesforce’s conventional jet fuel demand with low or no-carbon alternatives.

39,"February 1, 2022",Salesforce Launches Safety Cloud to Help Businesses and Communities Get Together Safely,"

Safety Cloud streamlines COVID-19 testing and health status reporting with agility and security on a single platform 
New integrations with COVID-19 testing partners — including CVS Health®, eMed, Cue Health, and ixlayer — as well as SMART Health Card support, lets customers automate and report on COVID-19 health status at scale
SAN FRANCISCO — February 1, 2022 — Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), the global leader in CRM, today announced Safety Cloud to help people get together safely. Building on Salesforce’s own event and workplace experience — and expanding on existing health and safety innovations announced in December — Safety Cloud helps businesses and communities better manage testing, health and entry protocols to create safer in-person experiences at events and in the workplace.
Data shows that getting people together safely and in-person is imperative to building and maintaining culture, employee retention and satisfaction, and business growth.
In a recent Salesforce employee survey, 77% of employees said they want to get together in-person with their teamsAccording to the American Express Meetings & Events Global Forecast, 81% of meeting and event professionals expect their events in 2022 to have an in-person elementA Harvard Business Review survey shows that, while hybrid work may be here to stay, there is an emerging consensus among business owners and employees that they are looking to be back in the office three days per week, on average.
“Businesses around the globe are looking for the best ways for their employees, customers and partners to get together, safely,” said Bret Taylor, Co-CEO of Salesforce. “Testing is the path forward and Safety Cloud enables organizations of all types to take the complexity out of events, and bring people together again with confidence.”
Testing is the path forward and Safety Cloud enables organization of all types to take the complexity out of events, and bring people together again with confidence.Bret Taylor, Co-CEO, Salesforce
Nearly two years into the pandemic, businesses and communities continue to grapple with flexibly scaling their health verification initiatives to handle the ever-changing COVID-19 landscape without affecting business operations. Testing is a critical aspect of how people safely get together, so to address this need, a robust platform to manage testing capabilities at scale is critical. 
Safety Cloud enables organizations to safely operate in a new normal. In fact, Salesforce has now used different features from Safety Cloud to reopen 84 of its offices globally and host two large-scale company events, helping employees, customers, and partners feel safer. For Dreamforce SF and NYC 2021 alone, Salesforce facilitated more than 21,500 COVID-19 tests and verified more than 8,000 vaccine credentials, helping more than 4,500 attendees get together safely.


Safety Cloud helps businesses and communities better manage their testing, health and entry protocols to create safer in-person experiences at events and in the workplace.
Helping businesses and communities get together safely
Safety Cloud supports integrations with at-home, pharmacy and on-site testing options, including CVS Health®, eMed, Cue Health, ixlayer, and Senneca DX. These supported testing options can be connected directly to Safety Cloud, making the testing experience easier than ever. In addition, Safety Cloud will support SMART Health Cards and EU Digital COVID Certificates, which are paper or digital versions of clinical information, such as vaccination history or test results.

In addition, Safety Cloud will enable customers to:
Streamline COVID-19 testing and health status reporting with agility and security across one platform. For example, if first responders test positive through an integrated testing platform, they no longer need to visit a physical location to verify their health status in-person to get approval for paid leave. Test results are automatically loaded into the platform, enabling organizations to better track the availability of critical workers to ensure adequate staffing is in place.Build flexible, scalable protocols to bring people back together safely at events with evolving COVID-19 health and safety protocols, including testing and vaccine status requirements, identity and registration, and personalized communication journeys as public health guidelines change. For example, a business hosting a large-scale customer event can define and automate attendee testing protocols — including sending personalized emails about testing requirements and deadlines — ultimately helping to identify positive COVID-19 cases before the event even begins.Automate workplace entry and combine identification and health status into a Dreampass — a secure, multifactor pass for validated access. For example, an HR team focused on getting its employees and contractors back to the workplace safely can now automate entry into a building with a secure digital pass once a negative COVID-19 test result is detected.

40,"January 27, 2022","Salesforce Launches Global Digital Skills Index: In-Depth Insights from 23,000 Workers","

Quick take: Salesforce’s 2022 Global Digital Skills Index reveals a growing digital skills crisis. This article takes an in-depth look at the findings, based on what 23,000+ workers across 19 countries say about digital skills, including their impact on the future of work, concerns about job readiness, and the significance of continuous learning. 

It’s the Digital Age. Or is it? A majority of the current and prospective workforce think they lack the proper digital skills to prepare them for the future. 
Across 19 surveyed countries, workers scored 33 out of a possible 100 points on the Digital Skills Readiness Index across areas such as preparedness, access to learning resources, skill level, and participation in training. Workers in the United States fared slightly better at 36 out of 100 points.

It’s a common assumption that developed countries and younger generations feel more prepared for the digital skills demanded by today’s jobs. But these findings challenge those assumptions. In fact, many respondents say they feel unequipped and unprepared for some of the most important digital skills needed for the workplace. 




			What are digital skills?

Nearly three out of four respondents worldwide say they aren’t equipped with the resources needed to learn the digital skills they need to succeed in the current and future workforce. Confidence also dips dramatically in countries like Italy and South Korea, whose respondents are less active in learning and training, and have poorer access to skilling resources. 
Three major skills gaps identified in new global index
1. The everyday skills gap
The vast majority of respondents (83%) claim “advanced” or “intermediate” everyday social media skills and 76% say the same for everyday digital communication skills. However, only one-third feel prepared for the workplace social media skills needed over the next five years. 
Two-thirds of respondents say they’re unprepared for social media skills that the workplace will require over the next five years.
Over 6 in 10  global respondents say skills in collaboration technology like Slack are viewed as the most important skills needed by businesses today and over the next five years. Despite respondents’ prowess with everyday collaboration technology like social media and digital communication, only 25% rated themselves “advanced” in collaboration technology skills needed specifically for the workplace.
2. The generational skills gap
Only 31% of Gen Z respondents, the first truly digital native generation, feel “very equipped” for a digital-first job right now. Not many Gen Z respondents believe they have “advanced” digital skills in areas like coding (20%), data encryption & cybersecurity (18%), and AI (7%). 
Other generations report an even steeper challenge. 
Just 17% of Baby Boomers believe they are “very equipped now” for digital-first employment.
3. The leadership and workforce skills gap
When it comes to digital skills readiness and education, senior leadership and their workforce aren’t on the same page. 
A majority of senior leadership respondents (54%) said they are prepared with the digital skills necessary now. However, less than half of managers and individual contributors agree, signaling a disconnect within organizations. 



			Digital skills are our future

The skills gap impacts global GDP
A recent Salesforce-commissioned RAND Europe Report highlights that the digital skills gap comes at a cost. It estimated that 14 G20 countries could miss out on $11.5 trillion cumulative GDP growth if the skills gap isn’t addressed. This comes as emerging technologies such as blockchain, AI, and the cloud are amplifying business’ demand for specific digital skills — by up to 50% in Europe and the United States (McKinsey). 
Despite this finding, 64% of Salesforce’s global index respondents rated themselves as “beginners” in AI digital skills. A mere 17% of global survey respondents consider themselves “advanced” in workplace digital skills and roughly half rate themselves as “beginners,” illustrating the need to close the gap across the board. 
View a full breakdown of how respondents rate their workplace digital skill level in Tableau. 




Businesses have a critical role to play in closing the skills gap
The pandemic has accelerated digital transformation and given businesses a unique opportunity to rethink how they connect with their employees, customers, and communities. 
The majority of respondents (82%) plan to learn new skills to help them grow in their current career or a new career. Some ways that businesses, governments, and communities can work together in supporting the workforce’s thirst for knowledge include: harnessing existing learning communities, investing in younger generations, and promoting training programs focused on top digital skills.
Harness learning communities
Over half of respondents (51%) want to learn new skills to help them grow in their current career over new or different career paths. Where digital education, training, and job creation is concerned, business leaders don’t need to start entirely from scratch. By harnessing the potential and motivation of current employees to innovate, they can accelerate progress towards closing the skills gap. 
Salesforce’s Trailblazer Community is one example of the role that a community can play in helping people learn new skills and expand their networks. The Trailblazer Community is a network of 15 million people across the Salesforce ecosystem who help each other learn new skills and succeed with Salesforce, offering an online platform to learn and connect from anywhere. 
Invest in younger generations
Younger generations have more confidence and ambition to learn skills they don’t know as well – across the globe, 36% of Gen Z and Millennials are “very actively” participating in learning and training, compared to only 22% of Gen X and 15% of Baby Boomers.
Promote training programs focused on top digital skills
Respondents ranked these five digital skills as being most critical for businesses to invest in over the next five years: 

Many of these in-demand workplace skills — from collaboration tech to cyber security — aren’t found in typical school curriculum, reiterating the need for recruiters to focus less on established education programs and more on the “real world” digital skills.
The survey revealed remaining skill gaps in some of these critical areas:
While the index reveals that collaboration technology skills has the biggest percentage of “advanced” practitioners, this still only equates to roughly 25% of survey respondents.Despite 58% saying encryption & cybersecurity skills are particularly important, only 14% report “advanced” knowledge of the subject.Nearly half of all respondents view digital sustainability skills as important “now and in the next five years.” Even among business owners, only 16% say they have “advanced” digital skills for operating technology that promotes sustainable business activities like tracing, measuring, and analyzing climate data within an organization. 
A newly digital-first world presents a major opportunity for companies to rethink what agile teams look like. By building training programs based on what workers believe will make them most successful in the workplace, companies can create a flexible working culture that empowers all employees to connect, learn, and progress from anywhere.

41,"January 27, 2022",New Digital Skills Index from Salesforce Reveals 76% of Global Workers Say They Are Unequipped for the Future of Work,"

Over three-quarters of respondents do not feel ready to operate in a digital-first world, but only 28% are actively involved in digital skills learning and trainingThere is a major gap emerging between everyday digital skills and those needed for work, especially among younger workersUsing collaboration technologies is viewed as the most important digital workplace skill for workers over the next five years
San Francisco, January 27, 2022 – Salesforce, the global leader in CRM, today published its new Global Digital Skills Index, revealing a growing global digital skills crisis and an urgent need for action. The Salesforce Index is based on over 23,000 workers in 19 countries reporting their readiness to acquire key digital skills.
Nearly three-quarters of respondents (73%) don’t feel equipped to learn the digital skills needed by businesses now and even more (76%) don’t feel equipped for the future. Despite 82% of survey respondents planning to learn new skills in the next five years, only 28% are actively involved in digital skills learning and training programs now. 
The global digital skills gap
This gap is a concern – but it also presents an opportunity. With companies around the world rapidly transitioning to digital-first models, the demand for employees with digital skills has soared. 
The Salesforce Index’s overall global score for digital readiness, assessed in terms of preparedness, skill level, access, and active participation in digital upskilling, is currently only 33 out of 100. The countries represented in the survey ranged from scores of 63 to 15, highlighting that while certain countries feel more digitally ready than others, there is an urgent need for global investment to close the digital skills gap and build a more inclusive workforce.
Everyday digital skills don’t translate to the workplace
Everyday skills such as social media and web navigation don’t necessarily translate to the core workplace digital skills needed by business to drive recovery, resilience, and growth.
More than two thirds of all Gen Z respondents (64%) say they have advanced social media skills — supporting the stereotype of digital mastery among the younger generation — but less than a third (31%) believe they have the advanced digital workplace skills needed by businesses now.
Generational skills gap
However, the Salesforce Index also reveals that younger respondents have the greatest confidence and ambition to learn new skills — over one-third of Gen Z is actively learning and training for skills needed over the next five years compared to 12% of Baby Boomers. 
The most important digital skills needed by businesses today
According to the Salesforce Index, skills in collaboration technology are viewed as the most important digital workplace skill for workers today and over the next five years. But despite respondents’ prowess with everyday collaboration technology like social media, only 25% rate themselves advanced in those collaboration technology skills needed specifically for the workplace.

“There’s a gap between the frontier of innovation and the skills necessary to use those innovations,” said Peter Schwartz, SVP, Strategic Planning and Chief Futures Officer, Salesforce. “That in itself, is not new. But what is new, is the scope of that innovation, how widespread it is, how it has diffused in every aspect of life. It is hard to do almost anything these days without some form of digital interaction.”
“At Salesforce, we’ve made it our mission to empower anyone to learn and harness the digital-first skills needed for the jobs of today and tomorrow,” said Kris Lande, SVP, Marketing & Community, Salesforce. “We are building critical pathways to the new economy by enabling anyone to build a dynamic career, company, and community with Salesforce.”

42,"January 26, 2022",New Salesforce Maps Innovations Help Sales Teams Drive Revenue with Improved Flexibility and Efficiency,"

New Territory Planning  capabilities support field, digital, and hybrid selling models,  and factor in rep skill sets, seniority, and other capacity constraints
Today, Salesforce announced new Salesforce Maps Territory Planning innovations, making it easier for sales operations leaders to assess territory mapping needs, enhance selling models, and realign coverage based on multiple factors including role, location, and level of expertise.
For many companies, sales teams have typically been responsible for selling within territories where they live and work — and the process for designing those territories has been tedious and manual. Companies need to know how many sales reps they need, and where, to drive revenue growth. With the shift over the last two years away from in-person selling to more hybrid or fully digital engagements, it has become even more complicated to effectively design territories. 
“In today’s work-from-anywhere world, companies need a smart solution to ensure territories are balanced effectively — regardless of where their sales reps are located,” said Taksina Eammano, SVP, Product Management, Sales Cloud. “Salesforce Maps Territory Planning enables precision for sales leaders to drive maximum revenue growth from their sales team’s capacity.”
New Salesforce Maps Territory Planning innovations include:
Territory Planning for Digital Selling: Enables sales operations leaders to create territory planning models that flexibly support field, digital, and hybrid selling models. Within a single plan, companies can  specify whether a given territory should be contiguous or non-contiguous — allowing them to quickly and easily design equitable territories that match their sales process.
Territory Planning for Workload Variation: Sets sales teams up for success by factoring in rep skill sets, seniority, and other capacity constraints when balancing territories. With Territory Planning for Workload Variation, new hires get up to speed quickly and confidently, assigned to territories with reduced scope, while senior reps are assigned broader yet manageable scopes. 
Territory Planning for Team Selling: Empowers teams to plan related territories in order to foster team collaboration and continuity across different roles. Now, instead of designing territories from scratch, companies can visually overlay an existing territory plan on top of a new or proposed plan. For example, aligning a sales rep’s territory with a solution engineer’s territory improves collaboration and sales effectiveness. 
DocuSign Carves 3,000 Territories with Salesforce Maps
DocuSign, the Agreement Cloud company and Salesforce partner, uses Salesforce Maps Territory Planning’s advanced optimization engine to automatically carve 3,000 global territories for its sales reps – which would otherwise take hours, days, or even months to complete. Now DocuSign can summarize large and complex datasets in meaningful visualizations and share them across stakeholders, enabling leadership to make informed decisions and create equitable territories. The ability to create a territory by referencing an existing, related one will make their carving even more impactful. 
“The more our related sales roles can work together consistently, the more effective they become. The new Territory Planning functionality will help us accelerate our team selling motion, which means we’ll be better positioned to close more deals,” Grace Carter, Senior Manager of  GTM Strategy & Operations, DocuSign.
Availability
Territory Planning for Digital Selling and Territory Planning for Workload Variation are available globally today. Territory Planning for Team Selling will be available in February 2022.

Salesforce today announced a $1 million donation to The Partnership for Los Angeles Schools to advance equity in high-need schools throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD).
Founded as a nonprofit in 2007, The Partnership manages 19 historically under-resourced traditional public schools in LAUSD throughout Boyle Heights, South LA, and Watts. The Partnership serves as an in-district partner to LA Unified and will be able to deepen its impact to provide more than 13,000 students with a high-quality education with this donation.
“Now more than ever, schools need support,” said Ron Smith, VP of Strategic Giving, Salesforce. “Salesforce is building upon its longstanding commitment to education to help schools address growing inequities and get students — many of whom have faced incredible challenges to their learning during the pandemic — on track to succeed in college and beyond. We are thrilled to be supporting students and teachers in Los Angeles through this donation.”
Donation furthers Salesforce’s efforts toward education equity 
Salesforce believes an equitable future begins with equal access to a high-quality education. The cloud-based software leader has provided more than than $145 million in grants to schools and education nonprofits to date, supporting critical programs for education access and advancement, including racial equity. 
Since 2013, Salesforce has taken a regional approach to its equity goals, investing more than $100 million in the San Francisco and Oakland Unified School Districts, with additional funds directed towards Chicago, Indianapolis, and New York. Today’s news expands these efforts to Los Angeles, the second largest school system in the United States. 
The donation follows Salesforce’s announcement of a multi-year partnership with Team USA and the LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games. As a Founding Partner of the LA28 Games, Salesforce will play a key role in helping the group develop programs that address educational priorities in LA communities as part of the Games’ commitment to leaving a human legacy.

44,"January 19, 2022","“The Ecopreneurs,” a New Salesforce+ Series Debuts Featuring Global Innovators Combating Climate Change","

“The Ecopreneurs,” a new series that champions how global entrepreneurs are working to solve climate change, debuts today on Salesforce+, a new streaming service that offers live experiences and on-demand original content.
Why it’s important: This docu-style series sets out to highlight how everyday people — business workers, surfers, villagers, and scientists — are working to solve climate change in new, inspiring, and innovative ways.  
Details:
Available for streaming today, the first episode spotlights Michael Stewart, co-founder and director of SeaTrees. The organization partners with communities around the world to plant, regenerate, and protect critical coastal ecosystems like mangrove forests, kelp forests, and entire ridge-to-reef watersheds.“If we don’t stop before it’s too late, everything on the planet will become toxic and unable to support life. Saving the future lies in valuing emission removals as much as emission reductions, which is where SeaTrees comes in,” said Stewart. “We’ve found that people love the tangible idea of planting a tree. For us, it’s: Plant that same tree in the ocean.”Upcoming episodes will feature Donnel Baird, founder and CEO of BlocPower and Constantino Aucca and Florent Kaiser, Co-Founder and CEO of Acción Andina. 
Perspectives: 
Colin Fleming, SVP of Global Brand Marketing, Salesforce: “The Ecopreneurs” series shows first-hand how business can be the greatest platform for change. We’re in a climate crisis that affects everyone and the people who are standing up and taking the lead in preserving our planet are these ecopreneurs. In launching this series, we hope their stories will resonate beyond the workplace and inspire change in the world.”Dr. Whitney Johnston, Director of Ocean Sustainability Director, Salesforce: “This first episode highlighting Michael Stewart’s entrepreneurial journey with SeaTrees is a chance to introduce viewers to the urgency of tackling climate change and the opportunity for businesses to be a driving force in this effort. Salesforce’s blue carbon program launched last year is dedicated to lifting up ecopreneur voices and inspiring others to get onboard.”  
Zoom out: The series was developed in partnership with FORTUNE Brand Studio. FORTUNE produced the series and will host in-depth content on the ecopreneurs and the climate challenges highlighted in each episode.  
“Business efforts to address environmental problems are clearly on the rise, with companies large and small devising innovative business models to help save the planet,” said Alan Murray, CEO, Fortune. “By partnering with Salesforce, we intend to shine a spotlight on some of the most exciting and effective entrepreneurs in this space. It’s part of FORTUNE’s continuing effort to make business better.”

45,"January 19, 2022",Salesforce Renews Call for US Privacy Law to Protect People and Provide Businesses with Certainty,"

To protect people, promote trust in technology, drive innovation, and support U.S. leadership in the global digital economy, Salesforce has renewed its call for the United States Congress to pass a national, comprehensive privacy law that interoperates with global standards.
At its core, privacy is simple: it’s about people and their data. For people to have control over their own data, they must know what data is being collected about them and then be allowed to decide how that data is stored and used. And to offer this kind of control,  standards are needed for how businesses enable — and can be held accountable for enabling — transparency and control.  
Salesforce recognizes privacy as a fundamental human right and business imperative. Without a national law in place, however, people in the United States struggle to control their privacy journeys. Businesses, too, are struggling as they contend with a patchwork of state privacy laws related to how they operate and how they interact with their customers.
As COVID-19 continues to wreak havoc in yet another phase of the pandemic, we are seeing new urgency from our customers — organizations of every industry, sector, and vertical — to build work-from-anywhere environments that balance innovation, privacy, and a stellar customer experience. Against the backdrop of this new normal, Salesforce is focused on empowering our customers to responsibly unlock the value of their data while putting privacy first, no matter where they are working. To realize these benefits, Congress must pass a federal privacy law.
Comprehensive, effective privacy laws have been introduced, yet not enacted
Salesforce supports federal legislation that includes four fundamental concepts: 
Clear corporate obligations: Include obligations such as data minimization, purpose specification and limitation, and obligations that apply specifically to service providers/processors that align with Article 28 of the E.U.’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including those related to customer audit rights and authorization of subprocessors. Rights for individuals: Include the ability to access, correct, delete, and obtain a copy of their data. These rights appear in most global privacy laws, including the three recently-passed U.S. state laws. Americans are increasingly exercising these rights with companies that enable them. Meaningful transparency and control: Effective privacy laws should require companies to provide individuals with control over their data, including thorough just-in-time information about impactful data processing that points to controls that can be easily and effectively exercised throughout the data lifecycle.Effective enforcement: Strong privacy laws include a strong, empowered, expert central regulator, and some form of individual redress for individuals harmed by violative practices.
Complying with differing privacy requirements state by state is a difficult and costly task that adds complexity for individuals and businesses. Many of our customers are small and medium-sized businesses, and a federal privacy law that interoperates with existing regulations would enable them to comply more effectively with laws across state lines, and confidently enter global markets at a lower cost. 
No federal privacy law will be perfect, but bills introduced in both chambers of Congress — and by members of both parties — build upon the existing global standard and significantly increase consistent privacy protections across the United States meaning, privacy protection would not vary by your zip code.
Absence of a national privacy standard hinders U.S. leadership and innovation
In the three years since Marc Benioff, Chair, Co-CEO & Co-Founder of Salesforce called on Congress to pass a federal privacy law, over 100 privacy bills have been introduced at the state and federal levels. Three — in California, Virginia, and Colorado — have passed, and more will be introduced as legislatures reconvene. Globally, comprehensive privacy legislation is now in effect in China, Brazil, Kenya, and Thailand, all sharing concepts and interoperating with the global standard set by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The lack of a comprehensive national U.S. privacy standard has created a trust deficit, impeding organizations’ ability to compete in a global market where trust is paramount and is key to delivering technologies that could produce significant economic and social benefits. The United States can facilitate global cooperation on privacy and issues impacting digital trust and trade by exercising leadership in moving global privacy law forward and demonstrating shared values with our allies. 
For these reasons, Salesforce has renewed its call — with increased urgency — for Congress to pass a comprehensive privacy law that builds upon, and is interoperable with, the current global privacy standard. We stand ready to support a U.S. privacy law that will protect people, build trust in the technology industry, and strengthen global partnerships.

46,"January 18, 2022",Salesforce Appoints Lori Castillo Martinez as Executive Vice President and Chief Equality Officer,"

Salesforce has named Lori Castillo Martinez Executive Vice President and Chief Equality Officer. In this role she will lead the company’s global equality efforts, including equality strategy and programs. For the past six months, Lori has served as the interim Chief Equality Officer and was previously the head of Global Employee Relations and Equality — a role uniquely designed as a way to accelerate and integrate people and equality initiatives at Salesforce.
“Lori has already made a significant impact on our culture in her role as interim Chief Equality Officer,” said Brent Hyder, President and Chief People Officer at Salesforce. “She has a unique ability to build talent strategies guided by the voices of of our employees, while influencing company-wide action. This makes her the best leader to push us even further into this next chapter.”
Under Lori’s leadership, the company has continued to increase representation and create a more inclusive culture through equity-focused processes and programs. Key milestones include launching and scaling the Warmline (an employee advocacy program for Black, Latinx, Indigenous, LGBTQ+ and Women employees), introducing new inclusive talent processes informed by equality data, integrating bias and microaggression training into key talent moments, and creating the new Equality business partner team to deepen expertise and drive change in the largest functions.
We sat down with Lori to learn more about her and her vision for the Office of Equality at Salesforce:
Q. What is your vision for the role?
My vision is simple — to become the most inclusive workplace possible. With the full support and guidance of our employees, leaders and experts, we’ve developed a clear five-pronged strategy:
Accelerate representation: We will continue to strive to create a company that reflects the world around us, and that means accelerating representation. During my time here I’ve witnessed and supported significant innovations in our recruiting processes, especially as part of our racial equality and justice efforts, which have made deep impact like doubling our representation of Black hires year over year.Focus on employee experience: We know that representation is connected to more than just hiring – it requires focus on experiences and systemic change. We’re working to create access, advocacy, community. This year we introduced our Black Women Experience initiative to address the unique, multi-layered, and intersectional challenges that often confront this community.Design intentional systems: Being intentional about how we approach our systems is critical. We saw tangible results when we focused on our recruiting processes with a lens of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Now we’re taking the same approach for our internal systems like promotions, talent reviews, and manager processes.Lead with a global mindset: To be truly inclusive, we must have a global mindset. Our work can’t be defined by a U.S.-centered approach. We’re making some of our biggest investments in our global team and strategies so we can build personalized experiences that are created by and resonate with our employees and underrepresented communities around the world.Engage stakeholders: Finally, this work can’t happen in isolation — we have an opportunity to make the greatest impact together with our stakeholders. We have an entire ecosystem of customers, partners, and Trailblazers around the world who are also on this equality journey. We’ll continue to listen, invest in diverse suppliers, create an equitable talent marketplace, conduct learning opportunities, and use our platform to elevate leaders driving change.
I’m excited to share more about our vision, strategy, and early progress in our annual equality update in February.
Q. What excites you about this work?
I love innovation — breaking and redesigning systems. I’ve spent much of my career in HR and business operations roles which has given me a deeper understanding of the policies, processes, and cultural challenges that are foundational to DEI impact and systemic change. When I made the move to Salesforce in 2018, I felt I could make a real difference. And now I have the opportunity to change people’s individual experiences every day — that’s powerful.
Q. What is the biggest challenge you anticipate?
This has been an extremely trying few years, so one of the things I’m focused on is navigating societal issues by creating spaces to have challenging conversations and understanding the unique needs of our employees. We’ve developed a model of listening deeply, responding with meaningful action and impact, and partnering closely with our Equality Groups so the communities most impacted are truly part of the solution. One of the best examples of this is the Racial Equality and Justice Taskforce. We engaged BOLDforce, our employee resource group for Black employees, and gave them a seat at the table as we built our strategy. It has led to some of our most important work to date.
Q. Tell us a little more about you and your leadership style.
I am a proud Latina, and growing up I attended a very diverse all girls school in San Jose, CA — so I was raised thinking that women like me ruled the world. However, when I entered the workforce and realized I was one of very few women or Latinas in every room, reality set in. Fortunately, I was able to navigate and succeed because of career mentors, sponsors, and champions who cleared a path for me. I remember the day when I became a leader myself and a former mentee told me how meaningful it was that she could see a Latina in leadership. I realized then how many others were trying to navigate this reality and the immeasurable power of representation and advocacy. From that day on, I committed to bringing others along who didn’t have the privilege or access that I did. I call it the “ladder down” approach, bringing others up with you. That’s something I’ve taken with me throughout my career and will continue to do so.
From that day on, I committed to bringing others along who didn’t have the privilege or access that I did.Lori Castillo Martinez, Executive Vice President and Chief Equality Officer

47,"January 13, 2022",New Salesforce Digital Intelligence Tools Connect Commerce and Marketing Data for Personalized Experiences,"
As companies embrace a “commerce anytime, anywhere” mentality, digital experiences are becoming a key differentiator. In fact, 80% of customers agree that the experience a company provides is as important as its products or services.
In this digital-first, experience-focused environment, marketing and commerce teams must operate as one unit to delight customers, deliver the right products or services, and build loyalty. However, this vision isn’t always the reality. Our latest State of the Connected Customer Report found that 76% of customers expect consistent interactions across departments, but 54% said it generally seems like departments don’t share information.
This gap, in addition to holding a retailer back from meeting customer expectations, can actually be dangerous to a brand — 80% of consumers report abandoning retailers after just three bad experiences. To deliver on customer expectations, marketing and commerce teams must have shared insights and objectives that form the basis of unified experiences.
Connected marketing and commerce data creates unified experiences, drives ROI
Unified experiences can also drive engagement — and in turn, revenue. With marketing campaigns informed by first-party ecommerce data, promoting the right product messaging for the right person at the right moment can show the customer new shopping opportunities. The data gleaned from those efforts then informs the ecommerce team, who can in turn drive more qualified traffic and serve shoppers the most effective experience.
And, by combining upper-funnel marketing spend with bottom-of-the-funnel commerce revenue, digital teams get a real view of ROI and performance. These views offer a better picture of cancellations and returns (something not usually illuminated by traditional marketing data sources), help teams optimize their business impact, and curate customer journeys.

49,"January 12, 2022",Salesforce Data Reveals Global Digital Sales Surpassed $1 Trillion During 2021 Holiday Season,"

Inflation persisted throughout the holiday season with U.S. prices up 25% year-over-year
Holiday inventory shrank 2% (both global and U.S.) compared to 2020 due to supply chain issues 
Holiday demand pulled early with 30% of global sales recorded in the first three weeks of November
SAN FRANCISCO, January 12, 2022 — Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), the global leader in CRM, today released its 2021 Holiday Shopping Report, which analyzes shopping data from over one billion shoppers on the Salesforce Customer 360 platform and activity across commerce, marketing, and service (including 24 of the top 30 U.S. online retailers). 
While Cyber Week saw muted digital growth in 2021, early November and late December surges helped retailers break new sales records. Consumers spent $1.14 trillion online globally and $257 billion in the U.S., compared to $1.1 trillion and $236 billion in 2020. 
Top Salesforce 2021 holiday shopping insights
Salesforce data highlights trends that shaped the holiday season, including:
Shoppers splurged early and late this holiday season:  Shoppers were eager to secure their gifts ahead of the retail rush to avoid issues with shipping delays and out-of-stock products, with 30% of global holiday sales completed by November 22. Cyber Week accounted for 23% of global sales (down from 24% in 2020). As consumers missed online shipping cut-off dates and concerns grew around new COVID-19 variants, 23% of global digital sales were placed between December 18 and December 31. Stores that offered curbside or in-store pickup options over the same time period captured 62% of these final global sales.Digital-first consumers embraced flexible payment methods: With high holiday prices and discounts in the U.S. down 10% year-over-year (YoY), overall use of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services in the U.S. during the holiday season increased 40% compared to 2020. Consumers turned to these offerings throughout the holiday season to offset the higher price tags. Alternative payment forms, including PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay, also increased by 15% YoY in the U.S.Luxury handbags and home furniture were the fastest-growing categories online: As consumers shifted their spending from needs to wants this holiday season, luxury handbags had the highest YoY global growth with an increase of 45% in online sales. Home furniture and general footwear trailed closely behind at +34% and +32% growth respectively.Social commerce continues to influence consumer buying behavior: A survey of 1,600 global shoppers from Salesforce’s 4th edition of the Connected Shoppers Report found that by 2023, 25% of shopping is projected to happen beyond a retailer or brand’s website, app, or physical store. Over the 2021 holiday season, 4% of global digital sales on a mobile device were made through a social media app and 10% of mobile traffic originated from consumers browsing through social networks. As retailers begin to build in the metaverse, it’s clear that shoppers are ready to purchase across new channels.Stores played a critical role this holiday: While consumers continued to embrace digital this holiday, physical stores proved to be key throughout the shopping season. In fact, 60% of global digital sales were influenced by brick-and-mortar – from generating to fulfilling demand. The evolving role of the store – and associates – helped to break down friction across digital and physical touchpoints.
“Despite the lingering pandemic and countless obstacles such as supply chain logistics, low inventory, and fewer discounts, consumers flocked online to close out this holiday shopping season with a bang,” said Rob Garf, VP and GM of Retail, Salesforce. “As we move into a new year, retailers must push their brands to platforms such as social, gaming, messaging, and the metaverse to engage shoppers where they are discovering and buying products. They must also double down on efforts to reimagine physical stores to support continually changing digital experiences.”

52,"December 21, 2021",Salesforce Net Zero Cloud Wins Business Sustainability Award,"
Salesforce was today named a winner of the 2021 SEAL Business Sustainability Awards, earning top honors in the Sustainable Product category for Net Zero Cloud. The SEAL Sustainable Product Award honors innovative products that are “purpose-built” for a sustainable future.
The SEAL Awards celebrate companies that are leading in sustainability efforts and positive environmental impact to treat climate change with the urgency it requires. This marked the second consecutive year SEAL recognized Salesforce for its sustainability efforts — the company also won the SEAL Environmental Initiative Award in 2020.

Salesforce believes that climate change is the most important issue facing our planet and every thing that calls it home, and no issue is more deserving of our collective action and attention. 
“It is an honor to receive the SEAL Awards in the Sustainable Product category for our innovation and sustainability efforts, especially at a time when the planet needs urgent solutions to fight the climate emergency,” said Ari Alexander, VP & GM of Net Zero Cloud at Salesforce. “We’re committed to investing in Net Zero Cloud to continue to drive impact and help companies big and small and across all industries to reach Net Zero, faster.”

Salesforce Net Zero Cloud

Salesforce created Net Zero Cloud to help businesses – across all industries and of any size – easily track, analyze, and report reliable environmental data, and get actionable insights to take meaningful climate action. In fact, Net Zero Cloud transforms a complex process of carbon accounting that could take months into one that takes just weeks. 
Salesforce is on a mission to drive meaningful climate action at scale. Salesforce achieved Net Zero across its full value chain and reached 100% renewable energy for its global operations in September. And, the company’s Climate Action Plan aligns to a 1.5°C future by focusing on six sustainability priorities, which can be a blueprint for others to accelerate their Net Zero journeys: Emissions Reduction, Carbon Removal, Trillion Trees & Ecosystem Restoration, Education & Mobilization, Innovation, and Regulation & Policy.

54,"December 16, 2021",Salesforce Report Reveals 3% Rise in Post-Cyber Week Digital Sales in U.S.,"

Digital sales remained strong as retailers closed out the 2021 holiday shopping season, with consumers around the globe maintaining or increasing their early December spending compared with last year. This is despite persistent economic challenges caused by inflation, low inventory, and fewer discounts. 
Salesforce analyzed global shopping data from more than one billion consumers on Commerce Cloud and Marketing Cloud (including 24 of the top 30 U.S. online retailers) and found:
Key December holiday insights (November 30 — December 13)
Early holiday season demand leads to smoother December sales: Post-Cyber Week digital sales remained flat globally year on year (YoY) at $268 billion (0% growth). U.S. digital sales grew modestly over the same time period at 3% YoY growth, with $61 billion in holiday orders placed. Supply chain issues continue to impact holiday inventory and sales: With product availability down 7% globally and 8% in the U.S. YoY, holiday discounts continued to trend downwards after Cyber Week. The global average discount rate dropped to 16%, a 9% YoY decrease. U.S. shoppers saw discount rates drop to 17% after Cyber Week, a 12% YoY decrease. In the face of higher prices, consumers financed purchases: The Average Selling Price (ASP) after Cyber Week was up 25% in the U.S. and 9% globally YoY. Buy Now, Pay Later offerings continue to trend upward to offset the higher cost of goods this holiday season. Seven percent of all online global orders were processed using this option between the first day of Cyber Week and December 13, with 48% YOY growth.Holiday shipping cut-off dates spur flurry of last-minute shopping: While post-Cyber Week growth was sluggish, data indicates a pick up in global and U.S. shopping activity on Friday, December 10 and continuing through to Monday, December 13 as shoppers rushed to finish online shopping ahead of the December 15 shipping cutoff. Sales over this period grew 4% YoY globally and 8% in the U.S., far outpacing the average across the previous two weeks combined.Product categories with the strong YoY growth post-Cyber Week include:Luxury handbags (+34%) Furniture (+31%  Electronics & Accessories (+30%)
The Salesforce perspective: 
“Early December data confirms that holiday demand has smoothed out this year, with consumers shopping early and often,” said Rob Garf, VP and GM of Retail, Salesforce. “While a spike in digital sales never came during or after Cyber Week, retailers should be encouraged by how steady digital shopping habits and sales have been in the face of higher prices, fewer discounts, and less inventory.”

2021 Salesforce Holiday Insights and Predictions Methodology
To help retailers and brands benchmark holiday performance, Salesforce analyzes aggregated data to produce holiday insights from the activity of over a billion global shoppers across more than 54 countries powered by Commerce Cloud, in addition to Marketing Cloud and Service Cloud data from retailers. Salesforce’s holiday data set includes 24 of the top 30 U.S. online retailers on the 2021 Digital Commerce 360 list and utilizes publicly available third-party data sources.
To qualify for inclusion in the analysis set, a digital commerce site must have transacted throughout the analysis period, in this case October 1, 2019 through December 13, 2021, and met a monthly minimum visit threshold. Additional data hygiene factors are applied to ensure consistent metric calculation.
The Salesforce holiday predictions are not indicative of the operational performance of Salesforce or its reported financial metrics including GMV growth and comparable customer GMV growth.

55,"December 14, 2021","Salesforce Partners with One Tree Planted to Grow & Conserve 500,000 Native Trees in Fire-Ravaged British Columbia","

As part of its 100 million tree goal, Salesforce will grow and conserve 500,000 trees in the wildfire-ravaged Fraser Plateau in British Columbia, helping accelerate reforestation efforts and mitigate the impacts of climate change
The partnership with One Tree Planted will also see a new tree equity initiative in 2022 that will engage youth in a Toronto-based urban reforestation project
Salesforce today announced a partnership with One Tree Planted to grow and conserve 500,000 native trees on Nazko First Nation Territory in the Fraser Plateau in British Columbia. The high-priority region is still recovering from a 2017 wildfire that burned over 540,000 hectares. The impact of this reforestation will reduce recovery time by decades, regenerating the environment and benefitting the communities that live on the land. 
Salesforce will partner with One Tree Planted on additional Canadian reforestation projects to achieve its 100 million tree goal, and accelerate 1T.org — a global movement founded in partnership with the World Economic Forum, to restore, conserve, and grow one trillion trees by 2030.  
“The climate change crisis is the number one issue facing humanity today. Our partnership with One Tree Planted demonstrates how we are turning our sustainability commitment into meaningful community impact,” said Patrick Flynn, Vice President and Global Head of Sustainability, Salesforce. “At Salesforce, we believe business can be the greatest platform for change, and we are committed to serving the interests of all our stakeholders – including the environment. It is critical that every company do their part to invest in nature-based solutions, reduce emissions, and work towards becoming Net Zero. We don’t have time to waste.“
“This partnership with Salesforce is exactly what we need to catalyze large-scale and impact-driven reforestation,” said Matt Hill, Founder and President of One Tree Planted. “When we combine public and private capital, local environmental agencies and communities, and smart restoration strategies powered by best-in-class technology, we can build coalitions that result in tangible action.”

Tree equity initiative focuses on long-term climate justice 
Just ahead of COP26, the November 2021 UN climate change conference, Salesforce announced a tree equity and urban reforestation initiative in the city of Malton, Ontario in partnership with One Tree Planted. As part of the partnership, and working with four local schools, youth will learn about the historical roots of environmental justice and how trees are a solution for creating equity. They will also plant 720 large trees around the Claireville Dam Restoration Site. 
The initiative aims to address the region’s “urban heat island effect” — a result of infrastructure absorbing and re-emitting the sun’s heat to create higher temperatures than outlying natural areas. Urban forestry will help to gradually reduce the heat island effect of Malton, while also sequestering carbon, improving air quality, absorbing rainwater, and beautifying communities. 
“We are proud to apply our resources to engage local organizations and volunteers, including Salesforce employees, to make communities greener and healthier, reduce emissions, and empower others to drive climate action,” said Flynn.
Salesforce powers One Tree Planted reforestation efforts in Canada and globally
One Tree Planted has grown over 40 million trees in 43 countries since 2014. Planting is only part of the process. Equally critical is the long-term monitoring and conservation of trees to make meaningful impact and achieve ambitious environmental restoration targets.
Technology is vital in this step, helping One Tree Planted plan, implement, and monitor multiple global projects at scale. The non-profit works with Salesforce to track all of its reforestation projects in Canada and around the world with quality reporting and dynamic integration across organizational activity.

“Reforestation is often viewed through the lens of addressing climate change and achieving ambitious environmental restoration targets, however equally valuable are the technology and mechanics to actually mobilize resources and get results,” said Stephanie Clement, North American Project Manager for Canada and Northeastern USA at One Tree Planted. “It all comes full circle when we can leverage the best technology infrastructure like Salesforce to power projects of global significance — rebuilding after natural disasters and supporting the continued management of unique, biodiverse old growth forests.”
Salesforce’s nature-based solutions accelerate sustainability efforts across the globe
Salesforce is on an accelerated mission to leverage its full power to create a more sustainable and equitable future for all. While trees and other nature-based solutions are absolutely vital, businesses must do more in order to tackle climate change. 
Some key initiatives at Salesforce include:
Salesforce became a Net Zero company in 2021, across the full value chain and achieved 100% renewable energy for its global operations.Salesforce has been on its sustainability journey for more than a decade. Executing on a comprehensive Climate Action Plan, the company is helping drive toward a 1.5 degree future by focusing on six sustainability priorities: emissions reduction, carbon removal, trillion trees & ecosystem restoration, education & mobilization, innovation, and regulation & policy. With its Net Zero Cloud, Salesforce is supercharging its efforts to help accelerate the world’s largest businesses to Net Zero, faster. Net Zero Cloud is designed to help customers track and reduce their emissions and take impactful action on climate.

56,"December 9, 2021",Salesforce Invests Additional $3M to Support Climate Resilience,"

Donations to American Forests, Ceres, National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, Clean Energy Buyers Institute, and RMI aim to support communities disproportionately impacted by climate change

Society is in a planetary emergency — a climate crisis that impacts everyone, especially the most vulnerable. To help limit the effects of climate change and protect communities in need, Salesforce has announced more than $3 million in new donations towards ecosystem restoration and climate justice. This adds to Salesforce’s $300 million commitment, announced in October, in support of these efforts.
In October, for the first time ever, the United Nations passed a resolution recognizing access to a healthy and sustainable environment as a universal right. This is a significant step in promoting and protecting human rights around the world, and one Salesforce has vocally supported. However, people in every country, especially those from marginalized communities, continue to face disproportionate climate risk.
Salesforce’s new donations will support two key areas. The first is ecosystem restoration, specifically focused on advancing tree equity and coastal resilience in an effort to protect communities that are experiencing extreme heat, lack of tree covering, and increased flooding. The second is climate justice, with an emphasis on advancing decarbonization while focusing on the needs of those most impacted by climate change. 
The ecosystem restoration grantees include: 
American Forests: As the nation’s oldest conservation nonprofit, American Forests is dedicated to creating healthy and resilient forests, from cities to large forested landscapes. Salesforce’s donation to American Forests provides critical support to tree equity efforts, helping cities adapt to climate change by increasing tree canopy in neighborhoods that need trees the most, particularly in Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) communities. It also helps place those facing barriers to employment into urban forestry jobs.National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF): A national nonprofit organization committed to sustaining, restoring, and enhancing the nation’s plants, habitats, and wildlife. Salesforce’s donation will help mitigate the impact of disasters on historically marginalized coastal communities through multidisciplinary community planning, with a focus on nature-based solutions that protect local communities and improve essential habitat for wildlife.
The climate justice grantees include: 
RMI: An independent nonprofit that transforms global energy systems through market-driven solutions to align with a 1.5°C future and secure a clean, prosperous, zero-carbon future for all. Salesforce’s donation to RMI will enhance climate resilience, focusing on the most vulnerable populations, while also advancing decarbonization.Clean Energy Buyers Institute (CEBI): A public good charity that solves the toughest market and policy barriers to achieve a carbon-free energy system. Salesforce’s donation to CEBI will maximize the environmental and social impacts of clean energy procurement with a specific focus on enhancing energy security and resilience, and prioritization of diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice.Ceres: A nonprofit organization transforming the economy to build a just and sustainable future for people and the planet. Salesforce’s donation will help Ceres integrate environmental and climate justice priorities into its approach to advance ambitious corporate climate policy advocacy that will result in a more just and sustainable future.
“Salesforce has been a true market leader in continually pushing the envelope in what it means to be a good corporate citizen,” said Miranda Ballentine, CEO of the Clean Energy Buyers Institute. “Not only deploying renewable energy, but also ensuring that renewables are good for the environment, good for communities, and add grid resilience. Salesforce readily offers their own thinking and best practices to other companies, making all of us better.”
Dr. Jane Mantey, senior manager of environmental justice policy at Ceres shared, “The time is now for environmental and climate justice to take center stage in our nation’s approach to resolving the climate crisis and our long history with environmental racism. Salesforce is leading by example, modeling a myriad of ways companies can move the U.S. towards a more just, equitable, and sustainable economy. We are grateful and look forward to using this grant to help restore and build healthy, thriving, and resilient communities across the U.S. by mobilizing more companies and investors to become bold advocates for environmental and climate justice.”
A pledge to act, and to inspire action
Salesforce recognizes that the effects of climate change are not equal, and intends for these donations to elevate climate justice in underserved communities. 
As Salesforce continues to expand its philanthropy efforts in ecosystem restoration and climate justice, it asks others — particularly other businesses — to join in the movement. Together, today’s businesses must act boldly to combat climate change.

57,"December 9, 2021",Salesforce Unveils the Next Phase of Dreampass and New Health and Safety Innovations to Navigate In-Person Events,"

Editor’s Note: This article references Dreampass and Salesforce’s Health & Safety Playbook, which have been expanded upon with the launch of Safety Cloud. For the latest on Salesforce’s health & safety-related innovations, check out this press release and FAQ.
The Salesforce Event Health and Safety Playbook, available to any business as a free resource, offers best practices for hosting attendees more safely at live events
Salesforce’s new Dreampass product is now available for organizations to bring people back together to help enable safer experiences by easily applying health protocols to events
Salesforce’s transition into verifiable credential management helps businesses streamline processes and verify health credentials to further strengthen stakeholder trust

Over the last 20 months, businesses and consumers have adapted to nationwide lockdowns, digital-first work, and virtual healthcare. As people and organizations continue to adjust to a changing pandemic and emerging COVID-19 variants, they are also looking for ways to resume gatherings in person in this new world.

Today, Salesforce is releasing the next phase of Dreampass along with other health and safety innovations — including the Salesforce Event Health and Safety Playbook and verifiable credential management — to help every organization build trusted environments, bring people together more safely, and help deliver a healthy future.
“The world is craving more opportunities to get back together again in person,” said Meredith Flynn-Ripley, SVP of CRM Product Management, Salesforce. “In this evolving pandemic, organizations need a robust, agile way to more effectively and safely deliver in-person experiences as part of their day-to-day operations. Now, with Salesforce’s new health and safety innovations, organizations can create more secure, safe, and verifiable workflows and deploy applications that help protect employees, customers, and communities at events.”
Gather together in-person safely with Salesforce’s support
Traditional monitoring and health status management is complex, cumbersome, and manual. Organizations need a robust, scalable way to streamline COVID-19 safety protocols. Together, the Salesforce Event Health and Safety Playbook and Dreampass provide technology along with best practices to help businesses more effectively and safely deliver in-person experiences.
As the pandemic evolves, Salesforce’s strategy and execution for hosting events has evolved with it. And now, Salesforce is bringing some of the lessons learned and insights gained in producing Dreamforce 2021 to the public with a free resource to help other organizations reintroduce in-person events.
Co-authored by Salesforce Chief People Officer Brent Hyder and Chief Marketing Officer Sarah Franklin, the Salesforce Event Health and Safety Playbook includes sections on: 
Assembling the right team of expertsLeading with COVID-19 vaccines and testingEmbracing on-site protocols and practicesCreating an easy, tech-enabled experienceInvesting in preparation along with transparent, proactive communication 
“Informed by scientific data and clinical expertise, the Salesforce Event Health and Safety Playbook provides organizations with best practices they need to safely manage in-person events,” said Dr. Geeta Nayyar, Chief Medical Officer, Salesforce. “The playbook provides lessons, best practices and insights surrounding our own experience hosting in-person events that we’re excited to share with others.”

In today’s uncertain health environment, vaccines and testing are critical for getting us together more safely in concert with secure, personalized, and timely communications that help build trust between organizations and consumers. Research from Salesforce’s Connected Health Consumer Report recently found that consumers who trust health organizations are over six times more likely to opt into timely communications. 
Now, with Salesforce’s evolution of Dreampass, any organization can create more trusted event experiences. Available in January, Dreampass will enable organizations to scale collection and verification of COVID-19 health status, such as managing proof of vaccination and integrating with COVID-19 testing vendors like CVS Health. Dreampass will also integrate with partners, such as CLEAR and The Commons Project, to facilitate the digital health status verification process.
With Dreampass, organizations can create agile, automated communications that inform attendees about event procedures and policies. Dreampass centralizes data such as event registration, customer information, and COVID-19 health status for each attendee and then generates a secure, multifactor credential for the event.

Verifiable health credentialing for employers, customers, and communities wherever they are 
Evolving ways to share vaccination and testing status, Salesforce is expanding into verifiable credential management (VCM) with the recent acquisition of Credential Master. This makes it possible for partners to directly integrate with Dreampass and the Salesforce platform. Employees and customers will be able to share their COVID-19 health status or vaccine credentials with organizations through QR codes in digital wallets with a single tap, and their health status will be securely recorded and shared with Dreampass for future events.
VCM is an open ecosystem that will allow other verifiable credential providers to integrate with Dreampass. The expansion into the VCM space will also allow Salesforce to build verifiable credentials into other offerings.

60,"December 8, 2021","Salesforce Releases Health & Safety Playbook to Help Organizations Plan Safe, In-Person Events","

Editor’s Note – February 1, 2022: Today, Salesforce launched Safety Cloud, expanding upon Dreampass and Salesforce’s Health & Safety Playbook. This article was updated with a link to the newly expanded Health & Safety Playbook. For the latest on Salesforce’s health & safety-related innovations, check out this press release and FAQ.
Events have always been our calling card. But the past 20 months have challenged us to reimagine how we gather in today’s pandemic world. We’ve seen the power of digital-first events, but that doesn’t mean events have to be digital-only. There’s an undeniable magic that comes from in-person connection, and our community is eager to reconnect.
With this in mind, we took a beginner’s mindset to Dreamforce, our global family reunion, and thought critically about what it would take to bring our community together more safely in-person again. It looked a little bit different than it has in years past, when we’ve invited 170,000 people, but the experience was just as awesome. At Dreamforce San Francisco, we welcomed 1,000+ attendees and for the first time ever held the entire event – keynote included! – outdoors. We also streamed it live, drawing more than 167 million views from 177 countries via Salesforce+.
How did we do it? Here are five key insights and learnings from our new Salesforce Event Health and Safety Playbook, now available for download (Editor’s Note: Form Required).
1) Assemble the right team of experts
Health and safety is the single most crucial component to event success, and it can’t be done alone. Salesforce used a team of dedicated experts, event partners, and COVID-19 testing vendors to help deliver a safe, unique event.
Our team developed this year’s Dreamforce health and safety strategy from the ground up — including our rigorous testing cadence — and managed the execution of robust health and safety protocols around the event. In preparation for the event, our team modeled more than 30 different event-safety experiences based on different possible scenarios. We kept a close pulse on local government guidance and the latest advice from our health and medical experts, such as Salesforce Chief Medical Officer Dr. Geeta Nayyar, to help ensure our event met recommended guidelines.
2) Lead with vaccines and testing
Today’s events are all about leading with trust, our company’s #1 value. It’s not just about making the experience safer, it’s also about making people feel safe before they ever step foot into your event.
In addition to asking for proof of vaccination, we required Dreamforce attendees to submit to a rigorous schedule of pre- and post-arrival testing — including submitting two negative tests before attending the event. Tests were conducted 96 and 72 hours before the event and to make it easier for attendees, we mailed individuals an at-home test kit or gave them the option to test at a local testing facility. Out of 18,000 tests administered at Dreamforce, only 12 were not authorized to attend — and all authorized attendees were cleared through our testing protocols.
3) Embrace safe onsite protocols and practices
Once onsite, it’s game time for health and safety practices. At Dreamforce, we prioritized large outdoor spaces and leveraged our own technology to carefully control access to the event. Attendees entered each day through specific checkpoints and had to submit to multi-step, multi-factor authentication before stepping onsite — including scanning QR codes and event credentials, validating personal IDs, and passing through security screenings.
Dreamforce attendees were also required to complete a daily wellness attestation and check for symptoms before entering the event. We were also prepared to implement contact tracing or support isolation in the event that attendees tested positive.
4) Create an easy, tech-enabled experience
With so much testing, it’s essential that event verification processes be easy to follow. At Salesforce, we know a thing or two about using our technology to help bring people together more safely — both at our offices and events.
By using Dreampass, Salesforce’s product designed to help deliver safer in-person events, we were able to scale collection and verification of COVID-19 health status while creating agile, automated communications that inform attendees about event procedures and policies. In addition, Dreamforce attendees were able to upload their proof of vaccination ahead of the event and have it automatically routed to a reviewer. The verification process then triggered test kits to be shipped to each guest outlining next steps for testing. Once attendees’ tests came back negative, Dreampass automatically generated a pass for attendees containing their health verification status. The result was a safer, more secure, and smooth experience for everyone.

5) Invest in proactive communication
Now more than ever, communication around events is key. Before Dreamforce, we hosted two office hours for attendees to set expectations and explain our protocols and processes. We also hosted two digital “swab parties” with our at-home test kit vendor to guide attendees on the 96- and 72-hour pre-event test instructions. In addition, we established a “Dreamforce Buddy” program, connecting a Salesforce employee with each guest using texts, phone calls, and emails to answer questions, provide guidance, and help escalate any issues.
Finally, we sent “Know Before You Go” emails to ensure attendees had the latest updates on protocols and processes ahead of the event. We also leveraged Slack to keep employees, staff, and crew connected in real time to help ensure a smoother on-site experience for everyone.
Dreamforce San Francisco and Dreamforce New York remind us of the magic that comes from being together. By letting science guide our approach, we hope that more of us — on more occasions — can come together with trust and confidence to reconnect as a community.
Check out the Salesforce Event Health and Safety Safety Playbook for more insights on the steps Salesforce took to help bring people together in-person more safely. And for more details on how we used Salesforce technology to bring Dreamforce back to San Francisco, see here.
Please note that this is a Salesforce Playbook for US events, shared for reference only. Any business or organization looking to host an in-person event should follow local guidance and legislation and consult with relevant experts to draft their own health and safety protocols.

61,"December 7, 2021",Ford Builds New Technology on Salesforce Field Service Platform,"

Quick Take: Ford Motor Company, a global auto manufacturer and longtime innovator in the automotive industry, today announced the launch of VIIZR, a CRM tool built on Salesforce Field Service, designed to empower small business owners — plumbers, electricians, caterers, and landscapers — to run their businesses from anywhere. 
Driving the news: A recent study found that only one in five small business owners are currently happy with how their business manages customer and employee relationships. Only 10% believe today’s business productivity software tools are designed for businesses of their size, with most believing that such solutions are built for much larger companies.1
VIIZR fills that gap by bringing together Ford’s commercial vehicle business, Ford Pro, and Salesforce Field Service to address key pain points felt most often by small business tradespeople, including invoicing, scheduling, and managing service requests. 
How it Works: VIIZR provides affordable, easy-to-use CRM tools enabling tradespeople to maximize productivity and serve customers digitally and on-the-go. VIIZR users can:
Stay on track with digitized quotes, work orders, invoicing, and job management.  Connect with customers through an all-in-one customer profile, making it easy to communicate and provide a better customer experience.
Streamline operations with capabilities for scheduling, dispatching, and coordination of field technicians, improving productivity and efficiency.Eliminate waste by boosting efficiency. Tradespeople can reduce waste from their business through real-time job scheduling, which saves time and fuel; while digital invoicing can help save paper.
Zoom out: Ford is currently looking for small businesses to test drive the VIIZR platform on a complimentary basis with its Early Access Program. 
What they’re saying:
“Today, companies of every kind are becoming software companies, and every customer expects a digital first experience,” said Tyler Prince, EVP, Alliances & Channels, Salesforce. “Ford is transforming its business and expanding into the digital technology market and Salesforce is excited to see Ford build deeper and differentiated relationships with its customers as VIIZR evolves.”  “Effective field service requires companies to match the expertise of their workforce with their customers’ requirements, and manage the complexities of scheduling – and for many small business trades today, managing customer interactions and mobile workers involves time-consuming, manual processes done on paper,” Paul Whitelam, SVP & GM, Field Service Management at Salesforce said. “VIIZR is helping tradespeople digitize their businesses, empowering them to focus less on back-end processes and more on their craft.”“The automotive industry is transforming from pushing metals to delivering customer value and outcomes through a customer centric-model. Ford’s work with VIIZR represents a new vision for how automakers can best serve and deliver value to their customers,” said Achyut Jajoo, SVP & GM, Manufacturing and Automotive at Salesforce. “Ford is evolving their relationship with commercial customers to go beyond sales and service and becoming part of their customers’ business value proposition by empowering them with the digital tools they need to run and grow their businesses.” “Ford Pro helps commercial customers maximize productivity,” Ford Pro CEO Ted Cannis said. “We know the back-office is a major pain point for the trades, who are often writing up paperwork from the cabin of their truck or van. VIIZR gives that time back, providing greater returns to these small businesses and empowering them to better service their customers.”

62,"December 1, 2021",Salesforce Data Reveals Record High $62 Billion in U.S. 2021 Cyber Week Digital Sales,"

U.S. holiday sales spiked in first three weeks of November with digital sales up 10 percent year-over year; YoY sales increased 4 percent for Cyber Week 
Inflation caused a spike in pricing for holiday goods; prices were up 11 percent year-over-year in the U.S.
Holiday inventory in the U.S. shrank 6 percent compared to 2020 due to supply chain issues 
SAN FRANCISCO — December 1, 2021 — Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), the global leader in CRM, today released its annual Cyber Week report, which analyzes shopping data from over one billion shoppers on the Salesforce Customer 360 platform and activity across commerce, marketing, and service (including 24 of the top 30 U.S. online retailers). Overall, 2021 global online sales hit an all-time high of $275 billion, up 2 percent compared to 2020, and $62 billion in the U.S., up 4 percent compared to 2020. 
The data shows that digital patterns established during the pandemic are still a force this holiday season, with strong early November growth driven by consumers who were not deterred by higher prices, lower discounts, and decreased product inventory. Cyber Week (November 23-29) itself saw muted growth as a result of these early-season shoppers working ahead of the traditional shopping peak.

Top Salesforce 2021 shopping insights
The major digital holiday shopping period is over: Holiday shopping began in earnest at the start of the season with consumers spending $74 billion over the first three weeks of November (up 10 percent YoY) and $297 billion globally (up 5 percent YoY). During Cyber Week, U.S. sales reached $62 billion (up 4 percent YoY) and global sales reached $275 billion (up 2 percent YoY). The largest single shopping day over Cyber Week was Black Friday (up 2 percent YoY global, up 5 percent YoY U.S.) as holiday demand was smoothed out across the entire month of November. Consumers find high prices and fewer discounts: Holiday inflation coupled with lower discounts meant deals were harder to find this year. Over Cyber Week, the Average Selling Price (ASP) was up 11 percent in the U.S. and 5 percent globally compared to last year. Meanwhile, the average discount over Cyber Week was 26 percent in the U.S. (down 8 percent YoY) and 24 percent globally (down 8 percent).Holiday supply chain crunch leaves shoppers with fewer gift options: Early and persistent supply chain issues meant digital shelves weren’t as well-stocked as in years past. Product catalogs (number of products being sold) over Cyber Week shrank 6 percent in the U.S. and 5 percent globally compared to last year. Holiday inflation leads to holiday financing: With higher prices and fewer discounts, shoppers embraced Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) offerings. Globally, BNPL usage over Cyber Week grew 29 percent YoY (8 percent of all orders) with over $22 billion in holiday orders financed. On Black Friday, 7 percent of global orders and 4 percent of U.S. orders were paid for with BNPL.   Consumers favor stores with order online, curbside pickup services: Consumers continued to prioritize health, safety, convenience, and trust this Cyber Week. U.S. stores offering curbside or in-store pickup grew their revenue by 50 percent more YoY over Black Friday than retailers not offering these pickup options. 
“While online sales leveled off over Cyber Week compared to the holiday surge we experienced during the pandemic, digital shoppers drove significant sales for the first few weeks of November and maintained the high Cyber Week baseline they established in 2020,” said Rob Garf, VP and GM of Retail, Salesforce. “Consumers entered into this holiday season aware of supply chain bottlenecks and inflation and shopped early and often to smooth out the demand we usually see concentrated over one week.”
… digital shoppers drove significant sales for the first few weeks of November and maintained the high Cyber Week baseline they established in 2020.”Rob Garf, VP and GM of Retail, Salesforce

Salesforce powers holiday shopping 
This year, Salesforce helped retailers like Crocs, e.l.f. Cosmetics and others around the world double down on digital as the pandemic continued to push shoppers toward online purchasing. Powering a record start to the holiday season, Salesforce customers drove more than 100 million orders in November. With consumers continuing to shop online, delivering fast, easy, and personalized digital experiences is more important than ever and was made possible by:
Einstein: Artificial intelligence continues to play a large role in how consumers shop. Cyber Week shoppers engaged with 73.6 million AI-driven product recommendations powered by Einstein.Commerce Cloud: Global digital sales powered by Commerce Cloud grew 4 percent year-over-year on Thanksgiving, 7 percent on Black Friday and 9 percent on Cyber Monday. Marketing Cloud: Global marketing communications surged over Cyber Week with 40 billion messages sent, increasing 34 percent YoY. Mobile push notifications grew 114 percent and email volume increased by 25 percent YoY. Service Cloud: Call volumes increased by 39 percent YoY during Cyber Week. Service case creations also increased by 38 percent YoY during Cyber Week. Over 5.3 million chatbot sessions were initiated over Cyber Week.

2021 Salesforce Holiday Insights and Predictions Methodology
To help retailers and brands benchmark holiday performance, Salesforce analyzes aggregated data to produce holiday insights from the activity of over a billion global shoppers across more than 54 countries powered by Commerce Cloud, in addition to Marketing Cloud and Service Cloud data from retailers. Salesforce’s holiday data set includes 24 of the top 30 U.S. online retailers on the 2021 Digital Commerce 360 list and utilizes publicly available third-party data sources.
To qualify for inclusion in the analysis set, a digital commerce site must have transacted throughout the analysis period, in this case October 1, 2019 through November 29, 2021, and met a monthly minimum visit threshold. Additional data hygiene factors are applied to ensure consistent metric calculation.
The Salesforce holiday predictions are not indicative of the operational performance of Salesforce or its reported financial metrics including GMV growth and comparable customer GMV growth.

San Francisco — November 30, 2021 —Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), the global leader in CRM, today announced results for its third quarter of fiscal 2022 ended October 31, 2021.
“We delivered another phenomenal quarter, fueling strong revenue growth, margin and cash flow,” said Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO of Salesforce. “Salesforce is more relevant and strategic than ever as every company accelerates their digital transformation journey. Just as we’ve helped our customers navigate the pandemic, we’re now guiding them toward greater growth, customer success, health and safety, and trust. With the tremendous strength of our Customer 360 platform and Slack, we’re on track to reach $50 billion revenue in FY26.”
“Our disciplined approach continues to deliver record levels of operating margin this year,” said Amy Weaver, President and CFO. “During the third quarter, we again executed against the strong demand environment in front of us. Slack saw another strong quarter, and we are pleased with Slack’s representation in our largest deals. In this new world, Slack and our Customer 360 have never been more relevant.”
Salesforce delivered the following results for its fiscal third quarter:
Revenue: Total third quarter revenue was $6.86 billion, an increase of 27% year-over-year, and 26% in constant currency. Subscription and support revenues for the quarter were $6.38 billion, an increase of 25% year-over-year. Professional services and other revenues for the quarter were $0.48 billion, an increase of 45% year-over-year.
Operating Margin: Third quarter GAAP operating margin was 0.6%. Third quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 19.8%.
Earnings per Share: Third quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.47, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.27. Mark-to-market accounting of the company’s strategic investments benefited GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.27 based on a U.S. tax rate of 25% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.28 based on a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5%.
Cash: Cash generated from operations for the third quarter was $0.40 billion, an increase of 19% year-over-year. Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities ended the third quarter at $9.39 billion.
Remaining Performance Obligation: Remaining performance obligation ended the third quarter at approximately $36.3 billion, an increase of 20% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation ended the third quarter at approximately $18.8 billion, an increase of 23% year-over-year, 23% in constant currency.
As of November 30, 2021, the company is initiating its revenue guidance, GAAP earnings per share guidance, non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, and current remaining performance obligation growth guidance for its fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. As of November 30, 2021, the company is raising its revenue guidance previously  updated on September 23, 2021 for its full fiscal year 2022. As of November 30, 2021 the company is raising its operating cash flow guidance, GAAP earnings per share guidance, non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, GAAP operating margin guidance and non-GAAP operating margin guidance previously updated on August 25, 2021 for its full fiscal year 2022. As of November 30, 2021 the company is initiating its revenue guidance for its first quarter of fiscal year 2023. As of November 30, 2021 the company is reiterating its revenue guidance, GAAP operating margin guidance and non-GAAP operating margin guidance for its full fiscal year 2023 previously provided on September 23, 2021.
Management will provide further commentary around these guidance assumptions on its earnings call, which is expected to occur on November 30, 2021 at 2:00 PM Pacific Time.
Our guidance assumes no change to the value of the company’s strategic investment portfolio as it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses. In addition, the guidance below is based on estimated GAAP tax rates that reflect the company’s currently available information, and excludes forecasted discrete tax items such as excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The GAAP tax rates may fluctuate due to future acquisitions or other transactions.

(1) GAAP operating margin is the proportion of GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin is the proportion of non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue.
(2) The percentages shown above have been calculated based on the midpoint of the low and high ends of the revenue guidance for full years FY22 and FY23. 
The following is a per share reconciliation of GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance for the next quarter and the full year:

(1)The Company’s GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately 34% for the three months ended January 31, 2022, and approximately 11% for the year ended January 31, 2022. The GAAP tax rates may fluctuate due to discrete tax items and related effects in conjunction with certain provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, future acquisitions or other transactions.
(2) The Company’s projected GAAP and Non-GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share assumes no change to the value of our strategic investment portfolio resulting from ASU 2016-01 as it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses. While historically the company’s strategic investment portfolio has had a positive impact on the company’s financial results, that may not be true for future periods, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations that affect the publicly traded companies within the company’s strategic investment portfolio. The impact of future gains or losses from the company’s strategic investment portfolio could be material.
(3) The Company’s Non-GAAP tax provision uses a long-term projected tax rate of 21.5%, which reflects currently available information and could be subject to change.
For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures see the reconciliation of results and related explanations below.
Quarterly Conference Call
Salesforce plans to host a conference call at 2:00 p.m. (PT) / 5:00 p.m. (ET) to discuss its financial results with the investment community. A live webcast and replay details of the event will be available on the Salesforce Investor Relations website at www.salesforce.com/investor.

65,"November 17, 2021","Why Salesforce Is Bringing People Back Together In-Person, Now","

From reopening to reconnecting — the next phase of our Success From Anywhere strategy
For the last 20 months, we’ve worked remotely — and our company has thrived. We’ve hired more than 30,000 people remotely. We’ve had five consecutive quarters of growth. We’ve logged more code and met with more customers than ever before. And our employees have appreciated the flexibility this new way of working offers them.
Our Success From Anywhere approach has made us more productive than ever. And yet, something is missing.
That intangible magic that comes from being with people. Sure, we’ve moved our brainstorms, offsites, happy hours and team building activities onto Zoom, but it’s not quite the same as being in-person. Our employees agree — 77% say they want to get together with their team in-person by the end of the year.
The reality is the pandemic is not going away; it will be with us for some time. Given that, the question before us is: How do we combine the best of the Success From Anywhere world with the joy and spontaneity of in-person connection — not next year, but now? Here’s how we’re tackling it.
Reconnecting can’t wait for reopening: 
There’s been too much focus on return-to-office dates. With COVID case rates varying dramatically around the globe, a top-down, one-size-fits-all directive doesn’t work. Starting now, we are encouraging teams to gather in-person, as long as it’s safe and in alignment with local laws. We’ve proven that we can come together safely in-person through Dreamforce and our 65+ open offices around the globe. And I’ve seen first-hand how these gatherings can fundamentally improve team dynamics after months of not seeing each other. That’s why we’re encouraging all managers to bring their teams together — for a strategy session, workshop, or holiday party — by the end of the year.
Flex work is a team sport: 
In April, we introduced Success From Anywhere, providing employees with three new ways of working: Office-Flexible, Home-Based, and Office-Based. Now, we’re redefining how our teams work together with Flex Team Agreements. We’re empowering teams to decide how, when, and where they work — including how many days a week they come into the office and what kind of work they’ll continue to do at home. Teams can also decide how they communicate and what behaviors are most important to them. For instance, my team — Employee Success — has agreed to “No Meeting Fridays” and monthly Wellbeing days. We’ll also prioritize meeting in-person twice a year, as well as volunteer days and end-of-quarter celebrations to keep teams feeling connected.
It’s all about experimentation. We recently had our first “Async Week” where employees cancelled routine meetings to create space for more deep, focused work. Over 20,000 employees participated and 80% liked it. Moreover, 81% would like to repeat it quarterly. And we’re encouraging all employees to embrace flex behaviors like Focus Time and Setting Boundaries, to increase productivity and prioritize their wellbeing.
The office becomes an experience: 
There is still a very important need and purpose for physical space like our Towers — to bring people together in our Success From Anywhere world. Our trusted global campus will always be a creative, sustainable, and safe environment. Every time someone comes into our space, our goal is that it is always a world-class experience. Yet, we know that the way our employees use the office will continue to evolve as we come back. And with that, we are planning for flexibility.
Just 30% of our desks are being used on average, which frees us up to increase our social space from 40% to 60% to meet the new needs of our employees. We’re experimenting with new flex spaces, adding more booths, communal tables, and focus pods to create connection and innovation. We’ll continue to observe behaviors, listen to our employees, and try innovative approaches like leveraging sensor data to inform decisions as we go. We’ve even launched “on-sites in a box” to provide leaders with tips, tricks, and resources to bring people together again safely, successfully, and easily.
Digital-first demands a digital HQ: 
With the addition of Slack, we’ve created a digital HQ that is completely transforming the way we work. It’s where we connect, share information, get our work done and heck, hopefully have some fun. 76% of workers believe that how a company collaborates is a direct reflection of their culture and with Slack, we’ve measurably changed our culture for the better. This year, we’ve seen:
Individual and team productivity increased by 16% and 13%, respectivelyThe number of emails we sent decreased 46% as our teams turn to more collaborative, real-time communicationOur employees sent 58.7 million Slack messages and conducted 489,000 Slack Huddles — impromptu voice chats — in the last 30 days alone

The fact that the pandemic will continue to be part of our workplace is not exactly welcome news, but it gives us even more license to embrace a Success From Anywhere world — right now. The road to the future of work will not be a straight line and we will continue to practice and learn together. But by prioritizing connection and empowering employees to redefine the workplace on their own terms, we’re on the right path.
Learn more about Success From Anywhere and how we’re helping employees succeed together in the digital-first world.

66,"November 16, 2021",Salesforce.org Technology and Pro Bono Support Tops $1.45B in FY 2021,"

Salesforce announces a strengthened commitment to its Power of Us program with more free and discounted products and implementation services, and additional self-learning opportunities for nonprofits and education institutions.
Powerful CRM technology doesn’t just belong to the business community: It belongs to everyone. 
Salesforce has a long-standing commitment to make sure that the very best CRM technology is available for free or discounted to eligible nonprofits, schools, universities, and colleges. For the last 22 years, through the Power of Us program and as part of the 1:1:1 model, Salesforce has offered nonprofits and educational institutions 10 free licenses, industry data models like Nonprofit Success Pack (NPSP), and other free and discounted products. 
In Fiscal Year 2021 alone, this multi-pronged approach has totaled more than $1.45 billion in technology donations and pro bono support to nonprofit organizations around the world. 
Democratizing access to technology with strengthened commitment 
Today, Salesforce announced it will strengthen this commitment with easier access, additional discounted products and implementation services, and even more self-learning opportunities for eligible nonprofit and education organizations:
New and existing eligible users can access more discounted and free products and implementation services through a new Power of Us portal and improved program application process.

For no upfront costs, eligible organizations can also access Elevate*, Salesforce’s digital fundraising suite, to streamline their management of online donations with built-in payment processing donation pages.

More affordable implementation services, powered by Capsule Services, and limited coaching enables eligible organizations in North America to get started with Elevate and other products. Nonprofits and education institutions can skill up through additional self-learning trails with 80 modules and projects developed by Salesforce.org available on Trailhead.And with continued free and discounted access to NPSP, eligible nonprofit organizations can use data to understand, personalize, and engage their constituents at scale.
“We know that access to technology can be one of the greatest tools for change; a way for nonprofits and education institutions to fundamentally change how they advance their missions,” said David Ragones, SVP and General Manager of Salesforce.org Nonprofit Cloud. “Adding these new capabilities to the Power of Us program is one step forward in breaking down barriers and creating a stronger, more equitable platform to help power Salesforce.org’s community purpose.” 
Reimagining operating systems to combat rising rates of food insecurity
The UC Davis Food Pantry (The Pantry) – a Power of Us program participant – is one of many organizations that transformed their impact with better access to technology during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Even before the pandemic, many students at UC Davis were struggling to purchase food, with over 40% of students experiencing food insecurity. When the pandemic hit, problems only got worse, causing many students to make the tough decision between paying for tuition or food. 
“We quickly recognized that to meet student demands, we needed to improve inventory management and tracking at The Pantry,” explained Bryce Jacobs, UC Davis student and The Pantry’s Technical Projects Manager. “This meant adopting a fully digital solution so The Pantry could understand in real time what we needed, how much, and when.” 
Working with a team of Salesforce pro bono volunteers and through the Power of Us technology donation program, a group of students built an inventory management system with the Salesforce.org Nonprofit Success Pack, enabling The Pantry to tackle challenges better than ever before. 
After implementing the solution in September 2020, The Pantry has also added hygiene products to its inventory and developed a platform for online ordering so students can purchase items ahead of time.

Enhancing fundraising capabilities to help families experiencing homelessness
Another Power of Us organization, LA Family Housing (LAFH), saw a surge in demand for housing during the pandemic. The local community quickly responded to growing needs, doubling donations in 2020. But soon after, the LAFH gift processing team became overwhelmed with manual entries and was unable to keep up with the donations coming in.  
LAFH needed to adjust their support services — and fast.
“While we had already started to digitize our processes before the pandemic, we knew our current model wasn’t sustainable to support current donation rates,” said Lelan Fernando, Individual Giving Manager for LAFH. “We decided to integrate Elevate into our existing solutions that were made available through the Power of Us program. The integration of these products enabled us to harness the energy of our donors –where we raised over $1 million in a single virtual fundraiser – and funneling it toward causes our community desperately needed.” 
Upgrading manual processes to reduce isolation
Age UK and its network of affiliate chapters is a nonprofit that provides older adults with health services, wellbeing support, and a community they can rely on. 
While the pandemic caused many people to experience severe levels of isolation, the Age UK community was disproportionately affected as a result of social distancing and lockdowns. Age UK Hythe & Lyminge, a regional chapter of Age UK, quickly realized they needed a digital system to stay connected with their community and support their needs. 
With the Power of Us and Salesforce Pro Bono program, Age UK Hythe & Lyminge deployed a suite of Salesforce solutions to centralize contact details from lists provided by local health centers, create a flow-based script for volunteers to make calls and automate follow-up tasks, and effectively report insights to stakeholders. 
“By automating many of our manual processes, our volunteers were able to make 18,000 wellness check calls to isolated seniors at the height of the pandemic,” said Cleo Smith, Chief Executive Officer of Age UK Hythe & Leminge. “Technology enabled us to meet community needs and scale in ways we couldn’t have imagined before.”
Breaking barriers to technology 
From striving for zero hunger to creating a place to call home for everyone, technology can help nonprofits and educational institutions make change every day.  
The UC Davis Food Pantry, LA Family Housing, and Age UK are just a few examples of what happens when power is shifted from the few to the many, breaking critical barriers to access. 
Through newly expanded access to the Power of Us program, Salesforce.org aims to work side-by-side with organizations to deepen its impact in the nonprofit and education community for the next 20 years (and beyond).
 Sign up for the Power of Us program and explore how equal access to technology can power nonprofits.
*Elevate Power of Us Edition is eligible for only U.S. customers. Transaction fees are based on the amount of funds raised, unless the donor chooses to offset them through the Donor Cover feature. Organizations outside the U.S. have the power of the Salesforce.org ecosystem.

67,"November 15, 2021",Announcing New Gender Inclusive Benefits for Salesforce Employees,"

Salesforce partners with its LGBTQ+ community to provide transgender and non-binary employees with financial and emotional support including paid-leave, wardrobe, and legal fee reimbursements
At Salesforce, Equality is a core value which means we are intentional about taking the time to recognize, honor, and address our communities still fighting for equality today. This week is Transgender Awareness Week, an important time to elevate the transgender community and the very real challenges they face today, while also taking action.
Around the world, transgender people face systemic barriers and inequality — including access to healthcare. At Salesforce we want to do our part to remove as many barriers as possible to ensure our transgender and non-binary employees can get the care they need and live as their true, authentic selves.
Today, we are proud to announce new global Gender Inclusive Benefits to provide transgender and non-binary employees with the critical financial and emotional support they deserve.
After listening deeply to our LGBTQ+ community and consulting with Outforce, we went to work on a set of safe and accessible new benefits to support the unique needs of our global transgender and non-binary community. These new benefits will build on medical coverage and other resources we currently provide in the United States, deepening and extending support to all global employees, including:
Gender Affirmation Medical Reimbursement: We are now extending our reimbursement globally — providing financial support to employees going through gender affirmation medical procedures and treatments. This includes comprehensive coverage for surgeries, prescription drugs, hormonal therapy, hair transplant and removal, and more.Gender Affirmation Leave: We’re providing four weeks of paid leave for employees to take the time they need to recover after gender affirmation procedures.Wardrobe Reimbursement: We will provide up to $500 for employees who are affirming their gender to help them look and feel their best.Legal Fee Reimbursement: We’ll provide up to $1,000 to help employees navigate the legal hurdles of legally confirming their gender and updating government-issued IDs.Counseling Services: We’ll support transgender and non-binary employees and their loved ones with mental health services and counseling along each step of their journey.Warmline Support: We’re scaling Warmline, an employee advocacy program, to provide LGBTQ+ employees with a safe space for confidential conversations with advocates focused on belonging, equity, and career navigation.
At Salesforce, we believe everyone deserves to be who they are — and that doing so makes each of us the happiest and healthiest version of ourselves. We’re working hard to build a culture that makes everyone feel safe, valued, seen, and heard and believe these new benefits are an important step on that journey.
These Gender Inclusive Benefits are now available to all Salesforce employees. Previously, gender affirmation coverage and leave were only offered to U.S. employees. Learn more about Salesforce’s commitment to equality and how we’re implementing LGBTQ+ inclusive policies, practices, and benefits to support our communities.

68,"November 15, 2021","Salesforce Gives $10,000 Grants to 87 San Francisco Small Businesses","

As part of a Salesforce fund established to combat the impact of COVID-19, grants were distributed to a diverse group of businesses from neighborhoods across the city 
Today, Salesforce announced it has distributed $870,000 in grants as part of the 2021 Salesforce San Francisco Small Business Grants program. The $1 million fund, announced in September, provides support for San Francisco small businesses impacted by the continued emphasis on virtual work and events resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Grant recipients were selected from diverse industries and neighborhoods, showcasing the strong, vibrant local business community in the city Salesforce calls home.
“The success of our small businesses is in part closely tied to the well-being of our communities,” said Ebony Beckwith, Chief Philanthropy Officer, Salesforce. “I’m excited about this grant program because it supports an equitable recovery through the pandemic, and deepens our ongoing investment in diverse local entrepreneurs.”
This is the second time that Salesforce has sponsored a grant program specifically for San Francisco small businesses. This year’s grants were distributed to 87 small businesses, with grantees made up of 54% women, 28% Black or African American, 28% Hispanic, 38% Asian, and 9% LGBTQ+-owned businesses. Recipients included a broad range of industries, most prominently restaurants and bars, retail, professional services, personal services, and healthcare.
“Small businesses have remained integral to the communities they serve, even throughout the pandemic,” said Enrique Ortegon, SVP, SMB, Salesforce. “As part of the San Francisco community, Salesforce is proud to give back to small businesses in our own backyard through this grant program.”

69,"November 11, 2021","Salesforce to Upskill 80K Veterans, Donates $1M to Veterans, Education & Workforce Innovation Orgs","

New Salesforce survey shows that 86% of people in the U.S. say military veterans make companies stronger
Every year, thousands of veterans leave the military with unique experiences and the desire to serve in fulfilling roles in the private sector. Veterans and military spouses offer skills that can make them exemplary employees, such as a proven ability to learn new trades and concepts. Yet, many face obstacles to employment because they often have challenges converting skills gained in the military to private sector jobs. 
At Salesforce, we’re committed to investing in the workforce of the future through our diverse set of programs, which are focused on training, reskilling, and hiring people for the technology jobs of tomorrow.
That’s why we’re proud to announce that Salesforce is doubling our commitment to military Trailblazers by increasing our training goal from 40,000 veterans and military spouses to 80,000 over the next five years, and continuing to help them connect with companies and partners in the Salesforce ecosystem. 
In addition to doubling our training commitment, and in honor of General Colin Powell’s service to our country, Salesforce is also donating $1 million to organizations focused on workforce development, education, and veterans. General Powell had a foundational impact on Salesforce as a mentor to our Chairman & CEO Marc Benioff, and as a member of our Board of Directors.
Salesforce survey shows that people value having veterans in the workforce
We’re also releasing new insights from a Salesforce survey of more than 2,000 U.S. respondents that shows:
The overwhelming majority of people in the U.S. say military veterans are valuable to the workplace (91%) and make companies stronger (86%).Most respondents say hiring military veterans is part of creating an inclusive culture at work (84%), and a large majority (86%) say it is an important part of a company’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).But 2 in 3 (65%) say that most companies are not prepared to successfully attract, hire, and retain military veterans.

Salesforce Military upskills, reskills veterans and active-duty military spouses
Workforce development is a natural extension of Salesforce’s values. We want to empower a diverse and qualified workforce with the skills needed for the 21st Century to ensure their future success.
Six years ago, we started Salesforce Military, a free program committed to upskilling military community members by offering one single certification for Salesforce Administrator roles. Those initial veteran training classes sparked a thriving Salesforce Military community that continues to grow today. Today, veterans, reservists, and active-duty military spouses are tackling Salesforce certifications for every cloud and industry, and successfully rising through the ranks at their companies. 
Since then, Salesforce Military has upskilled and reskilled a growing community of military Trailblazers with high-demand technology skills and certifications, and helped them launch careers through the Salesforce Talent Alliance. The Salesforce Talent Alliance consists of 700+ companies around the world that have pledged inclusive hiring practices and devoting 20% of their hiring to net new talent. 
Existing military skills combined with Salesforce certifications can qualify a veteran for a job with an average starting salary of $87,000 annually. Since 2020, our investment of $2.2 million in the Salesforce Military Fellowship Program to help provide work to unemployed veterans and military spouses, has yielded the equivalent of $9.3 million in annual salaries for veterans and military spouses.
That includes Military Trailblazers like Army veteran Kyle Morris, who founded his own company, Kicksaw, and is now part of the Talent Alliance which hires military talent to drive its companies growth. It also includes Air Force veteran Janelle Fields, who leveraged the Salesforce Military Fellowship Program to land a full-time software engineer role at USAA. Both Kyle and Janelle are examples of how military veterans have built fulfilling careers in technology through Salesforce Military.

How customers and partners can access a diverse pool of military talent
We believe in building a workforce that better represents society — not just internally but through our partners and customers.
With our partners and customers at our side, we’re prepared for a more thriving future built from the expertise and passion of diverse military Trailblazers. The Salesforce Talent Alliance helps connect employers to Salesforce candidates and brings new talent, including military community members, into the ecosystem, emphasizing building a diverse workforce that reflects society around the globe.
This is why Salesforce is investing in the military community by doubling our commitment and supporting organizations focused on workforce development, education, and veterans. Those who have taken the leap and blazed new trails with us have helped us write a playbook for success that we want to keep driving forward to train and place more talented veterans in the Salesforce ecosystem. 
Whether you’re a hiring company or a veteran — we welcome you to join us in this journey to create a more diverse and inclusive workforce.

70,"November 4, 2021","64% of U.S., U.K. Adults Say Governments Should Require Emissions Targets","

Editor’s Note: This article references Salesforce Sustainability Cloud, which is now known as Net Zero Cloud. For the latest on Salesforce’s sustainability solutions, check out this product page. For the latest news on Salesforce’s sustainability efforts, check out this page.
Salesforce research reveals people expect significant climate action from businesses and governments.
On December 12, 2015, 195 countries committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions and limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This critical pledge took place at COP21, the site of the landmark Paris Agreement. 
Fast forward to 2021, at the U.N. Climate Change Conference (COP26), where the world is now  seeking even bigger and bolder actions. 
This week in Glasgow, international leaders are pledging to accelerate their efforts in the fight against climate change. The stakes for these leaders are high, however, with a new Salesforce survey showing that the majority of U.S. and U.K. respondents expect both business and government to make pledges to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. 
Governments and businesses must step up their efforts
Support for laws and regulations that fight catastrophic climate change enjoy wide support by the general public — and global leaders are taking note. In fact, according to the Salesforce survey, nearly seven in 10 (69%) of U.S. and U.K. adults believe governments should prioritize climate policy; and 64% of U.S. and U.K. adults say emissions targets should be mandated by law. 


For example, Salesforce has publicly supported the climate investments outlined in the proposed U.S. budget reconciliation package. These include the robust investment in coastal restoration and resilience projects that would create jobs and help sequester carbon, all while protecting coastal communities from the escalating climate crisis and the REPLANT Act, bipartisan legislation which would put 1.2 billion trees in the ground to help fight climate change and create 49,000 jobs in the process. 
In addition, Salesforce has also codified its commitment to climate advocacy by officially including climate as part of the company’s public policy platform, joining other priorities like security, privacy and human rights; and has called for mandatory climate disclosures, stating that companies should be required to publicly disclose their carbon emissions. 
Businesses must expand sustainability actions outside of their four walls
The Salesforce survey also shows 73% of respondents agreeing that emissions reductions should be factored into business strategy and operating models. Salesforce, for example, has been on a sustainability journey for over a decade to reach climate milestones such as achieving Net Zero and 100% renewable energy, and is pushing suppliers to ramp up their climate efforts by setting their own science-based targets. 
What’s more, according to the Salesforce survey, businesses engaging in climate advocacy have the support of nearly two-thirds of the US and UK population.
How Salesforce is leveraging technology to drive climate action
Sixty-nine percent of survey respondents also say that every company should leverage technology to track and reduce emissions. 

Salesforce continually looks for ways to innovate when it comes to carbon emissions reporting — for example, looking at how Salesforce’s carbon accounting process could be improved to deliver faster, better, and more accurate data.
The result was Sustainability Cloud, a Salesforce-built product that reduced a six-month reporting process to only six weeks. With Sustainability Cloud, companies big and small and across all industries can now track their carbon emissions and take meaningful climate action. 
A 1.5°C future requires a global effort 
Salesforce recognizes this is only the beginning of its own sustainability journey. There is more work to do to broaden its impact and inspire others to join and step up to the urgent challenge of climate change. 
At COP26, leaders across industries and governments will be encouraged to use their platforms as strong voices for climate action, both by reducing their own impact and by using their voice to advocate for a more just, Net Zero future.

71,"November 4, 2021",Salesforce Trade Promotion Management Innovations Help Grow CPG Revenues Amid Supply Chain Disruptions,"

Quick Take: Today Salesforce announced new innovations in Consumer Goods Cloud to better manage promotion and retail execution for consumer goods brands. Trade Promotion Management streamlines promotions planning, breaking down silos and creating a single source of truth that helps maximize trade spend effectiveness. And with a new mobile offline retail execution app, field reps can complete store visit activities while offline from their mobile device.
These new capabilities, along with the current product innovations in Consumer Goods Cloud, provide a complete solution for the most complex needs of the largest consumer goods companies in the world to better engage customers and drive revenue. 
Driving the news: Consumer goods companies spend on average up to 20% of their revenue on trade spend, equating to about $400 billion dollars per year across the industry. However, two-thirds of promotions fail to break even and upwards of $100 billion is lost to inefficient in-store and trade execution. Those inefficiencies have been amplified  with the cost of goods on the rise and supply chain disruptions.  In addition, many consumer goods companies are using outdated technology and manual spreadsheets to manage this process1. 
New capabilities in Consumer Goods Cloud allow brands to plan, execute and optimize trade spend with a single source of truth.

Key Account and Promotion Planning allows account managers to maximize trade spend effectiveness by efficiently managing customer business plans and account budgets. Sales teams now have stronger visibility to their account plans, allowing them to create and deploy the right promotion for their customers and help fuel revenue growth.Trade Promotion Analytics enables leaders to easily measure trade spend effectiveness and maximize promotional ROI, giving them more visibility to successful promotion tactics. This allows teams to replicate the highest performing promotions and eliminate promotions that fail to break-even.Funds and Claims Management provides account managers with clear visibility to trade budgets and accrued liabilities. This allows them to verify available funding to support their trade plans and match claims with payment once the promotion has finished.Unified Account View strengthens cross-functional alignment with a unified account view across media, merchandising and trade. This allows teams to layer trade activity with national marketing campaigns and in-store programs to drive higher ROI for the promotion.

There’s more: Many brick-and-mortar retail outlets lack connectivity and Wi-Fi, presenting a problem for on-the-go reps who need to keep promotions data up to date. With Salesforce’s new offline retail execution mobile app in Consumer Goods Cloud, reps working on site can access offline data to complete tasks, manage order management, and pricing. Once the rep reconnects, the data is instantly synchronized.
The Salesforce perspective: “Consumer goods companies who effectively manage their promotional activities have more opportunities for growth in this new digital-first world,” said David Schmaier, Chief Product Officer, Salesforce. “However, many companies still rely on outdated software to help them manage these processes. Trade Promotion Management in Consumer Goods Cloud helps these companies unlock revenue growth while removing the silos between marketing, sales, and execution teams so they can better serve and grow their business with loyal customers.”

Editor’s Note: This article references Salesforce Sustainability Cloud, which is now known as Net Zero Cloud. For the latest on Salesforce’s sustainability solutions, check out this product page. For the latest news on Salesforce’s sustainability efforts, check out this page.
In line with the key initiatives laid out by COP26 — mitigation, adaptation, finance, and collaboration  — Salesforce is on an accelerated mission to support one of its largest stakeholders, the planet itself. 
Salesforce is a Net Zero company, and just last week, Marc and Lynne Benioff and Salesforce announced a $300 million investment to accelerate ecosystem restoration and climate justice. 
Salesforce has been on its sustainability transformation journey for over a decade, and has long been committed to setting ambitious climate targets and supporting cutting edge public policy to drive climate action. Climate is a key part of Salesforce’s public policy platform, and the company is committed to actively advocating for clear and consistent science-based climate policies that facilitate a just and equitable global transition to a 1.5°C future. 
As a COP26 partner, Salesforce will advocate for the conference’s key initiatives with insights and momentum gleaned from its own sustainability journey:
Mitigation — Secure global Net Zero by 2050 and keep 1.5°C future within reach:  
Salesforce has achieved Net Zero across its full value chain and has achieved 100% renewable energy for its operations. Salesforce developed emissions reductions strategies across Scope 1, 2, and 3, and has set a goal to reduce its scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions 50% by 2030 and near-zero by 2040.Salesforce Sustainability Cloud 2.0 was announced to help customers track and reduce emissions and take action through a full view of their environmental footprint with investor-grade data for customizable ESG reporting. When Sustainability Cloud was first introduced in 2019, Salesforce used to tool to cut its carbon accounting process from move than six months to just six weeks.Salesforce has implemented a Sustainability Exhibit as part of all standard procurement contracts with suppliers, requiring them to set science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and deliver products and services on a carbon-neutral basis.
Adaptation — Adapt to protect communities and natural habitats: 
Salesforce is a founding partner of 1T.org, and committed to its own goal of 100 million trees by the end of 2030. This year, the company met a critical milestone of 40 million trees funded in just two years since the goal was announced.  Salesforce announced two new, natural climate solutions: a global tree equity and urban reforestation initiative in partnership with American Forests, One Tree Planted, and SUGi; and a blue carbon program to protect and restore oceans and coastal ecosystems.Salesforce has implemented a Blackwater water recycling system in San Francisco’s Salesforce Tower. The first of its kind in San Francisco, the system saves 7.8 million gallons of drinking water annually.
Finance — Developed countries must keep to their promises in mobilizing at least $100 billion in climate finance per year by 2020:
Salesforce announced the issuance of an inaugural $1 billion sustainability bond — the first sustainability bond by a software company — to support investments in innovative projects that address global climate, equality, and other social challenges.Salesforce joined the governments of Norway, the UK, the United States and leading companies including Amazon, Airbnb, Nestlé, Unilever and others, as a founding partner of the LEAF Coalition, a new public-private coalition with the goal of mobilizing at least $1 billion in 2021 to protect tropical forests around the world.Salesforce called for mandatory climate disclosures, stating that companies should be required to publicly disclose independent third-party-reviewed emissions information, covering Scopes 1, 2, and 3 as well as emission reduction goals, and there must be a globally recognized and formally governed reporting standard. In addition, Salesforce released its first-ever Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report, which supplements its annual Stakeholder Impact Report.Salesforce Ventures launched its second $100 million Impact Fund to accelerate the growth of cloud companies addressing some of today’s most pressing needs, including climate action.
Collaboration — We can only rise to the challenges of the climate crisis by working together:
Salesforce co-founded UpLink, an open-source digital platform to foster mass participation from entrepreneurs around the world to meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. This year’s UpLink Trillion Trees Challenge, co-designed with 1T.org, was a global call for solutions to help meet the goal of conserving, restoring and growing a trillion trees over the next decade.Through Impact Labs, Salesforce is convening leading nonprofits and others across government, academia, and for-profit sectors to accelerate innovation and create new technology solutions that will contribute to a more sustainable future for all.
Salesforce, along with other corporates and environmental organizations, founded Business Alliance to Scale Climate Solutions to help improve and scale corporate climate solutions funding.Salesforce actively engages its 10K+ member employee resource group, Earthforce, dedicated to promoting and celebrating environmental responsibility at the company. Earthforce has a formal global leadership team comprised of nine leaders around the world in addition to 90+ local leaders.  Salesforce expanded its partnership with Accenture — the powerful combination of Accenture’s Sustainability Services, Salesforce Sustainability Cloud, and Salesforce Customer 360. It brings sustainability to the front office and provides the C-suite with true visibility into their company’s historical and real-time ESG data.
Salesforce is committed to the fight against climate change, and COP26 is an urgent moment for all — governments, investors, businesses, individuals — to work together in the effort to save our planet, protect vulnerable populations, and drive equality, while fueling economic growth, job creation, and a more sustainable world.

73,"October 29, 2021","Rocket Mortgage Unveils Partnership with Salesforce, Providing Transformational Mortgage Services to Financial Institutions","

Rocket Mortgage, a leading mortgage lender, today announced a partnership with Salesforce to make the company’s mortgage origination technology available to banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions nationwide through Salesforce Financial Services Cloud.
The market opportunity is significant, with nearly 5,000 FDIC-insured banks and more than 5,000 credit unions in the United States. While some of these institutions have highly specialized mortgage operations, most have disparate partners and technology vendors that handle home loans for them. Through the new partnership, Rocket Mortgage plans to deploy its technology in Salesforce Financial Services Cloud regardless of how the financial institution chooses to offer mortgages, simplifying a potentially fragmented process.
“We’re incredibly proud to expand our partnership with Jay Farner and his team at Rocket Mortgage with new innovations for the financial services industry,” said Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO, Salesforce. “Together, we are reimagining the mortgage experience for a digital-first and trust-first world, transforming the home buying process for thousands of financial institutions and their customers.”

74,"October 28, 2021",Salesforce Field Service Unveils New Tools to Empower a Modern Mobile Workforce,"

Today, Salesforce introduced four new capabilities for Field Service to help businesses equip their mobile workforce for the future. These features will enable businesses to scale field service resources to handle more complex jobs, customize mobile workflows to improve employee experiences, provide customers with self-service scheduling, and use video to troubleshoot issues in real time.
Customers today expect businesses to deliver world-class service whether they’re working with a call center employee, engaging with a bot, or interacting with an agent in the field. But field service organizations often don’t have the tools, skills, and information to meet these expectations. In fact, 80% of field service professionals say the skills required for their job have changed from just two years ago.  
“With customers and employees looking for fast and easy service, the field service industry is ripe for change,” said Paul Whitelam, GM of Field Service Management at Salesforce. “Salesforce is continuing to evolve our field service management platform to meet the needs of customers and field service employees in this all-digital world, and these latest innovations bring more trust, speed, and convenience to every field service interaction.”
Lightning Web Components for Field Service will allow businesses and partners to easily customize the Salesforce Field Service mobile app with advanced features and workflows to provide a better technician experience.
Enhanced Scheduling and Optimization Engine will enable businesses to handle more complex field service jobs, as well as highlight problems and suggest fixes for scheduling conflicts.
Appointment Assistant Self-Service Scheduling enables customers to schedule, cancel, confirm, or reschedule their own appointments.
Visual Remote Assistant Two-Way Video lets both agents and customers collaborate over video in real-time to troubleshoot issues.

Field service is built for change
Salesforce Field Service was built to manage mobile workforces on the world’s #1 CRM. It offers a complete service offering that connects customer data and service experts on one platform. Salesforce Field Service also provides intelligent scheduling, virtual support, and visual assistance to solve problems efficiently and reduce costs. In addition, an integration with Slack enables swarming capabilities and collaboration with the right experts, based on availability and skills. 
Today’s additions to Salesforce Field Service include:
Enhanced Scheduling and Optimization Engine will enable businesses to handle more complex field service jobs that require several steps and technicians. For example, a utility job includes digging a hole for a new electric pole, installing the pole and wires, and adding wiring to nearby structures. Companies will be able to chain these steps together so dispatchers can see complex jobs in their entirety and better manage worker capacity. The enhanced engine will run on Hyperforce, a reimagination of Salesforce’s platform architecture built to securely and reliably deliver the Salesforce Customer 360, including Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Commerce Cloud, Industries and more, on major public clouds. Lightning Web Components for Field Service will allow businesses and partners to easily customize the Salesforce Field Service mobile app with advanced features and workflows to provide a better technician experience. For example, a water delivery company can create a custom app with order information from Service Cloud in one page, automating the documentation process and saving the delivery person time and clicks. An insurance company may require different customizations for natural disaster claims like hurricanes or earthquakes based on the different regions in which they operate. Lightning Web Components also provide new opportunities for partners and system integrators to create industry-specific applications, such as streamlined workflows for home security companies or industrial manufacturers. Appointment Assistant Self-Service Scheduling enables customers to schedule, cancel, confirm, or reschedule their own appointments, all without waiting on hold. And as customers make these changes, technician schedules and service resources automatically adjust for the new schedule. Visual Remote Assistant Two-Way Video lets both agents and customers collaborate over video in real-time to troubleshoot issues. This can be used as a triage step, automatically triggered based on the characteristics of a support ticket, to avoid unnecessary and expensive truck rolls. For example, an agent can show a customer step by step how to reset their own cable box. Additionally, when on-site, technicians can get real-time training or pull in additional support from co-workers when needed.
Organizations are using Salesforce Field Service to respond faster and build trust
Organizations in dozens of industries around the world are using Salesforce Field Service to respond to the changing needs of their customers:
Hologic: “With Salesforce Field Service, Hologic is able to reduce time spent on-site by equipping field service engineers with AI-powered recommendations and ensure we can get the right person to the right job at the right time, with the right part,” Pierre Malboeuf, Senior Director, National Field Service, Breast & Skeletal Health, Hologic. “Field Service is a game changer and enables us to build a deep sense of trust with our customers.” AAA: “Today’s consumer has zero tolerance for having to repeat themselves. Omnichannel servicing allows a customer to begin a request or service from one chosen channel and complete the request in a whole other service channel without losing a beat,” Shohreh Abedi, EVP, Chief Operations Technology Officer, Member Experience, The Auto Club Group – AAA. “Field Service has reduced over 25% of the volume that is being handled completely digitally without human interaction, through AI, chat or other digital self-service capabilities. The result of having a customer-centric approach is a happier, more delighted member, and Salesforce is a big part of our journey.”SafeStreets: “We needed a smart tool that would allow us to schedule security installs quickly in a matter of minutes and bring our reschedule rate down, because rescheduling often results in the customer cancelling the job,” said Eddie Prignano, VP of Systems Architecture, SafeStreets. “Salesforce helped us create a great customer experience in a short amount of time that gives us confidence in our scheduling and gives the customer all the information they could want — from the name and photo of the technician, to where they are and their ETA, so the customer never feels like they’re in the dark. And as customers’ expectations require updates to these experiences, we have the flexibility to simply and easily make changes as necessary.” MTI: “MTI provides security and tablet solutions to businesses like retailers, restaurants, hotels and hospitals, and the pandemic drove tremendous change in all of those businesses. By leveraging Salesforce Field Service, we’ve been able to reduce manual scheduling needs by 50% and run 70-80% of service trips through our optimization model,” Mary Jesse, CEO, MTI. “Not only that, but we’re able to drill down and see to the minute when somebody is on-site, what they’re doing and how it relates back up to a complete customer project. The average time to resolve a case has decreased as we’ve leveraged multiple applications within the Salesforce ecosystem — increasing the speed and efficiency of our business.”
DocuSign automates contract obligations in the field
Announced yesterday, DocuSign CLM for Field Service will allow customers to automate how they track, enforce, and update contract terms across departments and while in the field.

75,"October 28, 2021","Salesforce Accelerates Fight Against Climate Change with New Trees, Oceans, and Youth Programs","

New tree equity and global urban reforestation initiative engages youth and ecopreneurs to grow urban forests and green cities across Canada, Europe, India, South Africa, and the United States
The company also announced a blue carbon program and a goal to purchase 1 million tons of blue carbon credits over four years
Just ahead of COP26, the UN climate change conference in Glasgow, Salesforce has announced two new, natural climate solutions: a global tree equity and urban reforestation initiative in partnership with American Forests, One Tree Planted, and SUGi; and a blue carbon program to protect and restore oceans and coastal ecosystems. In addition, Marc and Lynne Benioff and Salesforce announced a $300 million investment to accelerate 1T.org — a global movement to restore, conserve and grow one trillion trees by 2030—and advance climate justice initiatives.  
Tree equity is defined as having enough trees and green canopy in a specific area or region so everyone can experience the health, climate, and economic benefits that trees provide. Neighborhoods lacking in trees can be 5 to 7 degrees hotter, and some as much as 22 degrees hotter than neighborhoods with sufficient tree cover. 
Salesforce’s tree equity and urban reforestation initiative aims to mobilize and engage ecopreneurs, local organizations and volunteers, including Salesforce employees, in cities across Canada, Europe, India, South Africa, and the United States with limited access to green spaces. 
“Trees are one of the most powerful green infrastructure solutions we have to fight climate change, advance equity, and create tangible benefits for all people,” said Suzanne DiBianca, EVP Corporate Relations and Chief Impact Officer, Salesforce. “We’re proud to apply our resources to make cities greener and healthier for vulnerable communities around the world, help reduce absolute emissions, and support ecopreneurs who are creating innovative solutions to advance climate justice.”

“In partnership with bold leaders like Salesforce, we are beginning to right this wrong,” said Jad Daley, president and chief executive officer of American Forests. “Through our tool, Tree Equity Score, we can identify the neighborhoods with vulnerable populations that need trees the most. This creates a roadmap for public and private investment for tree planting and protection in places that urgently need the benefits trees provide.”

Salesforce’s investments in nature solutions like trees and oceans, help deliver on the company’s goal to conserve, restore and grow 100 million trees by 2030, and builds on our Net Zero and other climate strategies to reduce emissions as outlined in our Climate Action Plan. 

Tree equity initiative focuses on climate justice and curbing climate change
Trees are a powerful infrastructure solution — they help cool air temperatures, can create jobs, and are incredible purifiers that extract carbon from the air. Projects will start this year through the end of 2022:
Canada: Working with four local schools, youth will learn about the historical roots of environmental justice and how trees are a solution for creating equity; and plant 720 large trees around the Claireville Dam Restoration Site in Toronto. Europe: Summers in Europe are becoming increasingly hot due to climate change. Microforests will be established in Paris, Glasgow, and London. With the goal of 10,000+ trees, the project will engage youth and volunteers in planting events, including an ultra-biodiverse microforest in Paris that features over 24 native tree species. India: With the goal of planting 5,000 trees across Delhi, this project focuses on youth engagement at schools with hands-on tree planting events and in-classroom learning to inspire a new generation of ecopreneurs. South Africa: This ecopreneurship project will create one centralized school-based tree nursery and engage students in planting 5,000+ trees on school campuses across Johannesburg. Students will learn about the nursery business model and how to plant and grow trees in a changing climate. United States: Efforts will focus in Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and, Pawtucket and Central Falls, Rhode Island — areas with low tree canopy that are experiencing extreme heat — and plant more than 1,700 trees across underserved communities.
Since announcing our goal of 100 million trees in 2020, Salesforce has funded more than 43 million trees in less than two years. 
Salesforce envisions pathway for blue carbon market and mobilizes ecopreneurs
As part of Salesforce’s commitment to oceans, we’re launching a blue carbon program to conserve, protect, and restore coastal and marine ecosystems. This initiative will help develop the nascent blue carbon market, and includes a goal to purchase 1 million tons of high-quality blue carbon credits, equivalent to more than $10 million USD, over the next four years.
More than 3 billion people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods, and 80% of global fish populations depend on healthy mangrove ecosystems in order to thrive. Mangroves also provide more than $80 billion in flood protection benefits annually by stabilizing shorelines, preventing erosion, and protecting the land and people from sea level rise and extreme weather events. 
“Mangroves and other coastal and marine ecosystems are critical in the fight against climate change, and we need to do everything in our power to protect them,” said Dr. Whitney Johnston Ph.D., Director of Ocean Sustainability at Salesforce. “We are launching a blue carbon program at a time when it’s most critical for our planet. Coastal and ocean ecosystems deliver an outsized benefit in protecting our communities and marine life, they create jobs, and are essential for sustenance for millions of people around the world.”

Key actions of Salesforce’s blue carbon program 
Salesforce’s blue carbon program delivers on the company values and goals of equality and climate justice, carbon sequestration, and supporting ecopreneurs by focusing on these key areas:
Blue carbon market: Working through the Business Alliance to Scale Climate Solutions, we aim to mobilize, educate, and coordinate corporate buyers to conserve and restore blue carbon ecosystems through voluntary carbon markets. This work focuses on scaling the supply of high-quality blue carbon credits by improving policy and advancing equitable access to global carbon markets by local and indigenous communities.Policy: Nature plays a critical role in combating climate change, and that is why we support the coastal resilience and restoration investments proposed in the reconciliation package. As climate change and sea-level rise accelerate, extreme weather events are becoming more intense and frequent. We need policies in place that support robust investments in coastal restoration and resilience projects that protect communities, help sequester carbon, and also create good paying jobs. Ecopreneurs: Mobilizing ecopreneurs around the world through platforms like UpLink. UpLink’s challenges like the Ocean Finance, and the Blue Carbon Challenge launching at COP26, focus on mobilizing the right financing mechanisms for a sustainable management of the ocean. These are examples of how we can drive forward innovative ideas to grow the blue carbon market.

“It’s time to forge a new relationship with the ocean — one in which effective ocean protection and sustainable economic production and equitable prosperity go hand-in-hand,” said Kristian Teleki, Global Director, Ocean Programme, World Resources Institute and Director, Friends of Ocean Action, World Economic Forum. “I’m excited to see Salesforce demonstrate bold leadership by launching this new ocean sustainability program. This is precisely the type of transformative action and leadership we need to see more of from the business world.”
Mangroves are an important part of that effort. Salesforce has partnered with One Tree Planted to restore, conserve and grow 148,000 mangrove trees in the Osa Peninsula in Costa Rica. The project starts in the highland forests of the Talamanca Mountains, and extends through lowland tropical forests and grasslands, to coastal mangroves. The restoration work on land ultimately delivers improved water quality for the coral reefs in the sea. The ‘ridge-to-reef’ ecosystem connectivity enables species to adapt to climate change over time, and demonstrates a climate-forward, holistic conservation approach from land to sea.
Initiatives like these demonstrate how forests, communities and the ocean around the world are each interconnected, and that protecting them is paramount as we face the climate crisis. Everyone — governments, investors, businesses, individuals — must step up to this massive challenge and work together, today, to take action on climate.

$100 million Benioff TIME Tree Fund aims to accelerate the global reforestation efforts of 1T.org and help emerging and developing countries mitigate the increasing impacts of climate change
TIME Ventures will invest $100 million in ecopreneurs and reforestation ventures
Salesforce to give $100 million funding in grants, donate technology, and enable volunteers to deliver 2.5 million volunteer hours to nonprofits focused on climate action over the next 10 years
San Francisco — October 28, 2021 — Marc and Lynne Benioff today announced $200 million in new climate investments toward reforestation and restoration efforts—establishing the first-of-its-kind $100 million Benioff TIME Tree Fund and committing $100 million in investments from TIME Ventures, the Benioffs’ investment fund.
Salesforce to give $100 million funding in grants over the next 10 years to nonprofits working on ecosystem restoration and climate justice, donate technology through the Power of Us program, and enable volunteers to deliver 2.5 million volunteer hours to organizations focused on climate action.
“We’re in a planetary emergency—a climate crisis that impacts everyone, especially for the most vulnerable among us. More than half of global GDP is exposed to risk from the nature loss effects of climate change. And it will only get worse unless we collectively take bold steps now to limit global warming,” said Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO, Salesforce. “We need to apply every strategy possible to protect and preserve our planet. We must accelerate the world’s largest businesses to Net Zero as part of reducing global emissions by half by 2030; sequester 100 gigatons of carbon through restoring, conserving, and growing 1 trillion trees; and energize an ecopreneur revolution to develop new technologies that will expedite the path to a decarbonized planet. Every country, company, community, and person has a responsibility to act now—the cost of failing to address this global threat will be catastrophic. Our generation will be judged by the actions we take on climate change today.”

“What an amazing gift to Planet Earth! By protecting and restoring forests and planting trees, we can help slow down climate change and the loss of biodiversity,” said Dr. Jane Goodall, DBE. “We must stop deforestation—especially in tropical regions where old growth forests continue to be threatened by industrial agriculture. We must listen to the wisdom of the indigenous people who have lived in harmony with their forests for generations. We must bring trees into our cities so that people of all incomes can benefit from a green environment.”
“We need leaders in every sector of society to stand up and do the right thing for the climate. Youth around the world have been demanding governments and companies drastically reduce carbon emissions, focus on climate restoration, and increase their commitments to the Paris Agreement. We need to see more climate leadership like Marc Benioff and Salesforce, who have already achieved net zero and 100% renewable energy. But there’s still more to do. Business leaders have a responsibility to influence other business leaders to take climate action. The future of my generation and the generations that follow depends on it!” said Alexandria Villaseñor, co-founder of U.S. Youth Climate Strike and founder of Earth Uprising.

The Benioff TIME Tree Fund
The Benioff TIME Tree Fund will focus on indigenous and community-based forest management and mitigating the increasing impacts of climate change on the most at-risk communities and natural ecosystems in emerging and developing countries. The Benioff TIME Tree Fund builds on the Benioffs’ ongoing efforts to slow the effects of climate change and preserve a better world for future generations. Since 2016, the Benioffs have given $68 million in climate-related grants.
In January 2020, the Benioffs contributed the initial financial support to establish 1t.org, a global movement with the goal to conserve, restore, and grow 1 trillion trees by the end of the decade. In 2016, the Benioffs donated $10 million to the University of California Santa Barbara and founded the Benioff Ocean Initiative, a science-based organization that links changemakers together to bring ocean solutions to life. To date, the Benioff Ocean Initiative has funded dozens of projects, including new technologies that capture plastic in rivers all over the world before that plastic reaches the ocean, and Whale Safe, AI-powered, whale-detection technology that helps ship captains avoid striking and killing whales—and in so doing aids in the fight against climate change.
To ensure the preservation of our oceans, the Benioffs partnered with National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to form the Pacific Islands Research and Conservation program in 2017. They are also founding members of the World Economic Forum (WEF)’s Friends of Ocean Action initiative, providing nearly $11 million in funding through the Benioff Ocean Initiative.
TIME Ventures
Every day, ecopreneurs—entrepreneurs dedicated to protecting the planet—are launching new innovations to reduce emissions, sequester carbon, and repair and protect natural resources. With today’s announcement, the Benioffs will commit another $100 million from TIME Ventures to continue to fund the ecopreneur revolution. Since 2014, the Benioffs have invested $100 million in ecopreneurs, including climate-focused startups like DroneSeed, Loam Bio, Mango Materials, NCX, Novoloop, Planet, Terraformation, and others.
Salesforce Climate Action Plan
Salesforce is a Net Zero company across its full value chain and has achieved 100% renewable energy for its operations. The company is a founder of 1t.org and has already funded more than 40 million trees toward its 100 million tree goal, and is a member of the UN’s Race to Zero and the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.
Salesforce has been on its sustainability journey for more than a decade. Executing on a comprehensive Climate Action Plan, the company is helping drive toward a 1.5 degree future by focusing on six sustainability priorities: emissions reduction, carbon removal, trillion trees & ecosystem restoration, education & mobilization, innovation, and regulation & policy. As part of Salesforce’s Net Zero journey, it is prioritizing reducing emissions as quickly as possible and aligning its own full value chain emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3) to the global trajectory of ~50% emissions reductions by 2030, and near-zero emissions by 2040.
With its Sustainability Cloud 2.0, Salesforce is supercharging its efforts to help accelerate the world’s largest businesses to Net Zero, faster. Sustainability Cloud is designed to help customers track and reduce their emissions and take impactful action on climate.
Salesforce is on an accelerated mission leveraging its full power to create a more sustainable and equitable future for all.

79,"October 11, 2021",Meet the Youth Ecopreneurs Who Will Shape #GenerationRestoration,"

Salesforce, in partnership with the World Economic Forum’s 1t.org (Trillion Trees Initiative) and the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (UN Decade), recently launched the UpLink Generation Restoration Youth Challenge, a global call for youth-led solutions to conserve and restore ecosystems in support of one of humanity’s greatest challenges — climate change. 
From hurricanes in the United States, to devastating fires in Turkey, to floods in Europe, to the droughts in Argentina, there has never been a more urgent time to heal our planet. UN Decade aims to help prevent, halt, and reverse the degradation of ecosystems on every continent and in every ocean, but this lofty goal will only be achieved if everyone plays their part.
Using the UpLink platform, the youth challenge invited submissions covering conservation and restoration of intact and degraded terrestrial and coastal ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, peat, and more. 
Salesforce and its partners then reviewed submissions from ecopreneurs and in particular, Generation Restoration change-makers, taking action in these three areas identified in the challenge:
Successful examples of ecopreneurshipCapacity-building for youthAdvocacy, inspiration, and engagement
What is “Generation Restoration”?
Today, there is a new generation of youth entrepreneurs known as “Generation Restoration,” who are putting the planet’s health first and demonstrating the power of an environmentally-savvy generation to bring about real, concrete change towards a healthy and sustainable planet. 
This generation is largely made up of Gen Z youth. A 2021 Pew Research (1) report found that Gen Z is overwhelmingly worried about climate change: 76% say that it’s one of their biggest societal concerns, while 37% see it as their number one concern.
What’s more, these young adults believe more in themselves than any other actor — government, leadership, or business — to lead the way to change. In a recent study conducted by The Youth Change Makers Report, when asked who will lead the change towards a more sustainable future, the most common answer was “young people” (37%). Only 10% reported considering adults as capable of making the necessary changes, while only 13% said they believe in companies’ capabilities (2). 
How Salesforce aims to support Generation Restoration
Salesforce is committed to building a more sustainable future for all, having identified the environment as a key stakeholder for the company, and by harnessing innovation to improve the state of the world. 
Through that innovation, UpLink was born. Salesforce’s UpLink platform empowers a new generation of social entrepreneurs for mass mobilization — bringing people together so they can collaborate, develop high-impact solutions, and meet Sustainable Development Goals for a better, safer, and healthier world. 
“With UpLink, we’re able to empower and inspire a new generation of change-makers who are leading the climate restoration movement. To be able to connect ecopreneurs to a broader community that can help shape climate innovation is truly something extraordinary,” said Natalia Latimer, VP of Strategic Partnerships, Salesforce.
Announcing the Generation Restoration Youth Challenge Spotlight Award winners
As part of the youth challenge, 1t.org and Salesforce recently announced four Youth Challenge Spotlight Award winners:
Seawater solutions 
A multiple-award-winning startup based in Glasgow which focuses on coastlines. The founders focus on taking two of the world’s most abundant resources — degraded land and seawater — and build wetlands that capture carbon, create jobs, and produce food, as well as improve and stabilize the coastline. They started in 2017, and in just four short years have launched wetland farms in Ghana, Vietnam, and Bangladesh, and in 2021, planted more than 100,000 mangroves in Ghana. 
Treeeconomy
Founded by two students, Treeconomy is an impact-driven startup on a mission to revolutionize forestry-based carbon offsetting. The team has pioneered an integrated suite of remote-sensing, data science, and green finance tools to address the fundamental financial barriers that oppose reforestation at the landowner level. Since its inception, they have evacuated over 300 tons of water, produced 50 tons of biochar, and dispatched over 35 tons of nutrients, sequestering 10,500 tons of carbon overall.
Green Generation Initiative 
Green Generation Initiative nurtures young people to become environmentally conscious at a young age. Through education, greening schools, creating food forest establishments, and adopt-a-tree campaigns, the initiative is creating a nature-first culture in the minds of youth in Kenya. Green Generation Initiative has reached over seven countries and impacted over 20,000 students; currently operating in 35 schools, they’ve planted over 30,000 tree seedlings through their ‘Adopt a Tree’ Campaign. 
A full list of youth challenge winners can be found below.

The 14 best submissions have been invited to a four-month accelerator program facilitated by the World Economic Forum and its partners to help the winners gain visibility, attract partners and funding, and scale their solutions to accelerate their impact.

82,"September 30, 2021",Salesforce Recognized as a Leader in the 2021 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Enterprise Low-Code Application Platforms,"

Salesforce, the global leader in CRM, today announced it has once again been named a Leader by Gartner Inc. in its 2021 Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Low-Code Application Platforms. 
At a time when the world has shifted to an all-digital, work-from-anywhere model, Salesforce Platform has enabled companies to click, create, and ship apps from anywhere with its suite of low-code and developer tools, and enterprise services.

83,"September 29, 2021",Consumers Expected to Face Higher Prices this Holiday Season — Salesforce Digital Forecast,"

Global online sales predicted to grow 7% year-over-year following historic 2020 holiday shopping season 
Consumer prices projected to rise up to 20% this holiday season 
U.S. retailers are expected to face an extra $223 billion in costs of goods sold due to manufacturing capacity, logistics costs, and labor shortage
Packages at risk for delay this year projected to be down 94% as retailers improve logistics and build out curbside pickup capabilities 
SAN FRANCISCO—September 29, 2021—Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), the global leader in CRM, today announced new consumer insights and predictions for the 2021 holiday shopping season. The company expects digital sales to once again top $1 trillion globally, but consumers, retailers, and suppliers are predicted to face rising costs and decreased inventory due to pressure on the global supply chain.
While online sales growth is expected to be moderate compared to last year’s historic 50% surge and more in line with pre-pandemic growth trends, digital shopping habits formed during the pandemic will persist and drive total sales to record rates for this holiday season. Salesforce forecasts: 
7% year-over-year overall growth in global digital commerce for November and December (slowing down from 50% year-over-year growth in 2020) and 10% growth in the U.S. (slowing down from 43% year-over-year growth in 2020) Total digital sales are expected to reach a record high of $1.2 trillion globally and  $259 billion in the U.S. Digital commerce growth will be driven by a 20% rise in consumer prices despite fewer global (-2%) and U.S. (-4%) holiday orders expected 
“While last holiday was defined by the last mile, this year is expected to be dominated by the first mile,” said Rob Garf, VP and GM of Retail, Salesforce. “With persistent global supply chain disruptions, retailers must draw consumers to their online and physical stores early in the season to fulfill demand and capture holiday spending.”
As retailers and consumers grapple with the challenges of the ongoing pandemic for a second straight holiday season, Salesforce predicts:
Retailers, suppliers, and consumers will bear the burden of rising costs
Increased costs appear to be front and center this year for retailers, suppliers, and consumers — for a multitude of reasons.
Retailers and suppliers: Three key forces that have exerted significant pressure on the global supply chain are: manufacturing capacity, logistics costs, and the labor shortage. In total, Salesforce predicts that the retail industry in the U.S. will face an extra $223 billion in the cost of goods sold this holiday season.Consumers: With inventory issues and higher costs fueling inflation and cutting into margins, expect to see higher retail prices for merchandise. In fact, Salesforce projects consumers will see a 20% rise in prices during the holiday and beyond. As consumers contend with these higher prices, global “buy now, pay later’’ usage will likely account for 8% ($96B globally and $20B in the U.S.) of online orders this holiday season, up from 4% of orders during the 2020 holiday season. 
Product availability takes over shipping delays as this holiday’s spoiler
One of last year’s biggest challenges was fulfillment delays to consumers’ doorstep. While concerns persist this year, it is much less pervasive. Overall, Salesforce projects a 94% decrease in packages at risk of being delayed, or 40 million packages worldwide, down from 700 million last year. Just five million packages are expected to be at risk of delay in the U.S. 
These predictions come as consumers place larger and fewer orders. Last-mile carriers have also added year-over-year capacity, and 40% of all U.S. retailers now have a brick-and-mortar presence offering buy online, pickup in store (BOPIS) options. 
Bottlenecks at ports and skyrocketing container costs, two of the key pressures shaping the holidays, should cause consumers to be concerned about product availability. Retailers are responding by consolidating Stock Keeping Units (SKU) — online product catalogs are predicted to shrink by 5% over last year as supply chain challenges continue to play out. And consumers are predicted to come out early again this holiday season to avoid out-of-stocks, with pre-Cyber Week shopping growing 6% in the U.S. (to $29 billion) and 3% globally (to $129 billion).
No more Christmas ‘cookies’: marketing departments disrupted by new change
With global legislation and changing consumer preferences giving way to increased internet privacy, marketing departments are facing one of the greatest disruptions they’ve seen in the last five years. Tracking user activity through third-party data across the web and mobile applications is expected to become more expensive, if not impossible, and first-party data — data that organizations collect and manage on their consumers — will be king. 
Loyalty programs, social media engagement and personalized email marketing are expected to offer opportunities to marketers in the battle for first-party data, with Salesforce projecting 30% growth in ecommerce traffic from social referrals and an 18% rise in email marketing across November and December, compared to last holiday season. 
Brick-and-mortar locations become a critical part of digital strategy
The combination of store associates — fulfilling online orders, offering an endless aisle of products, serving digital shoppers, and becoming social influencers — along with shoppers making purchases on mobile devices while in the store, indicates that physical locations will serve as a critical component of digital strategies this holiday.
As a result, more than six in ten global online orders are predicted to be influenced by brick-and-mortar locations — either by helping to place an online order or by fulfilling it via curbside pickup options. At the same time that labor shortages are wreaking havoc in the lead up to the holidays, it’s becoming more critical than ever for store associates to meet rising consumer expectations.

2021 Salesforce Holiday Insights and Predictions Methodology
To help retailers and brands benchmark holiday performance, Salesforce analyzes aggregated data to produce holiday insights from the activity of over a billion global shoppers across more than 40 countries powered by Commerce Cloud, in addition to Marketing Cloud and Service Cloud data from retailers. Salesforce’s overall holiday data set includes 24 out of the top 30 U.S. online retailers on the 2021 Digital Commerce 360 list and utilizes publicly available third-party data sources.
To qualify for inclusion in the analysis set, a digital commerce site must have transacted throughout the analysis period, in this case April 1, 2019 through August 31, 2021, and meet a monthly minimum visit threshold. Additional data hygiene factors are applied to ensure consistent metric calculation.
The Salesforce holiday predictions are not indicative of the operational performance of Salesforce or its reported financial metrics including GMV growth and comparable customer GMV growth.

84,"September 28, 2021",Salesforce Helps Back San Francisco  Small Businesses with $1M Fund,"

Salesforce today announced a grant program to help support small businesses in San Francisco. The 2021 Salesforce San Francisco Small Business Grants program is designed to provide support for area small businesses impacted by the continued emphasis on virtual work and events resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Applications for the program are open now through October 17, 2021. 
The Salesforce San Francisco Small Business Grants program was developed for San Francisco-based small businesses with between two and 50 employees who have been in business for longer than a year. Funds can be used for rent, salaries, and plans to pivot and grow their businesses.  
“Small businesses represent the best of us. They have spirit, hustle, creativity, and kindness. And they make our communities feel like home,” said Enrique Ortegon, SVP, SMB, Salesforce. “We’re so glad the Salesforce San Francisco Small Business Grants can help support these wonderful businesses in our own backyard.”
Last week, Salesforce brought customers, partners and Trailblazers together for the company’s annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco. Although attendance was lower than typical Dreamforce turnout due to COVID-19 safety precautions, it’s one of the first in-person conferences since the pandemic started — and it’s proving to be a lift for the local San Francisco economy. 
However, local small businesses are still struggling, and that is why Salesforce decided to offer $10,000 grants through this program. 
“Our hope is that the grants distributed will help offset some of the reduced business created by a virtual Dreamforce,” said Ortegon.
The application will close at 11:59 p.m. PT on October 17, 2021, and winners will be announced a few weeks later. To implement the program, Salesforce is partnering with Ureeka, a community that connects small businesses with tools, mentors, and resources to help them grow and thrive.
This is the second time that Salesforce has sponsored a grant program specifically for San Francisco small businesses. A 2020 program reached a diverse group of businesses, including 50% women-owned, 22% Black or African American-owned, 30% Latinx-owned, and 13% LGBTQ+-owned. Recipients included a broad range of businesses including coffee shops, restaurants and bars, salons, childcare, gyms, retailers, auto repair, and more.

85,"September 22, 2021","Salesforce, AWS Expand Partnership with Slack, Voice Sales, and More","

Announcements include AWS integrations for Slack, new voice capabilities for virtual selling, a new virtual care solution, and elevated commitments to reaching Net Zero and overall sustainability.
At Dreamforce this week, Salesforce introduced a massive suite of new technology to help organizations build their digital HQs. Announcements included Salesforce + Slack integrations and innovations, virtual selling enhancements, new solutions to ensure health and safety, and elevated commitments to reaching Net Zero and overall sustainability. 
As organizations redefine what it means to succeed from anywhere, Salesforce and Amazon Web Services (AWS) – the world’s leading cloud provider and a strategic Salesforce partner – are supercharging the digital HQ by helping companies develop industry-specific applications however they want, from wherever they want globally, at any scale. 
Together, Salesforce and AWS are taking their expanded partnership to the next level with:
Slack as the digital HQ: Offering flexible and connected ways of working for development teams building applications across Salesforce and AWS Health and Safety Solutions: Virtual Care offering for Salesforce Health Cloud to help physicians provide remote care at scale.High-Velocity Sales with New Voice Capabilities: Announcing the availability of Amazon Connect + Salesforce High Velocity Sales to help sales teams succeed from anywhere by making it easier to engage prospects and customers, and use AI to glean insights from key conversations. Investing in a Sustainable Future: Deepening their company commitments to joint sustainability initiatives with Salesforce joining Amazon’s The Climate Pledge this week. We’re also optimizing Hyperforce, our next-generation cloud infrastructure, to reduce our carbon footprint and accelerate climate action.
Questions about the partnership news are answered below.

Q: How does AWS supercharge the digital HQ from Salesforce and AWS? 
In a world where everyone is working from anywhere, digital environments can be even more important than physical offices. This year at Dreamforce, Salesforce announced new Slack integrations to help organizations around the world build their digital HQs – enabling them to work better, and grow faster. With Slack, joint Salesforce and AWS customers can better collaborate with colleagues, customers, and partners – no matter where, when, or how they work.
Salesforce, the #1 CRM provider, together with AWS, the world’s leading cloud provider, are supercharging the digital HQ for joint customers by providing the infrastructure they need to succeed from anywhere. By integrating Slack across products and industry solutions, the partnership helps joint Salesforce and AWS customers connect, collaborate and succeed – anywhere, anytime. In doing so, the partnership is changing the way businesses build and deploy technology, responsibly, at global scale.
Customer success through technology is at the center of Salesforce’s partnership with AWS, and Slack provides new transformational benefits to an already expansive collaboration. Slack has also enjoyed a successful strategic partnership with AWS for years. With Slack as the collaboration layer, customers succeed from anywhere with unified AWS and Salesforce products. This helps developers move faster and be more productive.  
The partnership also gives customers new intelligent applications for sales, service, and industry – embedding transformational AWS services like voice, video, AI, and machine learning directly into Salesforce products. And, through our partnership with AWS, our global customers will be able to grow in new markets, fast and at scale, through Hyperforce – our next-generation infrastructure architecture.

“Salesforce and AWS are helping us transform the way we use technology to create better customer experiences. With this partnership, we’ll be able to innovate and deliver faster. 
For example, a customer can book an in-store appointment using My T-Mobile. In the future, we could use AWS machine learning services to recognize their previous online or in-person engagements with our company. Data connectors between Salesforce and AWS would enable us to apply these insights into Salesforce products, enabling T-Mobile sales reps to anticipate customers’ needs and suggest the most relevant products or services for them. These insights could also lead to more delightful and relevant conversations with each customer. 
We’re excited to see how together, Salesforce and AWS can provide technology that empowers us to improve the customer experience.“
– Warren McNeel, SVP of IT, T-Mobile
Q: What’s an example of how customers will benefit from using Slack, Salesforce and AWS together? 
Together, Slack, Salesforce, and AWS make it easier for large, distributed teams to manage the process of building and operating apps across the Salesforce and AWS platforms, allowing teams to innovate more efficiently. Announced in June 2020, the AWS Chatbot for Slack lets teams monitor and use AWS resources directly in Slack channels. Coupled with the new AWS and Salesforce integrations, DevOps teams can now monitor, manage, and deploy apps and integrations that span AWS and Salesforce from one unified engagement layer: their Slack Digital HQ. 
For example, let’s say an organization has built a business-critical app that relies on the unified experiences between Salesforce Platform Events and Amazon EventBridge, as well as other custom services on AWS. If an operation incident occurs, AWS Chatbot can post real-time notifications in-channel and Slack Workflows can automate the creation of a trouble ticket in Salesforce, enabling teams to respond near-instantaneously. Team members can swarm the ticket and pull diagnostic info or run AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) commands directly in-channel. This significantly reduces context switching and speeds up the resolution process.
Q: Why is AWS important to Salesforce’s plans to deliver a virtual care application for Salesforce Health Cloud?
At an enterprise level, technology is essential to help deliver health and safety from anywhere, and Salesforce is determined to empower organizations to deliver better health and safety outcomes for their employees, customers and communities. At a consumer level, there has never been a more important need to rethink how clinicians help patients from anywhere. Patient expectations have changed and virtual care is now fundamental to the patient experience.
At a time where medical resources are scarce, a virtual care (telehealth) solution from Salesforce – powered by AWS services like Amazon Chime SDK and Amazon Transcribe Medical – will focus on connecting patients and clinicians with minimal friction, while at the same time connecting the different steps in the patient’s journey to improve the overall patient experience and satisfaction. 
Both Salesforce and AWS have deep industry knowledge, but with Slack, healthcare teams can also more easily come together with real-time collaboration through Slack-first healthcare and life sciences solutions. This will enable employee engagement from onboarding and beyond, so they can deliver better customer experiences from anywhere.

Q: The first “Intelligent Application” that Salesforce and AWS built together was Service Cloud Voice with Amazon Connect – what has made this so successful for customers? 
Customers of all sizes and industries have seen tremendous success with Salesforce Service Cloud Voice with Amazon Connect because it’s a turnkey solution to get an AI powered contact center up and running fast. There is no need to manage a custom integration or CTI adapter between the Service Cloud agent desktop and a telephony provider — it just works right out of the box. 
As a single, simple solution, Service Cloud Voice brings together phone, digital channels, and CRM data into one unified contact center experience. Amazon Connect then works in tandem to include pre-integrated cloud telephony and automatic speech recognition for both agents and supervisors in Service Cloud, the leading customer service platform. This provides supervisors and agents with access to real-time transcription via Amazon Transcribe, call recording playback via Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and CRM integration with call analytics.
Learn more about Service Cloud Voice + Amazon Connect.
Q: How might the value of Service Cloud Voice + Amazon Connect extend to other use cases, like inside sales?
While there has never been more pressure on brands to deliver amazing customer support from their virtual contact center, voice experiences are also critical for sales teams that need to drive revenue growth in today’s success-from-anywhere world. 
Using the technical foundation of Service Cloud Voice, Salesforce and AWS have now expanded the native support for Amazon Connect into Salesforce High Velocity Sales as well. This means that inside sales teams can use Amazon Connect as their native telephony solution to manage core sales workflows such as outbound click-to-call from a predefined leads list, inbound call management, and automated call transcription for simplified on-call note taking.

Q: Tell us about Salesforce joining Amazon’s The Climate Pledge and commitment to build a more sustainable future together? 
Salesforce believes business is the greatest platform for change, and works to serve the interests of all stakeholders — employees, customers, partners, communities, and the environment. Salesforce’s sustainability vision is to accelerate the world’s largest businesses to Net Zero; sequester 100 GT of carbon through conserving, restoring, and growing 1 trillion trees; focus on oceans health, and energize the ecopreneur revolution.
Salesforce this week announced that it signed The Climate Pledge, an initiative co-founded by Amazon and Global Optimism as a commitment to reach the Paris Agreement 10 years early and be net-zero carbon by 2040. At this time, 200 global organizations have joined The Climate Pledge and committed to pursuing ambitious carbon-reduction activities, including operational changes in the race to fight climate change. Together, Pledge signatories generate over $1.8 trillion in global annual revenues and are expected to collectively mitigate 1.98 billion metric tons of carbon emissions annually by 2040 from a 2020 baseline.

86,"September 21, 2021","Salesforce Launches Health Cloud 2.0, a Connected Platform to Help Deliver Health and Safety from Anywhere","

With Health Cloud 2.0, any business or government can bring people together more safely and deliver care from anywhere, helping support the health of employees, customers, and communities.
SAN FRANCISCO — September 21, 2021 — Salesforce [NYSE: CRM], the global leader in CRM, today announced Health Cloud 2.0, technology designed to empower businesses and governments to deliver better health and safety for their employees, customers, and communities. 
As we navigate a future that’s a hybrid of digital, in-person, and on-site, focus has shifted to ensuring health, safety, and effective business operations in the new normal — which is key to building trust and business continuity. Now, COVID-19 testing, vaccination, contact tracing, wellness assessments, and delivering healthcare from multiple settings are critical as organizations in every industry are looking for ways to be together safely with their customers and employees. 
Salesforce understands these needs intuitively. This week the company is deploying Dreampass, a new part of the Health Cloud 2.0 portfolio, at its three-day, hybrid digital and in-person Dreamforce conference. Dreampass enables robust and scalable COVID-19 safety protocols for in-person attendees, including managing proof of vaccination, integrating with testing vendors, and delivering automated personalized communications throughout the process to help ensure a safer environment for attendees, staff, and the community.  
“We’ve built the Dreampass, powered by Health Cloud 2.0, to bring our community of customers together safely in San Francisco for a special in-person experience unlike anything else in the world.”Sarah Franklin, President and Chief Marketing Officer, Salesforce
“Every company is eager to be together safely with their customers, prospects, employees, and partners as they look to get back to growth and combat digital fatigue,” said Sarah Franklin, President and Chief Marketing Officer, Salesforce. “We built Dreampass, powered by Health Cloud 2.0, to bring our community together safely in San Francisco for a special in-person experience unlike anything else in the world.”
Empowering connected experiences for health and work
The Health Cloud 2.0 portfolio of products will be available to any business in any sector: 
Dreampass is designed to help deliver safer in-person events for employees, customers, and communities. Capabilities including attendee registration management, COVID-19 vaccine and/or testing status verification, and testing vendor integration to help issue testing kits. Dreampass then allows admission upon integrated test results with a personalized QR code. In the case of protocol changes or possible exposure, notifications and messaging also can be sent to the attendee directly.

Contact tracing allows organizations to manually contact trace more safely and securely by collecting only limited, necessary data from individuals who are infected or potentially exposed and creating visual maps of contacts to monitor for potential outbreaks.Vaccine management helps governments and organizations manage vaccine programs at scale quickly, including inventory management, appointment scheduling, outcome monitoring, public health notifications, and more.Value-based care from anywhere enables healthcare organizations to personalize patient experiences and deliver hybrid healthcare experiences in multiple care settings.

88,"September 21, 2021",New Salesforce and Slack Innovations Empower Companies to Create Their Digital HQ,"

Domino’s, Intuit, and Splunk are running their digital HQ with Salesforce and Slack
Innovations enable collaboration with colleagues, customers, and partners – no matter where, when, or how they work
SAN FRANCISCO — September 21, 2021 — Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), the global leader in CRM, today announced new capabilities that integrate Slack across Salesforce’s products and industry solutions, plus new Slack innovations that improve collaboration across organizational boundaries and empower teams to embrace asynchronous working. 
“Our mindset about work has shifted from a place you go, to something you do,” said Bret Taylor, President and Chief Operating Officer of Salesforce. “Every company needs a digital HQ to connect its employees, customers, and partners, and thrive in a work-from-anywhere world. Organizations around the world build their digital HQs on Salesforce and Slack so they can work better and grow faster.”

Following the August launch of new Slack integrations across Sales, Service, Marketing, and Analytics (Tableau), today Salesforce is launching integrations across the majority of its products, including Commerce, Experience, Platform, Trailhead, MuleSoft, and Quip, and its industry clouds and products including Sustainability, Corporate and Investment Banking, Healthcare and Life Sciences, Philanthropy, Nonprofit, and Education.
Also launching is a bevy of new Slack functionality aimed at giving customers the tools they need to thrive in this new era of digital-first work. Clips are a new way to easily create and share audio, video, and screen recordings within any channel or DM in Slack, letting people work more flexibly, on their own time. GovSlack is a version of Slack that meets the most stringent security and compliance needs of the U.S. government and the agencies they work with. And a host of enhancements to Slack Connect make it easier than ever to create and manage connections, even for customers and partners who don’t already use Slack.
“Building your digital HQ means thinking carefully about the digital infrastructure that connects everyone in your business, helping them find new ways to innovate, collaborate and stay connected,” said Stewart Butterfield, CEO and Co-Founder of Slack. “This is a once in a generation opportunity for every company to reinvent themselves and make work more flexible, inclusive and productive. There could not be a more exciting time for Salesforce and Slack to come together to help every company find success in this new digital-first world.”

When organizations made the sudden move to remote work in 2020, most simply translated office-based routines into the virtual world. Today, it’s clear the workplace won’t snap back to the way it was. With nine in 10 companies planning a hybrid model moving forward, organizations must reinvent the processes and tools they previously relied on – such as in-person meetings, company-wide emails, and strategy offsites – for the digital-first world. 
Today’s innovations empower everyone to securely collaborate in channels that unite internal and external teams and streamline workflows built around CRM data, giving them a single source of truth for their business and a trusted, shared view of the customer. 
Customers are building their digital HQs with Salesforce and Slack
Domino’s: “Domino’s has a long history of innovating with delivery, and it’s important for us to lead when it comes to the consumer experience,” said Kelly Garcia, Chief Technology Officer at Domino’s. “The joint power of Salesforce and Slack has helped Domino’s stay efficient, while delivering a unique ordering option for customers.”Intuit: “Managing finances should be simple, and the expertise, tools, and resources that we work with at Intuit are critical to helping our customers achieve their vision of prosperity,” said Gabrielle Dracopoulos, Head of Customer Success & Experience at Intuit. “Intuit has always adopted new technology in search of better ways to serve our customers. Together, Salesforce and Slack are helping us deliver customer benefits at speed, building trust, and making our customer experience more meaningful.” Splunk: “We are on our way to transforming the way Splunk responds to customer support cases that are reported as customer incidents,” said Crystal Christensen, VP Global Support at Splunk. Salesforce is helping us automate how we respond to these customer support incidents, as we aim to reduce our time to resolution while continuing to mitigate impact to our customers as quickly as possible.”

89,"September 21, 2021",Salesforce Achieves Net Zero Across Its Value Chain and 100% Renewable Energy,"

Editor’s Note: This article references Salesforce Sustainability Cloud, which is now known as Net Zero Cloud. For the latest on Salesforce’s sustainability solutions, check out this product page. For the latest news on Salesforce’s sustainability efforts, check out this page.
Salesforce achieves Net Zero across its value chain and 100% renewable energy 
Sustainability Cloud 2.0 launches to help customers reach Net Zero, faster
In partnership with Global Citizen and 1T.org, Salesforce funds an additional 30M trees this year to reach its goal of 100M trees by 2030; donates $1M to American Forests and One Tree Planted
San Francisco — September 21, 2021 — Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), the global leader in CRM, today announced that it is a Net Zero company across its full value chain and has achieved 100% renewable energy for its operations. Salesforce developed emissions reductions strategies across Scope 1, 2 and 3 in four key categories—work from anywhere, infrastructure, business travel, and supply chain. 
Salesforce is also unveiling Sustainability Cloud 2.0 to accelerate customers’ path to Net Zero, empowering organizations to track and reduce their carbon emissions and become a sustainable business. New innovations include Slack-First Sustainability for better collaboration with suppliers, a carbon-offset ecosystem, and industry specific climate action plans.  
“Climate change is one of the most pressing crises we face as a planet, and each one of us has a responsibility to help,” said Marc Benioff, CEO and Chair, Salesforce. “I’m proud that Salesforce is one of the few companies to have achieved Net Zero and 100% renewable energy, but we can’t stop until we embrace every solution and get every business on board. Together, we can sequester 100 gigatons of carbon by restoring, conserving or growing 1 trillion trees; energize an ecopreneur revolution to develop innovative climate solutions; and accelerate the Fortune 1000 to reach Net Zero.”
“I’m proud that Salesforce is one of the few companies to have achieved Net Zero and 100% renewable energy, but we can’t stop until we embrace every solution and get every business on board.” marc benioff, chair and ceo, salesforce
“Climate change impacts everyone and everything, and it disproportionately impacts the poorest and most vulnerable, amplifying global inequality,” said Suzanne DiBianca, Chief Impact Officer and EVP of Corporate Relations at Salesforce. “Sustainability Cloud supercharged our path to Net Zero, and we’re empowering customers with the transformational tools and trusted data they need to reduce their carbon emissions and take climate action.” 
Sustainability is essential to becoming a trusted enterprise. Customers want to do business with companies that are fully committed to climate action. In fact, 58% of people are willing to spend more with businesses that fight climate change. 
Salesforce expands Net Zero to its entire value chain (Scope 1, 2, and 3)
Salesforce is continuing to drive towards a 1.5°C future by focusing on six sustainability priorities: emissions reduction, carbon removal, trillion trees & ecosystem restoration, education & mobilization, innovation, and regulation & policy.
Today, the company is releasing its Climate Action Plan to offer a blueprint for others to accelerate their journey to Net Zero. 
“We need bold and urgent action if we are to deliver the promise of Paris and a healthier, cleaner, more resilient zero carbon world in time. Salesforce has shown significant leadership in climate action through their innovation, supply chain decarbonisation and policy advocacy work, and I encourage businesses around the world to step up now and join us in the Race to Zero emissions,” said Nigel Topping, UN High Level Climate Champions for COP26.

Salesforce’s six sustainability priorities and a blueprint for other organizations to accelerate their journey to Net Zero.

Salesforce achieved Net Zero emissions by: 
Committing publicly to the shared, global goal of achieving a just and equitable transition to Net Zero, in line with a 1.5°C future.Prioritizing reducing emissions as quickly as possible and aligning its own full value chain emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3) to the global trajectory of ~50% emissions reductions by 2030, and near-zero emissions by 2040. With Sustainability Cloud, Salesforce identified the most impactful opportunities to lower its carbon footprint.Compensating for any remaining emissions by purchasing renewable energy and carbon credits of high credibility, impact, and co-benefits. In the long-term using removal credits only and in the near term using a combination of avoidance and removal credits.
In 2021, Salesforce achieved 100% renewable energy, purchasing enough renewable energy to match all electricity it uses globally. Since first committing to this goal in 2013, Salesforce has been working to accelerate the global transition to clean and renewable sources of electricity with the aim for a future where renewable energy is powering the world around the clock.
To address climate change, businesses need to decrease emissions and increase carbon removals from the atmosphere. Salesforce is focused on deploying natural carbon removal tools, including trees and oceans, while scaling technology-based carbon removal solutions. From ecopreneurs to enterprises — innovation is needed to expedite the path to decarbonization. 

Sustainability Cloud 2.0 gets companies to Net Zero, faster
More than 70% of people believe emissions reduction should factor into business operations, yet tracking a company’s full value chain emissions is complex and time consuming. With Sustainability Cloud, Salesforce was able to reduce its carbon accounting process from more than six months to just six weeks. 
Sustainability Cloud is designed to help customers track and reduce their emissions and take action through a full view of their environmental footprint with investor-grade data for customizable ESG reporting. This data is essential for third-party audits, financial filings, corporate reputation, and building trust with all stakeholders.  Customers including Clif Bar & Company, ISDI, MillerKnoll, Uhuru, and XERO are already beginning to use Sustainability Cloud to track their carbon emissions and take action.

Today, Salesforce is introducing Sustainability Cloud 2.0 to help businesses accelerate to Net Zero by making progress on the six sustainability priorities and turning commitments into action. In the next generation of Sustainability Cloud, companies will see the following: 
Suppliers are a significant part of the carbon reduction equation. Companies will get investor-grade scope 3 reporting with Slack-First Sustainability, allowing them to effortlessly connect and securely collaborate at scale with suppliers around science-based emission reduction targets through Slack Connect.Every industry has unique needs. Businesses will be able to visualize their fastest path to Net Zero with Climate Action Planning, which includes forecasting, scenario planning and built-in decarbonization plans.Climate action needs everyone to mobilize and collaborate. Salesforce is investing in building an Open Exchange Ecosystem, in which customers will be able to purchase and manage high-quality carbon credits from ecopreneurs, advocate for science-based climate policies, and democratize sustainability by educating teams.
“At Clif Bar, we are guided by our values, like striving to create a healthy and sustainable food system. We know that fostering collective climate action, in partnership with our suppliers, is key to our success,” said Roma McCaig, Senior Vice President of  Impact and Communications, Clif Bar & Company. “We’ve committed to creating a net positive impact on climate. That’s why we’re leveraging Salesforce’s Sustainability Cloud to further enhance visibility into our carbon footprint while also helping our suppliers reduce their own.”
Nature-based solutions are critical to addressing the climate crisis
At Salesforce, the environment is a key stakeholder, and trees are one of the most effective solutions to pull carbon out of the atmosphere. That’s why Salesforce is a founding partner of 1t.org, a movement to conserve, restore and grow 1 trillion trees by 2030.
Through Dreamforce Gives, Salesforce is donating $1M to American Forests and One Tree Planted to advance tree equity and urban canopy in lower income communities and neighborhoods and to reforest disaster-affected areas. 
Dreamforce Gives: American Forests will focus its efforts in Dallas, Phoenix and Rhode Island — areas that are grappling with extreme heat and have been identified by American Forests’ Tree Equity Score as having high disparities in tree canopy — and plant more than 1,700 trees in underserved communities across these areas. One Tree Planted will plant trees globally to support urban reforestation and tree equity in lower income communities and neighborhoods.Global Citizen: As part of the company’s commitment to the planet, Salesforce is partnering with leaders and activists for Global Citizen, a movement to mobilize millions of people around the world to defend the planet and defeat poverty. Inspired by the actions of global citizens and as part of the Global Citizen Live event, taking place on September 25th, and in partnership with 1T.org, Salesforce will fund the restoration, conservation, and growth of an additional 30 million trees by this year driving forward its overall goal of 100M trees by the end of the decade.Trees for Jane: Salesforce is also a proud supporter of Trees for Jane, a new campaign to protect and restore the world’s trees and forests, inspired by Dr. Jane Goodall. Trees for Jane aims to stop deforestation while also empowering individuals to plant and care for their own tree or trees in their backyards, rooftops, or with local community groups.
The protection of our planet requires everyone — governments, investors, businesses, individuals — working together, today, to take climate action.

90,"September 20, 2021",Multinational Utility ENGIE Unifies Data across Salesforce Customer 360 for ‘Greener’ Future,"

French multinational utility company ENGIE leveraged Salesforce Customer 360 for sales of its tailored, low carbon solutions during the pandemic, helping grow customer relationships and increase sales opportunities.
Driving the news: As catastrophic as it has been, COVID-19 has also shown us what’s possible when the need is urgent. Governments ramped up medical services and financial support. Companies adapted their supply chains and business models. Individuals changed the way they worked and consumed goods.
As a result, carbon emissions dropped to a level not seen since the global financial crisis of 2007–2008.
The question is: Will it last? As a global energy player, ENGIE is doing everything it can to ensure that the sudden correction to lower carbon emissions will provide the impetus the world needs for a greener future.
What’s the impact: ENGIE’s adoption of Salesforce Customer 360 helped its teams be more productive and collaborative: 
Decreased the time required to train agents by 50%.Reduced the amount of coding needed in France and Belgium by half with Salesforce solution’s library of prebuilt processes.Accelerate time to value with 2.3X faster implementation.Increased sales opportunities by 1.7X — even during COVID-19.
In-depth: ENGIE is using Salesforce Customer 360 to unite data across sales, service, and IT teams and provide a single, shared view of every customer from anywhere in the world:
Tableau CRM provides ENGIE a shared workspace across the company’s sales, service, and marketing teams globally, giving team members actionable insights into how customers engage with ENGIE products and services.Salesforce Service Cloud, Field Service Lightning, and MuleSoft work together to help ENGIE intelligently prioritize essential jobs by automatically assigning the right workers to accessible projects based on skills, location, and business rules. Additionally, 4,000 field technicians can access ENGIE customer data and knowledge articles to resolve jobs faster, identify assets and parts instantly, and complete paperwork in the field – even when they’re offline. Salesforce Industries (Energy & Utilities Cloud) automates many of ENGIE’s processes and delivers digital-first, personalized utility sales and service experience for both B2B and B2C customers as well as their employees, helping to yield a significant reduction in training time for new service agents.Quip helps improve coordination between account teams, promotes information sharing, and increases productivity, allowing sales team members access to valuable insights to close new deals, build stronger relationships with customers, and grow existing accounts. With Marketing Cloud and CPQ for Communities, the company’s marketing team can create a seamless experience across multiple touchpoints and enable resellers with real-time product and pricing information.MyTrailhead provides a tailored six-week learning program for ENGIE team members designed to help sales representatives remain engaged with the company while remote, grow their digital skills, and become better prepared to get back to work after the lockdown is lifted.
What they’re saying: “25 million customers have evolved in their expectations. Salesforce is helping us globally to address these demands faster and in real time,” said Yves Le Gélard, Executive Vice President, Digital & Information Systems, ENGIE. “And we’re committed to stepping up to create a carbon-neutral world. It’s for the greater good of our customers, but also for mankind.”

92,"September 20, 2021",Salesforce Gives $19M to Schools,"

Grants support five school districts across the United States and education nonprofits
New funds mark more than $100 million given to Bay Area school districts to date
San Francisco – September 20, 2021 – Salesforce [NYSE: CRM], the global leader in CRM, today announced $17.25 million in new grants to support five school districts across the United States – San Francisco Unified School District, Oakland Unified School District, Chicago Public Schools, Indianapolis Public Schools, and the New York City Department of Education. In addition, $1.75 million was granted to education nonprofits in the United States and Europe.
The grants support critical programs for education access and advancement, with a focus on racial equity. This series of grants brings Salesforce’s total investment in education to more than $140 million.
As the COVID-19 Delta variant surges, school administrators must adapt to changing conditions in real time and make decisions in an uncertain environment. McKinsey estimates that last year, students lost the equivalent of three months of learning in mathematics and one-and-a-half months of learning in reading. This gap was especially noticeable in schools that predominantly serve students of color. 
Now more than ever, schools need support. With these grants, Salesforce is building upon its longstanding commitment to education to help schools address growing inequities and get students back on track. 
“Back to school looks different this year, and there are new demands on teachers, parents, and students,” said Ebony Beckwith, Chief Philanthropy Officer, Salesforce. “To ensure their success, we’re leaning into our values and bringing the full power of our platform to help support them through another year of pandemic learning.”
Back to school looks different this year, and there are new demands on teachers, parents, and students. To ensure their success, we’re leaning into our values and bringing the full power of our platform to help support them through another year of pandemic learning.”Ebony Beckwith, Chief Philanthropy Officer, Salesforce
“The past year and a half was a challenge for not only staff but also students. To have a community partner like Salesforce come alongside our school district with such a generous donation is invaluable,” said IPS Superintendent Dr. Alessia Johnson. “These additional resources will help IPS address the specific needs of our students — during and after the pandemic — through learning acceleration, ensuring we can continue to provide 1:1 technology and access to reliable internet service for students, and that we’re also focusing on the whole child through social emotional learning and trauma-informed care. I often say that we’re stronger together and it’s partnerships with organizations like Salesforce that highlights how working together can yield awesome benefits for our children.”
“Salesforce is an invaluable partner to the students and educators of Oakland Unified,” said OUSD Superintendent Dr. Kyla Johnson-Trammell. “The remarkable support they give our middle schools, our teachers, our newcomers, and of course, our computer science students is game-changing. We are able to provide computer science instruction, newcomer support, support for middle schools, and connect students and families to much-needed services through the Education Cloud platform, all of which could not happen this way just a few short years ago. As the African proverb says, it takes a village to raise a child. OUSD is grateful that Salesforce is part of our village.”
$100 million to Bay Area schools since 2012
This year marks a milestone of Salesforce’s nearly decade-long commitment to Bay Area schools. With the new funds announced today, Salesforce will now have given $100 million to San Francisco and Oakland Unified School Districts to date. Today’s announcement includes:
San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD)
As part of a nine-year partnership, the $7.5M grant will support efforts to address the digital divide, accelerate learning, and continue excellence in STEM and middle school redesign. This grant will provide computer science curriculum, support math and science teachers, recruit teachers for hard-to-staff positions, redesign middle schools, and offer additional equity-driven learning opportunities via Aim High & Black Star Rising. The grant also supports the Principal Innovation Fund, delivering $100,000 per school of unrestricted funds to all SFUSD middle-school principals.
Oakland Unified School District (OUSD)
This is Salesforce’s sixth year of supporting the district.The $7.5M grant will help the district create new social-emotional support programs for students, offer professional growth for teachers, provide computer science and math tutoring, and counsel students who are newcomers to the U.S.OUSD will also receive $100,000 Principal Innovation Fund school allocations for each of its middle schools. Additionally, OUSD uses Salesforce.org’s Education Cloud for K-12 to connect staff members in real-time to match students with critical services—from counseling to mental health, nutritional support, and more. 
Supporting education across the U.S.
Salesforce is also continuing its support of school districts in cities with a strong employee base. The longstanding relationships with SFUSD and OUSD have provided a blueprint that guides newer relationships with Chicago, Indianapolis, and New York City schools to support current needs due to the pandemic, and ongoing investments around STEM. These grants include:
Chicago Public Schools (CPS)
The $750K grant will support CPS in launching a new Healing Centered Framework to address students’ social emotional needs after COVID-19, build the school leadership pipeline, and provide STEM college and career experiences in underserved communities.This is Salesforce’s fourth investment in the district and is managed through the Children First Fund, the Chicago Public Schools Foundation
Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS)
The $750K grant creates crucial new programs to address learning loss, digital divide, and social-emotional wellness after COVID-19.This is Salesforce’s fourth year supporting the district.
New York City Department of Education (NYC DOE)
The $750K grant will help NYCDOE prepare its educators to accelerate student learning, particularly in the communities hit hardest by COVID-19.This is Salesforce’s third year supporting the district.
Salesforce doubles down on education commitment globally
In addition to its school district partners, Salesforce is supporting nonprofits across the United States, France, and the United Kingdom that focus on academic achievement, education leadership, and improving access to underprivileged students. Grants include:
School Board Partners (U.S.): A $250K grant will support the organization to connect, inspire, and support equity-informed elected school board members nationally.OneGoal (U.S.): A $500K grant will support the continued digital transformation of OneGoal and empower 10,000 students toward achieving their highest post-secondary aspirations.Forum des Images (France): A $500K grant will help improve the academic success of 600 students and to increase teachers’ confidence to adopt digital learning methods in underserved schools.The Access Project (UK): A $500K grant will provide mentoring, tutoring, and enrichment support to 320 underprivileged students in London to improve college access.
Employees adopt 130+ schools globally
To date, Salesforce employees have volunteered nearly one million hours to support education and workforce development initiatives.
Through Salesforce’s global Circle the Schools program, employees participate in volunteer activities designed to advance student skills, including literacy in elementary schools, STEM in middle schools, and college and career readiness in high schools. Since 2013, Salesforce employees have adopted more than 130 schools globally in cities, including 34 schools in San Francisco and Oakland.
This year, Salesforce is also encouraging employees and community members to support a new series of education fundraising campaigns.

93,"September 20, 2021",New Study Finds Salesforce Economy Will Create 9.3 Million Jobs and $1.6 Trillion in New Business Revenues by 2026,"

Salesforce partner ecosystem on track to grow to nearly six times the size of Salesforce itself by 2026
SAN FRANCISCO — September 20, 2021 — Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), the global leader in CRM, today announced a new study from IDC that finds Salesforce and its ecosystem of partners will create 9.3 million new jobs and $1.6 trillion in new business revenues worldwide by 2026. The study also finds that Salesforce is driving immense growth for its partner ecosystem, which will make $6.19 for every $1 Salesforce makes by 2026.

Building digital HQs helps solve for urgent transformation needs
IDC forecasts1 that cloud-related technologies will account for 27% of digital transformation IT spending this year, growing to 37% in 2026, as businesses focus on establishing digital HQs to deliver customer and employee success from anywhere. Remote work, contactless customer engagement, and sustainability efforts are becoming more prevalent than ever, and IDC expects this trend will only continue. 
“IDC forecasts that cloud-related technologies will account for 27% of digital transformation IT spending this year, growing to 37% in 2026”
As more companies build out digital HQs to support an increasingly remote workforce, Salesforce technologies have helped its customers adjust to uncertainty – enabling remote work and remote contact with customers, and making it possible to develop new products in weeks, not months2 . 
IDC also conducted a survey of 525 enterprises across eight countries on cloud deployment and the benefits and challenges of cloud computing. Of the 74% of survey respondents who say their organizations have a formal digital transformation strategy, 97% rate cloud computing as important to that strategy. The survey also found that Salesforce solutions have enabled:
47% of customer respondents to expand their workforce to more suburban and rural areas.38% of customer respondents to expand their workforce to new populations (for example, stay-at-home parents and people with disabilities).36% of customer respondents to support a more flexible work environment.
Salesforce technologies can also help companies plan for a more sustainable future. IDC forecasts that from 2021 to 2024, migration from on-premise software to the cloud could reduce as much as 1 billion metric tons of CO23. Salesforce itself has set a goal of pursuing 100% renewable energy for its global operations by 2022, and currently delivers a carbon-neutral cloud to all its customers. And, according to IDC’s customer survey, 39% of Salesforce customers surveyed look to Salesforce as a source of support in reaching their own sustainability objectives.



The Salesforce partner ecosystem drives worldwide acceleration of growth
IDC predicts that the use of Salesforce and its ecosystem’s cloud services will generate $308 billion in the customer base this year and more than double that in 2026, at $724 billion. Today, the ecosystem of Salesforce partners delivering cloud services to customers is five times as big as Salesforce itself, and will be more than six times as big in 2026. The study also found that 2026 ecosystem revenues are forecast to be 3.5 times those in 2020.

“The Salesforce partner ecosystem extends the power of Salesforce to companies of all sizes, across industries and helps make customer success possible,” said Tyler Prince, EVP, Alliances & Channels, Salesforce. “As Salesforce grows, so do our partners — and we are committed to providing our expanding partner ecosystem with the tools needed to succeed in the jobs of the future.”
Salesforce paves pathways to help unlock career opportunities in the Salesforce Economy
23% of new jobs created in the Salesforce customer base this year leverage significant digital skills — such as using automation tools, the Internet of Things ( IoT), and other complex applications. Trailhead, Salesforce’s free online learning platform, and its Trailblazer Community, which accelerates this learning through peer-to-peer knowledge sharing and support, empower anyone to learn digital skills for the growing Salesforce economy. 
“For Salesforce, it’s not only about creating new technology and career opportunities; we have to pave pathways to these new jobs,”Kris Lande, SVP Trailblazer Ecosystem, Salesforce
Salesforce is also helping companies navigate their digital transformations through these platforms; 84% of survey respondents at companies using Trailhead say it’s important to their organization’s deployment of cloud solutions, and 44% said it’s “critically” so.
“For Salesforce, it’s not only about creating new technology and career opportunities; we have to pave pathways to these new jobs,” said Kris Lande, SVP, Trailblazer Ecosystem, Salesforce. “We’ve made it our mission to empower people with the tools they need to build dynamic careers, companies, and communities with Salesforce, and thrive in a digital-first world.”

How Salesforce is creating jobs to fuel the Salesforce Economy
Salesforce has a number of programs and initiatives to help create the jobs of the future — and to fill them with well-equipped candidates:
The Trailblazer Community is a network of 15 million people across the Salesforce ecosystem who help each other learn new skills and succeed with Salesforce. The Trailblazer Community offers an online platform to connect from anywhere, as well as more than 1,300 active regional and interest-based groups around the world. Members share their guidance and expertise and support each other as they build careers and companies with Salesforce. To date, 3 in 5 Trailblazers credit their participation in the Trailblazer Community with helping them get a new job or promotion.Trailhead has empowered nearly 3.5 million people to learn in-demand skills for the future of work. With Trailhead, learners can skill up for free from anywhere and earn globally-recognized credentials for careers in the Salesforce ecosystem. Trailhead provides guided career paths for Salesforce roles, and is introducing three new roles to create entry points into some of the fastest-growing fields today: Marketer, Sales, and Designer. The Salesforce Talent Alliance is an initiative that connects partners to job candidates trained on Salesforce via Trailhead and brings new talent into the fast-growing ecosystem. This year, two Talent Alliance partners are Salesforce’s Partner Innovation Awards recipients for demonstrating excellence in expanding the Salesforce economy by training and hiring new and diverse pipelines of talent:Cognizant, in collaboration with Salesforce, the University of Montana and ATG, a Cognizant Company built a 12-week paid Salesforce training program called Aim Higher, which has developed more than 175 new Salesforce credentialed consultants in the past two years.Bucher + Suter is a Salesforce ISV partner that champions and is a sponsor of Noser Young, which is a leading IT Trainer in Switzerland. Through the Noser Young partnership, Bucher + Suter takes on apprentices every year to help with their education in IT.
What is the Salesforce Economy?
IDC defines “The Salesforce Economy” as the footprint of Salesforce and its partner ecosystem on the economy at large. This includes the revenues and jobs directly generated in the Salesforce customer base from the use of Salesforce and its partners cloud services, as well as jobs created indirectly in the economy by local spending by direct employees and Salesforce and its partners themselves.
Salesforce’s multi-faceted partner ecosystem is a driving force behind the Salesforce Economy’s massive growth:
The Salesforce partner ecosystem can help customers grow faster. Throughout a customer’s journey, partners fill technology whitespace and offer solutions across products, industries, and regions. The Salesforce partner ecosystem includes consulting partners, independent software vendors (ISVs), and resellers that bring the power of apps and expertise to solve customer challenges.Launched in 2006, Salesforce AppExchange is the world’s leading enterprise cloud marketplace, with over 6,700 partner listings and more than 9 million installs. 90% of the Fortune 500 and 91% of Salesforce customers rely on partner apps and expertise found on AppExchange.

IDC Methodology
The Salesforce Economic Impact Model is an extension to IDC’s IT Economic Impact Model. It estimates Salesforce’s current and future share of the benefits to the general economy generated by cloud computing, and it also estimates the size of the ecosystem supporting Salesforce using IDC’s market research on the ratio of spending on professional services to cloud subscriptions; the ratio of sales of hardware, software, and networking to spending on public and private cloud computing; and the ratio of spending on application development tools to applications developed.
Note that the ecosystem may include companies that are not formal business partners of Salesforce but that nevertheless sell products or services associated with the Salesforce implementations.

94,"September 17, 2021",New IDC Report Examines Salesforce’s ‘Gold Standard’ Customer Success Delivery,"

According to a new IDC report, “Salesforce is a technology industry gold standard for customer success. Salesforce was a pioneer of the concept and was one of the first businesses in any industry to publicly advocate a goal of customer success.”
Driving the news: In 2018, Salesforce invested in connecting its Sales and Customer Success teams to deliver a unified, end-to-end customer experience. Then, in 2021, the Customer Success Group (CSG) expanded to include both partner organizations (Alliances and Channels) and Ignite — Salesforce’s in-house customer innovation and consulting organization. 
As a result of this expansion, Salesforce is better able to offer customers of multiple sizes and industries integrated, trusted experts, and high-value services – and drive mutual accountability for customer success.
What’s the impact: The IDC report, “Customer Success — The Salesforce Approach,”1 focuses on Salesforce’s Success 360 methodology, which connects the pre-sale and post-sale experience and delivers value at every step of the customer journey. It includes four steps:

“Salesforce has succeeded in transforming its customer success operations into a strategic competitive advantage,” said Gerry Brown, research director, IDC European CX. “Its commitment to customer success is striking. It has connected customer success and sustainable long-term revenue growth that fuels its customer success investment decisions. Other technology vendors would be well advised to follow its example down this route.”
The Salesforce perspective: Customer success should be considered a business model — more than service alone — that can galvanize morale and motivation and direct customer experience (CX) investments to measurable and tangible customer outcomes. 
Companies should consider implementing a dedicated CSG team to ensure low customer churn, market share growth within enterprise customer accounts, and long-term loyalty, advocacy, and customer value.

95,"September 17, 2021",Salesforce Supports Climate Investments Outlined in U.S. Budget Reconciliation Package,"

Salesforce believes that the United States must take action to avoid the most devastating impacts of the climate crisis. The IPCC’s recently released climate report states that the world is “code red for humanity.” This urgent call for action means that the United States must reduce emissions now to avoid the most devastating impacts of the climate emergency.  
Salesforce today announced its support of the climate investments outlined in the proposed reconciliation package, recognizing the critical returns they will deliver for the economy, the climate, and global communities. 
Salesforce is committed to the global goal of achieving a just and equitable transition to Net Zero, in line with a 1.5°C degree future. The company also supports the goals of the Paris Agreement and the most recent commitment by the United States to reduce emissions by 50-52% by 2030 and achieve Net Zero by 2050. 
The climate-focused elements of the proposed reconciliation package represent significant strides toward delivering on this commitment — decarbonizing the nation’s infrastructure, prioritizing high-quality, good-paying jobs, investing in community resilience, and advancing environmental justice to deliver a sustainable future. 
Salesforce has been committed to a clean energy future since 2013. The company will meet a target of 100% renewable energy this year, with a larger, long-term energy goal of building a future where renewable energy is powering the world around-the-clock. In addition, the company is a vocal supporter of the Clean Electricity Performance Program which, along with renewable energy tax credits and needed investments in transmission infrastructure, would create an efficient, 21st Century electricity grid and is expected to place the United States on track to meet an 80% clean electricity target by 2030. 
Salesforce also supports the proposed Civilian Climate Corps as an opportunity to create hundreds of thousands of climate jobs and enhance efforts — especially in underserved communities — to fight climate change. From installing solar panels and weatherizing buildings, to building trails and restoring natural ecosystems, to helping prevent catastrophic wildfires, the Civilian Climate Corps would put Americans to work building a sustainable and equitable future.
Salesforce recognizes the critical role of enhancing community resilience in the face of climate change. As climate change and sea-level rise accelerate, extreme weather events are becoming more intense and frequent, and communities of color are experiencing the worst impacts of these disasters. A robust investment in coastal restoration and resilience projects would create high-quality, good-paying jobs—coastal restoration work is labor-intensive, with jobs that cannot be mechanized or exported—and sequester carbon, all while protecting coastal communities from the escalating climate crisis. 
Nature plays a critical role in combating climate change, which is why Salesforce is committed to conserving, restoring and growing 100 million trees by 2030 in partnership with 1T.org. And is why the company also continues to advocate for investments in conservation, drought, and forestry programs that would sequester carbon emissions, enhance forestry management, and improve wildfire resilience and recovery.  
We need action, collaboration and investments now to step up to the urgent challenge of climate change. Salesforce is committed to advancing science-based climate policy — from reconciliation to the bipartisan infrastructure package — that puts the United States on track for a 1.5° future. 
It’s easy to focus on the cost of climate action, but the increasing severity and frequency of unprecedented, deadly and costly extreme weather events make it crystal clear that the cost of inaction is far higher.
