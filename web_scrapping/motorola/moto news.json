We also gave it an eye-catching look, with subtle, jewel-like patterns that shift and change as you tilt the phone from side to side for complexity and depth. An in-display fingerprint reader lets you instantly wake up and unlock your phone with a touch of the screen.\nThe edge 30 houses a 50 MP Ultra-wide camera sensor, 32 MP dedicated front-facing camera, and our most advanced 50 MP high-res camera using the new flagship standard for autofocus, Instant All-Pixel Focus, to shoot with 32x more focusing pixels. While traditional focus technologies use around 3% of pixels, Instant All Pixel Focus uses 100% of pixels in both vertical and horizontal patterns to get faster, more accurate performance in any light. This camera captures sharp details in the daytime, and then as night falls, lets in more light by combining every four pixels into one massive ultra pixel. Combined with Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), which eliminates unwanted shakes, you\u2019re set to shoot the best photos in a whole new way. And the brilliance goes beyond photos\u2014you can record HDR10 videos with over a billion shades of color for more lifelike storytelling than ever before.\nThe motorola edge 30 is a content creator\u2019s dream - its camera is more than just a set of sensors. Oftentimes camera quality suffers in 3rd party apps like TikTok, WhatsApp and Instagram, but with the edge 30, we paid special attention to performance in areas like facial rendering, front camera video recording or video chats, and significant noise reduction when capturing still images. All of this means you\u2019ll always look your best on video calls, and the content you capture for social media and more will benefit from your camera\u2019s full potential. \nWatch your favorite movies and games come to life on the 6.5\" OLED display with 144Hz refresh rate and HDR10+ that meets DCI-P3 cinematic standards for color range, brightness, color accuracy, and contrast level, so you can view everything in over a billion shades of color. With Dolby Atmos, feel sound reimagined with more depth, clarity, and detail in your entertainment for a spatial sound experience through the edge 30\u2019s two large stereo speakers.\nPotent performance and power\nYou will experience a huge performance boost in everything from the games you play to the videos you record thanks to the power of the Snapdragon 778G+. Download, stream, and video chat without lag, and connect to the fastest Wi-Fi 6E1 networks with an advanced modem for more than you ever thought possible. The newest edge has up to 8 GB of RAM and up to 256 GB of storage2, ensuring you never slow down on the go.\nWith motorola edge 30 you can also unleash your device with Ready For3, that amplifies everything your phone is capable of.

While it\u2019s exhilarating to hear about emerging technologies and trends ahead from industry experts, what about the everyday people using tech for good in their professions, hobbies and beyond?\nTo help us paint a better picture of what is to come in 2022, innovators at Motorola shared a few notable predictions for the year ahead. From more solutions for hybrid work models to a focus on tech as a force for good, here are Motorola\u2019s 2022 tech predictions.\n#1: Work-from-anywhere as the new Work-from-Home\n2022 will kickstart the evolution from work-from-home to work-from-anywhere. Tech companies all across the globe are allowing employees to work from home longer or even permanently, given the advantages of remote work, and we foresee this trend continuing well into the future.  \nThat\u2019s why, this year, we predict an increase in products, solutions and services designed to improve the remote employee experience. New office designs and audio\/video technology will also pave the way for flexible meeting setups and new ways to build social connections. No longer will consumers have to adjust to adequate technology or products.  Instead, products will cater to emerging consumer needs allowing them to thrive wherever they choose to work.  For example, we predict Artificial intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR) solutions will create immersive workplaces for employees no matter where they are, with innovations such as Ready For1, which enable motorola devices like the moto g100 to tether to ThinkReality A3 Smart Glasses allowing for an extended mobile desktop, video, gaming and entertainment experiences in augmented reality.\n#2: Tech for Good\nTech access and inclusivity will - and should - be a major focus for the mobile industry in 2022 and beyond. We predict more mobile tech innovations being released that better help represent languages, disabilities, gender and racial groups. For example, we at Motorola launched our Indigenous Languages program earlier this year, where our devices now support two languages deemed \u201cendangered.\u201d This is just the first of many milestones we hope to achieve in our indigenous languages project - we can\u2019t wait to unveil more on this in the near future. \nWe think we\u2019ll see more innovations released like this, especially those with languages, disabilities, and gender and racial groups being more represented.\n#3: Monitors are having a moment\nWe predict the monitor will soon have all the features necessary to enhance connectivity and add more value at the office and home in 2022. Monitors will also complement additional devices beyond PCs and extend functionality to smartphones and gaming consoles.\nLike Motorola\u2019s Ready For platform, we predict tech companies will concentrate their efforts on developing software experiences for different types of displays and devices to be used seamlessly together. We\u2019ve seen the expansion of monitors become essential for at home or work, and we think this continuity of content from one device to another will continue to bring new value and ease of use to consumers.  \n#4: The proliferation of form factors\nWhile we predicted 2021 as the year of foldables, the pandemic\u2019s effect on supply chain impacted the timeline, leading us to believe 2022 will be the year of new and improved form factors. With the need to work from anywhere, consumers are considering new types of devices to make this a seamless experience.\nWe predict smartphones will continue to see new forms and improve with OLED technology, flexible hinges, and more, to help make work-from-anywhere a reality. We believe flexible displays will also come to other device concepts and form factors across smartphones, tablets, PCs and laptops.  Flexible displays will also bring rise to new applications on digital signage, public transport and smart home appliances in the year ahead. \nTo read more about Motorola\u2019s & Lenovo\u2019s tech predictions for 2022 and beyond, please visit the Lenovo StoryHub. \n\nLegal Disclaimers\n1 Ready For wired connection supported with TVs or monitors that have HDMI port or USB-C video-in port; video-enabled USB-C cable or USB-C-to-HDMI adaptor required.

Instead, we build on the great things Google does with Android with a comprehensive suite of experiences called My UX, putting you in control of your mobile experience.  My UX encompasses all the great moto experiences, moto specific apps and unique customizations to take music, videos, games, and your phone's style to the next level. Whether it\u2019s turning on the flashlight with a simple chop gesture, launching the camera with the twist of a wrist, bringing creativity to life with moto note or changing your icon shapes, color schemes and display font to fit your style \u2013 it\u2019s all a part of My UX. \nAnd since My UX doesn\u2019t get in the way of a pure Android experience, users get to make the most of new customizations and updates coming on Android 12. \nWhat to expect with your Android 12 Update  \nMaterial You on Motorola Smartphones\nReflect your personal style across your whole device.\nAndroidTM 12 rethinks the entire user interface, from shapes, light and motion, to customizable system colors that can be adapted to match you. Material You is Google\u2019s material design language that elevates what we\u2019ve already begun with My UX. It prioritizes simplicity while adding personal touches that let you control Android 12\u2019s visual elements according to your preferences. Redesigned to be more spacious and comfortable, it\u2019s the most expressive, dynamic and personal OS ever. \n\nNow, you can change the wallpaper on your device and your entire Android 12 experience changes to match. Using advanced color extraction algorithms, you can easily personalize the look and feel of your entire phone, including notifications, settings, widgets and even select apps. We\u2019re combining the dynamic color, rounded shapes, and large open layouts from Material You with the rich, premium feel of the Motorola brand.  \n\nBest of all, these settings are now centralized in one convenient place. Just access Personalize from the home screen menu, then make individual changes to font style and size, colors, icon shapes and layouts, device sounds, display size, and your wallpapers. \n\nConversation Widgets\nControl your connected devices from one place.\nAn all-new conversation widget puts the messages with the people you care about front-and-center on your home screen so you never miss a chat from your loved ones. You can even see missed calls, birthdays and more at a glance.\n\nAccessibility Improvements\nBuilt for accessibility.\nAndroid 12 is designed to be even more accessible with new visibility features, including:\nArea magnification: A new window magnifier lets you zoom in on a part of your screen without having to lose context on the rest of the screen content.\nExtra dim: Make your display extra dim for night-time scrolling or situations when even the lowest brightness setting is too bright.\nBold text: See text more clearly with the ability to switch the font to bold across the whole phone.\nGrayscale: Adjust how colors display on your device to grayscale.\nMic & Camera Indicators and Toggles\nStronger mic and camera access controls.\nWith Android 12, you can see when an app is using your microphone or camera thanks to a new indicator in your phone\u2019s status bar. And if you don\u2019t want any apps to access your microphone or camera, you can completely disable those sensors using two new toggles in quick settings. Simply flip the switch.\nApproximate Location Permissions\nKeep your precise location private.\nWhile some apps need precise location information for tasks like turn-by-turn navigation, many other apps only need your approximate location to be helpful. With Android 12, you can choose between giving apps access to your precise location or an approximate location instead.\n\nPrivacy Dashboard\nYour privacy permissions at a glance.\nPrivacy dashboard gives you a clear and comprehensive view of when apps access your location, camera, or mic over the past 24 hours. If you see anything that you\u2019re not comfortable with, you can manage permissions right from the dashboard.\n\nWe\u2019re also continuing our commitment to exceptional security through Thinkshield\u00ae for Mobile, which offers enhanced protection via a secured chain of trust and additional security certifications.\n\nEnhanced Gaming\nKick-start your gameplay.\nSpend less time waiting and more time playing. Android 12 lets you play as you download, so you can jump straight into gameplay without needing to wait for the full download to finish.1 And Moto Gametime takes the whole experience to the next level, giving you advanced controls that allow you to block notifications, screen record, and control the audio while playing your favorite games.\n\nEasily Switch Phones\nSwitching made easy.\nIt\u2019s never been easier to switch to Android and try out the best device for you. Starting on Android 12, you can transfer all your essentials by connecting your old phone to your new Android with a cable or shared WiFi connection. Your memories and data will transfer, stress free \u2013 even from iPhone\u00ae (welcome!) \nThese are just a handful of updates you can expect in this Android 12 update. Users can expect even more software features like new My UX experiences, new camera features and new Ready For2 experiences to become available in 2022.  \nAndroid\u2122 12 OS comes with big changes but we\u2019re hard at work finalizing our Android 12 OS + My UX experience. Android 12 is currently undergoing beta testing with our Motorola Feedback Network, and our official Android 12 rollout will begin in February 2022.

But these days, it is becoming increasingly common across all tiers of mobile devices to find smartphones with 90Hz, 120Hz or even 144Hz refresh rate displays,  previously exclusive to high-end devices. Much of this improvement can be associated with technological advances \u2013 but for Motorola, it comes from an understanding of consumer needs. As consumers spend more time on their phones, catching up on the news, scrolling through social media and watching their favorite shows \u2013 the need for better refresh rates has become clear.\nSo as better refresh rates become more common, we\u2019re uncovering what refresh rate is, what makes a refresh rate \u2018good\u2019, and why it's relevant \u2013 not just among gamers \u2014 but for all smartphone users.\nWhat is a refresh rate?\nAlthough it may not seem like it, the screens of our smartphones are constantly turning on and off. It shows an image and turns off in milliseconds, constantly. The human eye makes sure that we cannot see that process - a phenomenon known as  \"retinal persistence\".  Exactly, the one that made cinematography possible in the late nineteenth century, which was nothing more than a rapid succession of photographs.\nThe Hertz of a screen is then the number of times an image turns on and off per second. So a  60Hz display would refresh the image 60 times, 90Hz would refresh 90 times, and so on. This happens thanks to constant communication with the GPU, the chip that is responsible for \"telling\" the screen what it has to project. All in milliseconds. \nWhat are the benefits of a faster refresh rate?\nFaster refresh rates allow for smoother animations and harmonic scrolling, without losing detail. And when it comes to gaming, the benefit is even clearer: no detail of what is happening on the screen is lost, a key feature for those games where you need to react quickly.  More Hz means a better screen experience.  \nDoesn't that consume more battery? It is true and hence the response of the manufacturers. The moto g20, for example, is an accessible cell phone with a 90Hz screen that includes a 5,000 mAh battery, enough for more than two days of autonomy. And when setting up the device's display, users can choose the refresh rate they want, 60Hz or 90Hz, so you have the ability to control when you want to use a better refresh rate or when you want to conserve some battery.\nThe 90Hz screens also raise the refresh rate and perception of fluidity by 50% compared to previous generations of smartphones with 60Hz screens. This percentage is even higher in devices such as the moto g60, which has a 120Hz  display, and the new motorola edge 20 pro and motorola edge 20 and on the moto g 200, which have a 144Hz display, the fastest refresh rate in the industry.\nWhat features or apps do refresh rate impact on my smartphone?\nIn addition to gaming, the benefits of a good refresh rate can be seen in most of the actions we take during the day, including scrolling for a contact, checking your emails, reading the news, jumping from one app to another, and browsing social media.\nIt's clear that having a good refresh rate can enhance our daily smartphone experiences. And at Motorola, we believe it\u2019s important to bring these better refresh rates to more consumers across various price points.  \nLegal Disclaimers\nCertain features, functionality and product specifications may be network dependent and subject to additional terms, conditions, and charges.

Today, with the publication of Lenovo's 2020\/21 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report, we reflect on our fifteenth year of sustainability efforts, acknowledge the progress we\u2019ve made, and outline how we are moving forward.\n\nRead more about the report here. ","29":"As summer vacation comes to a close, teachers, students and parents alike are preparing to head back to school. Whether that\u2019s completely virtual, hybrid or in-person, technology is helping to improve the educational experience so students can continue to get the best possible education no matter if they\u2019re in the classroom or in their kitchen. And Motorola\u2019s Ready For software platform is one of them. \n\nReady For unleashes the power of the smartphone by providing new ways of interacting across devices and amplifying everyday experiences to larger displays. And when it comes to education - teachers, students and parents can all reap the benefits of an intuitive, immersive platform like Ready For. \nThe Teacher\nReady For lets users activate advanced subject tracking** when video calling & recording. The advanced subject tracking feature automatically determines the best camera to use, tracks movement and zooms in and out to ensure you\u2019re always front and center, regardless of if you\u2019re writing on the whiteboard or sitting at your desk. \n\nAnd with Ready For PC\u00b9, teachers can also more easily multitask during lessons. By simply downloading the Ready For assistant application on your Windows device and scanning a QR code,  your Ready For Mobile Desktop will appear on your Windows screen, so you can text your colleagues status updates or attendance records while also teaching a new lesson. \nThe Student\nIn addition to leveraging advanced subject tracking for A+ worthy presentations, Ready For lets students use their phone as their PC by connecting to a TV* and using a mouse and keyboard. This means students can use existing technology around the house, like a TV, to easily view pre-recorded lectures, review class notes, and study materials  content on a larger screen. \n\nFor those students who do have a PC, Ready For PC\u00b9 will make it easier to stay focused as it brings all your notifications to one screen, so there's no need to switch back and forth between devices or open unnecessary tabs.\nThe Parent\nWhether you are constantly trying to find the charger to the laptop or making sure your child is actually doing their homework, as a parent, you no longer need to stress about keeping track of all your child\u2019s technology. Because with Ready For, you can use one device - the phone. Wirelessly connect to a TV*, so you can see the homework while still being able to use your phone to check the answers (because let\u2019s be honest 5th graders are smarter than most of us). And you\u2019ll never hear: \u201cI forgot to bring my school computer\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t have my homework assignment with me\u201d, again. Now it\u2019s all on one device.\n\nReady For is available on motorola edge 20 pro, motorola edge 20 and motorola edge 2021, edge+ and g100. Ready For PC is available on motorola edge 20 pro, motorola edge 20, motorola edge (2021) and motorola edge 20 lite.\n\nTo learn more about our Ready For platform and its capabilities, please visit our website. \nLegal Disclaimers\nCertain features, functionality and product specifications may be network dependent and subject to additional terms, conditions, and charges.
