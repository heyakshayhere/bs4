2,"JANUARY 28, 2022",Motorola’s top tech predictions for 2022,"As we welcome in another new year, the possibilities of how we will continue incorporating tech into our ever-changing world seem endless. While it’s exhilarating to hear about emerging technologies and trends ahead from industry experts, what about the everyday people using tech for good in their professions, hobbies and beyond?
To help us paint a better picture of what is to come in 2022, innovators at Motorola shared a few notable predictions for the year ahead. From more solutions for hybrid work models to a focus on tech as a force for good, here are Motorola’s 2022 tech predictions.
#1: Work-from-anywhere as the new Work-from-Home
2022 will kickstart the evolution from work-from-home to work-from-anywhere. Tech companies all across the globe are allowing employees to work from home longer or even permanently, given the advantages of remote work, and we foresee this trend continuing well into the future.  
That’s why, this year, we predict an increase in products, solutions and services designed to improve the remote employee experience. New office designs and audio/video technology will also pave the way for flexible meeting setups and new ways to build social connections. No longer will consumers have to adjust to adequate technology or products.  Instead, products will cater to emerging consumer needs allowing them to thrive wherever they choose to work.  For example, we predict Artificial intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR) solutions will create immersive workplaces for employees no matter where they are, with innovations such as Ready For1, which enable motorola devices like the moto g100 to tether to ThinkReality A3 Smart Glasses allowing for an extended mobile desktop, video, gaming and entertainment experiences in augmented reality.
#2: Tech for Good
Tech access and inclusivity will - and should - be a major focus for the mobile industry in 2022 and beyond. We predict more mobile tech innovations being released that better help represent languages, disabilities, gender and racial groups. For example, we at Motorola launched our Indigenous Languages program earlier this year, where our devices now support two languages deemed “endangered.” This is just the first of many milestones we hope to achieve in our indigenous languages project - we can’t wait to unveil more on this in the near future. 
We think we’ll see more innovations released like this, especially those with languages, disabilities, and gender and racial groups being more represented.
#3: Monitors are having a moment
We predict the monitor will soon have all the features necessary to enhance connectivity and add more value at the office and home in 2022. Monitors will also complement additional devices beyond PCs and extend functionality to smartphones and gaming consoles.
Like Motorola’s Ready For platform, we predict tech companies will concentrate their efforts on developing software experiences for different types of displays and devices to be used seamlessly together. We’ve seen the expansion of monitors become essential for at home or work, and we think this continuity of content from one device to another will continue to bring new value and ease of use to consumers.  
#4: The proliferation of form factors
While we predicted 2021 as the year of foldables, the pandemic’s effect on supply chain impacted the timeline, leading us to believe 2022 will be the year of new and improved form factors. With the need to work from anywhere, consumers are considering new types of devices to make this a seamless experience.
We predict smartphones will continue to see new forms and improve with OLED technology, flexible hinges, and more, to help make work-from-anywhere a reality. We believe flexible displays will also come to other device concepts and form factors across smartphones, tablets, PCs and laptops.  Flexible displays will also bring rise to new applications on digital signage, public transport and smart home appliances in the year ahead.

3,"DECEMBER 21, 2021",Android 12 + My UX: More personal and effortless than ever,"At Motorola, we believe consumers deserve the most pure Android OS possible, without clunky software skins or duplicate apps. Instead, we build on the great things Google does with Android with a comprehensive suite of experiences called My UX, putting you in control of your mobile experience.  My UX encompasses all the great moto experiences, moto specific apps and unique customizations to take music, videos, games, and your phone's style to the next level. Whether it’s turning on the flashlight with a simple chop gesture, launching the camera with the twist of a wrist, bringing creativity to life with moto note or changing your icon shapes, color schemes and display font to fit your style – it’s all a part of My UX. 
And since My UX doesn’t get in the way of a pure Android experience, users get to make the most of new customizations and updates coming on Android 12. 
What to expect with your Android 12 Update  
Material You on Motorola Smartphones
Reflect your personal style across your whole device.
AndroidTM 12 rethinks the entire user interface, from shapes, light and motion, to customizable system colors that can be adapted to match you. Material You is Google’s material design language that elevates what we’ve already begun with My UX. It prioritizes simplicity while adding personal touches that let you control Android 12’s visual elements according to your preferences. Redesigned to be more spacious and comfortable, it’s the most expressive, dynamic and personal OS ever. 

Now, you can change the wallpaper on your device and your entire Android 12 experience changes to match. Using advanced color extraction algorithms, you can easily personalize the look and feel of your entire phone, including notifications, settings, widgets and even select apps. We’re combining the dynamic color, rounded shapes, and large open layouts from Material You with the rich, premium feel of the Motorola brand.  

Best of all, these settings are now centralized in one convenient place. Just access Personalize from the home screen menu, then make individual changes to font style and size, colors, icon shapes and layouts, device sounds, display size, and your wallpapers. 

Conversation Widgets
Control your connected devices from one place.
An all-new conversation widget puts the messages with the people you care about front-and-center on your home screen so you never miss a chat from your loved ones. You can even see missed calls, birthdays and more at a glance.

Accessibility Improvements
Built for accessibility.
Android 12 is designed to be even more accessible with new visibility features, including:
Area magnification: A new window magnifier lets you zoom in on a part of your screen without having to lose context on the rest of the screen content.
Extra dim: Make your display extra dim for night-time scrolling or situations when even the lowest brightness setting is too bright.
Bold text: See text more clearly with the ability to switch the font to bold across the whole phone.
Grayscale: Adjust how colors display on your device to grayscale.
Mic & Camera Indicators and Toggles
Stronger mic and camera access controls.
With Android 12, you can see when an app is using your microphone or camera thanks to a new indicator in your phone’s status bar. And if you don’t want any apps to access your microphone or camera, you can completely disable those sensors using two new toggles in quick settings. Simply flip the switch.
Approximate Location Permissions
Keep your precise location private.
While some apps need precise location information for tasks like turn-by-turn navigation, many other apps only need your approximate location to be helpful. With Android 12, you can choose between giving apps access to your precise location or an approximate location instead.

Privacy Dashboard
Your privacy permissions at a glance.
Privacy dashboard gives you a clear and comprehensive view of when apps access your location, camera, or mic over the past 24 hours. If you see anything that you’re not comfortable with, you can manage permissions right from the dashboard.

We’re also continuing our commitment to exceptional security through Thinkshield® for Mobile, which offers enhanced protection via a secured chain of trust and additional security certifications.

Enhanced Gaming
Kick-start your gameplay.
Spend less time waiting and more time playing. Android 12 lets you play as you download, so you can jump straight into gameplay without needing to wait for the full download to finish.1 And Moto Gametime takes the whole experience to the next level, giving you advanced controls that allow you to block notifications, screen record, and control the audio while playing your favorite games.

Easily Switch Phones
Switching made easy.
It’s never been easier to switch to Android and try out the best device for you. Starting on Android 12, you can transfer all your essentials by connecting your old phone to your new Android with a cable or shared WiFi connection. Your memories and data will transfer, stress free – even from iPhone® (welcome!) 
These are just a handful of updates you can expect in this Android 12 update. Users can expect even more software features like new My UX experiences, new camera features and new Ready For2 experiences to become available in 2022.  
Android™ 12 OS comes with big changes but we’re hard at work finalizing our Android 12 OS + My UX experience. Android 12 is currently undergoing beta testing with our Motorola Feedback Network, and our official Android 12 rollout will begin in February 2022. For future roll out updates, Motorola device owners can visit our software support page to learn more.

4,"DECEMBER 16, 2021","The Power of Design, Meet Lewis Suaton","Lewis Suaton is a fashion designer based out of Paris, France, studying psychology. While some people might think the fashion industry is manipulated by the market, Lewis believes it’s actually people and their daily routines that are influencing the trends coming to the fashion industry.  
It’s always been his dream to unite his two passions of psychology and fashion design. With the help of his phone, Lewis scans for present references - everywhere,  even in people’s daily routines - to identify and predict what the next trend will be for the industry. “Technology has been helping me in my quest to ‘design the future’,” said Lewis. “It has given me the tools to capture so many images of what I later analyze and use for the concepts I am interested in regarding fashion and my creations.”
In the future, Lewis’ goal is to collaborate with fashion brands to help them understand new trends and use more upcycling.  In turn, Lewis hopes to create a more sustainable industry.

5,"DECEMBER 15, 2021",Understanding the advantages of refresh rates,"When smartphones were first introduced, most of them had 60Hz refresh rates – and improvements were mostly being made to meet the needs of mobile gamers.  But these days, it is becoming increasingly common across all tiers of mobile devices to find smartphones with 90Hz, 120Hz or even 144Hz refresh rate displays,  previously exclusive to high-end devices. Much of this improvement can be associated with technological advances – but for Motorola, it comes from an understanding of consumer needs. As consumers spend more time on their phones, catching up on the news, scrolling through social media and watching their favorite shows – the need for better refresh rates has become clear.
So as better refresh rates become more common, we’re uncovering what refresh rate is, what makes a refresh rate ‘good’, and why it's relevant – not just among gamers — but for all smartphone users.
What is a refresh rate?
Although it may not seem like it, the screens of our smartphones are constantly turning on and off. It shows an image and turns off in milliseconds, constantly. The human eye makes sure that we cannot see that process - a phenomenon known as  ""retinal persistence"".  Exactly, the one that made cinematography possible in the late nineteenth century, which was nothing more than a rapid succession of photographs.
The Hertz of a screen is then the number of times an image turns on and off per second. So a  60Hz display would refresh the image 60 times, 90Hz would refresh 90 times, and so on. This happens thanks to constant communication with the GPU, the chip that is responsible for ""telling"" the screen what it has to project. All in milliseconds. 
What are the benefits of a faster refresh rate?
Faster refresh rates allow for smoother animations and harmonic scrolling, without losing detail. And when it comes to gaming, the benefit is even clearer: no detail of what is happening on the screen is lost, a key feature for those games where you need to react quickly.  More Hz means a better screen experience.  
Doesn't that consume more battery? It is true and hence the response of the manufacturers. The moto g20, for example, is an accessible cell phone with a 90Hz screen that includes a 5,000 mAh battery, enough for more than two days of autonomy. And when setting up the device's display, users can choose the refresh rate they want, 60Hz or 90Hz, so you have the ability to control when you want to use a better refresh rate or when you want to conserve some battery.
The 90Hz screens also raise the refresh rate and perception of fluidity by 50% compared to previous generations of smartphones with 60Hz screens. This percentage is even higher in devices such as the moto g60, which has a 120Hz  display, and the new motorola edge 20 pro and motorola edge 20 and on the moto g 200, which have a 144Hz display, the fastest refresh rate in the industry.
What features or apps do refresh rate impact on my smartphone?
In addition to gaming, the benefits of a good refresh rate can be seen in most of the actions we take during the day, including scrolling for a contact, checking your emails, reading the news, jumping from one app to another, and browsing social media.
It's clear that having a good refresh rate can enhance our daily smartphone experiences. And at Motorola, we believe it’s important to bring these better refresh rates to more consumers across various price points.

6,"DECEMBER 8, 2021","The Power of Connection, Meet Daniel Juarez","Based out of Los Angeles, CA, Daniel Juarez loves creating songs and vocal arrangements. But for Daniel, what he loves most is being able to share this passion with others. 
“My dream has always been to form my own vocal band,” said Danile. “Not so long ago, I carried out a deep search for the perfect voices to join me and after meeting Angelo and David, I created Saturday Nights. We are now recording our first songs together and I can’t believe how great this is, even more than I had imagined.”
Daniel and his band are always preparing new original material, sending each other their melodies and looking for inspiration. That’s why technology has played such an important role in Daniel’s journey. He also turns to technology to help him share his music with others, because for Daniel it doesn’t make sense to create music if he’s not sharing it with the world.

11,"NOVEMBER 11, 2021",New Motorola 312 Labs set up to invent the future,"Today, Motorola introduces Motorola 312 Labs, a newly chartered internal innovation group within the Motorola product organization, comprising global research, design and engineering experts focused on first-of-its-kind product development. This group will explore the unknown through research, ideation, concepting, and prototyping to usher in radically different mobile solutions and technologies in both the near and distant future. The introduction of the Motorola 312 Labs R&D group at Motorola, a Lenovo company, further supports Lenovo’s mission to double investment in R&D over the next three years.
Motorola’s business has seen impressive growth and profitability, recording its best quarter ever, with profit reaching a new historic high of US$89 million, while revenue grew 27% year-on-year to the highest in 15 quarters. This is thanks to a core portfolio of products like motorola razr, motorola edge and moto g, and services like ThinkShield for mobile and Moto Talk.
Motorola has brought incredible innovation to market such as shatterproof screens, moto mods and the foldable razr, and Motorola 312 Labs will continue to accelerate new technologies to market and assist the wider Lenovo Group. Looking ahead, Motorola 312 Labs is focused on a few key research areas including the connected ecosystem of the future, metaverse evolution, exploring new and unique mobile form factors and wearables, advancing displays, and AR & VR technologies. 
“Motorola 312 Labs is uniquely positioned as its mission is to explore the unknown but with a research team that has the expertise to turn a conceptual idea into a reality.” Said Dan Dery, Motorola Vice President of Product.  “One of our expertise is understanding the needs of customers, because what’s the point of breakthrough if it doesn’t mean anything to people? That’s a key focus area for Motorola 312 Labs as it looks to the future of mobile technology.” 
Motorola 312 Lab’s employees review a 3D printed component in the HQ Model Shop.
Global Team of Experts with Roots in Chicago
The name “312” was chosen as it’s one of Chicago’s most well-known telephone area codes.  Motorola’s innovation has deep roots in Chicago, IL, USA, supporting iconic devices from the first portable phone to the first clamshell foldable. The team is headquartered in Chicago’s iconic Merchandise Mart, where employees work in over 30 labs, working alongside colleagues in Brazil, China and India.
Working with the values instilled by Lenovo’s Product Diversity Office, Motorola 312 Labs will continue to build a  diverse team and ensure a mix of disciplines are brought into fold throughout the innovation process. For example, from a consumer research perspective, a screening process ensures a representative sample of various ages, genders, abilities and races are included in our sessions. This is fundamental to our process.

15,"OCTOBER 27, 2021","A Smarter, More Inclusive Future for All","As a Lenovo company, Motorola has a vision to provide smarter technology that builds a smarter, more inclusive future for our colleagues and communities. During Global Diversity Awareness Month, we’re excited to announce new goals that build on the accomplishments of 2020 and seek to increase diversity in our leadership while fostering more inclusion in our workplace and products.
In 2020, Lenovo’s first Chief Diversity Officer Yolanda Conyers set our first generation of workforce diversity goals in place. After achieving 21% representation of women executives and 29% representation of U.S. underrepresented racial and ethnic groups in our executive ranks, we have taken 2021 to reassess, align with our Diversity & Inclusion board of executives, and analyze our progress toward a more inclusive future.

Lenovo will maintain its focus on diversity in executive ranks, with goals to grow female executive representation to 27% and executives from U.S historically underrepresented ethnic and racial groups to 35% by 2025. In addition to our executive representation goals, we are implementing programs to strengthen our internal pipeline of diverse talent at early and mid-career levels. We’re also expanding our understanding of disabilities in our workforce through our disability inclusion initiative, which seeks to measure, understand, and better accommodate the needs of our employees who experience both visible and invisible disabilities. Initially launched during Global Accessibility Awareness Month in the U.S., we plan to expand this initiative to 8 markets around the world by 2025.

Finally, we know that as a technology company, we have a responsibility to not just provide inclusive and equitable opportunities in our workforce, but to ensure the technology we make is truly for all. Lenovo formed the Product Diversity Office in 2019 to ensure that our products met the needs of people from all backgrounds and abilities. We’re focused on taking the office’s function and processes to scale so that by 2025, 75% of our products will be vetted for inclusion by design experts.
As a global company with employees in more than 60 countries, Lenovo is reliant on the principles of diversity and inclusion. Our diverse, global workforce is an incredible strength for our business, and it also helps us understand the unique needs and contexts of communities around the world. Through the work of Lenovo Foundation, we share our strengths of diversity and innovation with communities around the world by providing contributions of funds, products, and employee time and talent to increase access to technology and education. 
We are honored to harness the passion of our employees to enable digital and technology access for youth and transform the lives of adults as they upskill for the 21st century. We’re working to impact 15 million lives by 2025 through our programs and partnerships that provide access to technology and education for the next generation. However, we’re aware that the connectivity gap exists now, and has continued to widen since the onset of the pandemic. While we work to ensure that the next generation of youth is not left out of technology’s innovation, we’re focused on transforming one million lives by providing opportunities that help adults learn new skills and earn better opportunities in today’s workforce.
Throughout global diversity awareness month, we’ll be sharing other stories of innovation and inclusion as we continue our efforts to provide a more inclusive future – not just for our own workforce, but for all.",https://www.motorola.com/blog/post?id=375,https://motorolablog.myvtex.com/arquivos/2021_BRAND_LIFESTYLESHOOT_DAY_GROUP_WITHOUTDEVICE_4846.jpg

Currently ranked number two in the world for Judo within his category and a professional obstacle course racer, Jamie has never let the challenges he’s faced get in the way of his dreams -  including a below-knee amputation. 
Although Jamie now has several accolades under his belt, when his condition first started, he had little information and resources to rely on. That’s why once Jamie’s story gained attention on social media, he decided to create his own blog where he could share the vital information he did not have access to following his own surgery. Jamie hopes to be an inspiration to other young people trying to overcome similar challenges and believes his blog can serve as a resource for them. 
For Jamie, technology has played a huge role in his life. It’s helped him help others and also helped him with his own journey and recognizing his strength both physically and emotionally.

Last year, he closed his catering business and moved from east London to the countryside to pursue his passion for the natural world, ecology and horticulture - specifically involving plants that can feed and heal us. Being a chef, Mitchell knew a lot about food, but not a lot about growing it. After some practice and nearly seven billion YouTube views later, he’s grown his kitchen garden into an impressive all organic permaculture. 
Mitchell uses a lot of tools to grow his food sustainably, but most important to him has been his mobile phone. It helped him learn how to start his organic garden from zero, and create more contacts in the industry. He’s even started teaching others all about growing through his own radio show. 
""I felt proud to be asked to take part in the campaign. It showed me that all my hard work hadn’t gone unnoticed. Reflecting back, I
had lots of fun filming and creating the content for Motorola,"" said Mitchell, when asked about his expereince working with Motorola.  ""Being involved has accelerated my motivation to make the world a better place through the power of growing and teaching. Overall it was an enlightening experience, I now see it as the beginning of a long journey to becoming the person I want to be!""
Mitchell has been around food his whole career, but the power of growing it himself has given him a new purpose.

With these stories, we want to reassure people that technology is for everyone and that when applied well it can empower both you and your communities to achieve your greatest potential. 
With the help of The Masses and the direction of Juan Amusategui, these stories were narrated by people of different countries (Argentina, Chile, France, Colombia, UK, US, Taiwan Region, India and Hong Kong), realities, languages, races, and cultures. Bringing this to life required a truly global collaboration - interacting with people from 18 nationalities, creating more than 20 Terabytes of data, and working across 21 countries.
Be sure to check back weekly as we unveil their stories! First up, a story about a deaf dancer from Taiwan who uses technology to learn and dance with people all across the country. Technology today empowers us and connects us in many different ways. It helps us overcome limits and supports us as we define and work towards new goals, regardless of nationality, age, gender or race.
Behind Power to Empower
Power To Empower, the Motorola brand platform was created by WTF Agency to encourage people to fulfill their goals, express themselves, connect and unleash their inner voices through the power of technology. Through Motorola’s technology, we are determined to help our users embrace their inner power and create positive change.
“Last year changed the lives of everyone and from Motorola, we needed to show to millions of people all over the world that technology can support their lives positively and to show them a better future,” said Renata Altenfelder, Global Director Brand Marketing at Motorola. “It was an interesting challenge that encouraged us to create this new concept and that will serve as an incredible brand platform.”
In July, the team kicked off the Power To Empower platform with a film that brought the essence of the concept through real people and their stories.

Technology is at the center of our daily lives and has become even more crucial as we thrive into this next reality.  Whether we're still working from home or back to traveling the world, we're now more dependent than ever on technology to keep us connected and entertained.

Today at Lenovo Tech World ‘21, Sergio Buniac, SVP of Lenovo’s Mobile Business Group and Motorola’s President, along with other key spokespeople at Motorola unveiled experiences that will empower consumers, transform and ease the way they interact with technology. Here are some of the major highlights from Motorola at Lenovo Tech World ‘21: 
Unleashing the power of your smartphone
At Motorola, we understand that smartphones have become so much more than just being a tool for communication - they are the hub for information, entertainment, productivity and even content creation.

And what better way to elevate those experiences, than to bring them to the big screen and beyond with Ready For, a platform that unleashes the power of our smartphones by connecting with multiple screens* and working seamlessly with our Lenovo PCs.

Together with Lenovo, we are bringing unified experiences to the market. For example, thanks to Ready For you can now connect your phone to a monitor, a PC, and even explore AR with Lenovo’s ThinkReality A3 smart glasses.*
A new era of wearable technology
In addition to Ready For, we also previewed a new era of wearable devices that will change the way we interact with the world around us all powered by 5G technology.

As we look at a world where the smartphone can seamlessly connect to purpose-driven displays, PCs and glasses, we are working to address the needs of our consumers.

We all want a more portable smartphone - something easy to put in your pocket or perhaps easy to wear without feeling its presence.  During today’s event, we demonstrated a wearable 5G form factor that always keeps you connected and allows you to display content to the bigger screens around you. 
Seamless charging through over-the-air power
Finally, Tech World ‘21 also showcased a collaboration with GuRu Wireless, Inc. and Salom Electric Co. to bring an over-the-air wireless power solution to Motorola smartphones in the future through a seamless charging demonstration. With this, we will allow users to charge multiple phones at the same time without the limitations of wires or charging pads, so they can stay connected no matter what.

While we announced our partnership earlier this year, today’s event reinforces our joint progress towards transforming the way we live and bringing freedom and flexibility to consumers by easily keeping their devices charged.

With each of these concepts, platforms and experiences, Motorola continues its mission to deliver meaningful and innovative, on-the-go solutions that improve mobility, pocketability and overall convenience for consumers. And looking ahead, we will bring devices and solutions to our customers under One Lenovo.

For those students who do have a PC, Ready For PC¹ will make it easier to stay focused as it brings all your notifications to one screen, so there's no need to switch back and forth between devices or open unnecessary tabs.
The Parent
Whether you are constantly trying to find the charger to the laptop or making sure your child is actually doing their homework, as a parent, you no longer need to stress about keeping track of all your child’s technology. Because with Ready For, you can use one device - the phone. Wirelessly connect to a TV*, so you can see the homework while still being able to use your phone to check the answers (because let’s be honest 5th graders are smarter than most of us). And you’ll never hear: “I forgot to bring my school computer” or “I don’t have my homework assignment with me”, again. Now it’s all on one device.

Ready For is available on motorola edge 20 pro, motorola edge 20 and motorola edge 2021, edge+ and g100. Ready For PC is available on motorola edge 20 pro, motorola edge 20, motorola edge (2021) and motorola edge 20 lite.
