2,31/03/2022,The Earthquake Early Warning Function on Xiaomi Smartphone is Now Coming to Serve the Indonesian People,"The Earthquake Early Warning Function on Xiaomi Smartphone is Now Coming to Serve the Indonesian People
31/03/20222608 Views
Xiaomi works with disaster prevention and mitigation institutions of both Indonesia and China to launch the trial run of the new feature, aiming to better help Indonesian people to protect themselves during earthquakes
Jakarta, INDONESIA, March 31, 2022 - Xiaomi, a consumer electronics and smart manufacturing company with smartphones and smart hardware connected by an IoT platform at its core, has announced the launch of its trial run of Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) feature for Indonesia. By switching on the feature, Xiaomi smartphone users in Indonesia can now be immediately notified of the seismic intensity and the location of the earthquake when it occurs nearby. This advanced earthquake warning plays a crucial role in preserving life-saving time for affected residents to make the most effective protective measures.
What is Earthquake Early Warning and how to activate the function?
Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) gives people seconds to tens of seconds warning time prior to the arrival of secondary waves, by leveraging the speed of electric waves that is naturally much faster than the speed of secondary waves. When the feature is being enabled on Xiaomi smartphones, once the earthquake monitoring agency detects an earthquake, it will synchronize the early warning information to the Xiaomi server through a dedicated channel. Xiaomi will then use the priority channel to push early warning information to users in the affected areas instantly.
Every notification from EEW will display the magnitude of a given earthquake, its ETA (estimated time of arrival), as well as the intensity that will be alarmed on the smartphone and delivered by countdown. The prerequisite for each smartphone to trigger an earthquake warning is the estimated intensity of the surrounding area, but the countdown and intensity displayed by people in different positions may be varied. Indonesia's earthquake warning alarm will be issued only when the earthquake intensity reaches 4 or above, or MMI (Modified Mercalli Intensity) scale used by The Agency for Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics of the Republic of Indonesia (BMKG). Data connection is needed for this feature.
The EEW function is compatible with Xiaomi smartphones with MIUI 12, MIUI 12.5 and MIUI 13 in Indonesia. Xiaomi Indonesia has completed its beta testing phase for the supporting models before deciding to expand it to more users. The function is turned off by default and requires users’ authorization to be turned on out of the consideration of users' privacy. The phone will ring a warning tone when the early warning occurs. Xiaomi recommends its users to listen to the warning tone to familiarize themselves beforehand. Xiaomi welcomes users to observe and give feedback to local MIUI community during the trial run. For more information on how to activate the function on your Xiaomi smartphone and its display, please click here.
How did the EEW function arrive on Xiaomi smartphones in Indonesia?
The EEW technology was developed by Institute of Care-life (ICL), China which has been doing the research since 2008. ICL has successfully sent out warnings of destructive earthquakes up to 65 times without any false or missing alerts so far in China.
In 2019, ICL and The Agency for Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics of the Republic of Indonesia (BMKG) conducted in-depth cooperation to introduce this technology to Indonesia. The technology was brought with the hope of helping more Indonesian people to receive earthquake warnings and mitigate the loss of life and property.
Meanwhile, Xiaomi has been cooperating with ICL in China for years, taking the lead in implementing ICL's EEW function on Xiaomi smartphones. Xiaomi has become the world's first smartphone brand with the EEW function on the operating system level. Currently, the EEW feature is functioning well in the Mainland China.
As ICL and BMKG brought the EEW function to Indonesia, Xiaomi also started the project to enable the function on its smartphones in the country. This makes Indonesia the second market in the world to receive the Earthquake Early Warnings on Xiaomi smartphones.
Rahmat Triyono, Head of the Center for Engineering Seismology, Potential Geophysics and Time Signs of the BMKG, said, ""We welcome the next stage of the trial implementing an earthquake early warning system on Xiaomi smartphones. We will continue to evaluate the success and failure rate of this system in Indonesia. We hope that this feature will be useful for Indonesian citizens.""
Why did we carry out this project?
Wang Tun, Director of Institute of Care-life (ICL), China, said, ""Indonesia is located on the most active seismic belt in the world - the Circum-Pacific seismic belt, which makes Indonesia a typical earthquake-prone country. Now that the EEW function is released on Xiaomi smartphones in Indonesia, it will allow more Indonesian people to receive earthquake early warnings more easily through their mobile devices and better serve the well-being of their lives and property.""
""Xiaomi appreciates the support from the Indonesian government for the project. Xiaomi Fans and consumers in Indonesia have always been very supportive of our brand, of which we are in great appreciation. Through this initiative, we hope that we can help Indonesian people and give back to the local community. This is one of the many CSR actions that we have undertaken in Indonesia as socially responsive cooperation,"" said Alvin Tse, Country Director of Xiaomi Indonesia.
Zhu Xi, Technology Committee topic convener on Tech for Good, Xiaomi Corporation, said, ""It is a great honor for Xiaomi to participate in this meaningful initiative. After working along with various stakeholders for more than one year, the MIUI Security Center team has obtained great trust and support from the Indonesian government. During the trial run period, we hope that Xiaomi users will turn on this function and engage in its user experience improvement through social media platforms and feedback channels.""
According to the introduction from Zhu Xi, Xiaomi always puts value on improving everyone's quality of life through technology. As one of the key departments of Xiaomi, Technology Committee not only leads the company's innovation in Hypercharge, foldable smartphone, liquid lens camera, and others alike, but also takes charge of increasing awareness of taking public preventative measures in areas of natural disasters and its related technological advancement and accessibility improvements.

Built with outstanding performance, fast charging, and immersive viewing, both phones were designed with hardcore users in mind. Featuring the latest MediaTek processors, Dimensity 8100 and Dimensity 9000, this also marks the first time Redmi phones feature 2K displays, accelerating the access of high quality viewing to the masses. These leading features alongside OIS, dual speakers with Dolby Atmos, X-axis haptic motor, mean two devices offering exceptional all-round experience. In addition, a newly-upgraded Redmi K40S and selection of exciting AIoT products will also be making their way to market.
Redmi K50 Pro is available starting at RMB 2,999, while Redmi K50 starts at RMB 2,399.

Along with other heat dissipation materials, such as 7 layers of graphite, copper sheeting, and thermal paste, these form a 3D dissipation system to support ultimate performance for both devices.
Even more fascinating is the balance between compact size and huge battery in the Redmi K50 series. Using the self-developed 4:1 Surge P1, the 120W fast charge capable Redmi K50 Pro comes with a large 5,000mAh battery. With a charging time of just 19 minutes,* Redmi K50 Pro offers a phenomenal balance between power, charging, and design. Redmi K50 is equipped with 67W charging, with a slightly larger battery at 5,500mAh, but identical thickness.
Flagship viewing and sound with 2K display and dual speakers
Redmi K50 and Redmi K50 Pro use identical 6.67-inch 2K Samsung AMOLED displays. The flexible flat design improves the front display effect and reduces accidental edge touch during operation. In terms of optical performance, the resolution is a max 3200*1440 at 526PPI. Peak brightness is 1200nit with refresh rates of 120Hz. Each screen is factory color calibrated, improving color accuracy and reducing individual differences to a JNCD≈0.36 and Delta E≈0.45. Redmi K50 Pro has also passed DisplayMate A+ certification, achieving 16 record scores. Additionally, the front display uses Corning Gorilla Victus, which compared with anti-drop performance improved 1.5 times and scratch resistance improved 2 times versus the previous generation.
In addition to hardware, Redmi K50 and Redmi K50 Pro also integrate advanced display technologies, such as full DC dimming effectively reducing stroboscopic issues when brightness is low. In terms of automatic brightness, it supports 16,000-level automatic brightness adjustment and a light sensor which makes automatic adjustment more accurate and natural when transitioning. Through a color temperature sensor, ambient light color temperature can be captured allowing the display to accurately suit surroundings. P3 color gamut support, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision, ensure rich, colorful visuals with compatible content. For gaming, it supports super-resolution touch technology, which increases touch performance by 10 times enabling a more refined competitive experience.
Top-of-the-line display meets powerful sound for an overall excellent audio-visual experience. Redmi K50 and Redmi K50 Pro are equipped with dual stereo speakers supporting Dolby Atmos. Additionally, Bluetooth 5.3 standard and newly added LC3 audio codec support offer lower power consumption and latency than traditional SBC coding. With the LC3, delay is reduced, one of the few pain points of Bluetooth audio today.
Flagship experience with camera, network, and haptic upgrades
Redmi K50 Pro implements a 100-megapixel ultra-clear triple camera setup, and optical image stabilization greatly improving performance for hand-held shooting. Electronic image stabilization can also be enabled during video shooting to reduce the impact of hand stability during recording. Redmi has also optimized the 100-megapixel camera experience to improve shutter speed and video performance overall. As secondary cameras, Redmi K50 Pro implements 2MP macro lens and 8MP 119° ultra-wide lenses. Redmi K50 features a 48MP main camera with OIS, in a triple camera setup.

03/03/20222936 Views
Beijing, CHINA, March 3, 2022 – Xiaomi, a consumer electronics and smart manufacturing company with smartphones and smart hardware connected by an IoT platform at its core, is proud to announce that it has been invited to participate in three research projects being convened by 3GPP, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project, a key international organization in the development of mobile communication standards. Xiaomi will be leading these three projects and working with global partners to explore innovative communication technologies.
These three projects were approved as part of 3GPP Release-18 — an agreed system to provide technology developers with a stable platform for the implementation of features — and include research on 3GPP RAN (Radio Access Network) and 3GPP SA (Service & System Aspects). Xiaomi welcomes the opportunity to collaborate with other industry leaders and partners to contribute to the development of the global mobile communication industry. Below is a brief overview of each project:
Research Project 1: The In-Device Coexistence (IDC) project for 3GPP RAN Release-18 aims to solve the problem of wireless self-interference inside the terminal equipment, which has long plagued operators and terminal manufacturers worldwide. Right now, multiple wireless communication signals coexist in a smartphone at the same time, such as 2/3/4/5G cellular networks, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and satellite positioning, which require distinct wireless transceivers in the same device. The transceivers also interfere with each other at the physical level, and for users, the interference can affect the sound quality on voice calls, and the strength of a device’s Wi-Fi connection. The 3GPP research on IDC technology will facilitate coordination between terminals and networks to avoid mutual interference of electromagnetic waves, allowing devices to use multiple wireless modules more smoothly at the same time. It will improve user experience and make future smartphones compatible for more features.
Research Project 2: The Ranging Based Services and Sidelink Positioning project of 3GPP SA Release-18 aims to enable technology to measure relative distance and angles. This has a wide range of applications including for smart homes and offices, smart cities, object tracking, content sharing, and autonomous driving. Xiaomi and its partners will study how to use this technology on licensed, unlicensed or ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems) frequency for UEs in coverage, partial coverage or out of 5G coverage with or without the assistance of operator networks. The research is expected to contribute to the wider application of this technology and to securely empower the Internet of Things.
Research Project 3: The Satellite Access Phase 2 project of 3GPP SA Rel-18 will help solve the problem of discontinuous coverage of satellite signals — a problem relating to the absence of satellite coverage. This project will ensure that after a gap in satellite coverage, the 5G core networks enable the temporary storage of uplink and downlink mobile phone data and ensure low power consuming of the phone until the phone re-enters an area with satellite coverage.
Hong Wei, Head of the 3GPP Standards and Research, Standards and New Technology Department, Technology Committee at Xiaomi Group, said: ""As a world-leading smart manufacturing and consumer electronics company, Xiaomi is proud of its technological contributions in the fields of smartphones and IoT in recent years. We are honored to lead research projects for 3GPP standards, which reflects Xiaomi's industry-leading capabilities. This is the first time that Xiaomi has led research for a 3GPP Release. We are very grateful to 3GPP and its member companies for their trust and support. We hope to continue to strengthen the cooperation and exchange with industry partners, that all enterprises work together to build an innovative, convenient, friendly and interconnected world.""
As an authoritative international standards organization in the information and communication industry, 3GPP has been developing communication industry standards for more than 20 years, and guides the research direction for future wireless technology development globally. More than 200 active global manufacturers and operators are members of 3GPP, and the organization has successfully articulated widely-adopted international communication standards including 3G, 4G and 5G.

11,,Redmi K50G debuts in Mainland China ,"Redmi K50G debuts in Mainland China
16/02/20223561 Views
Beijing, CHINA, February 16, 2022 – Redmi today announced Redmi K50G in Mainland China. Made for gamers, Redmi K50G represents top-notched gaming performance as a part of this year's Redmi K series, starting from RMB 3,299.
Equipped with the latest generation Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 flagship mobile platform, Redmi K50G adopts a groundbreaking heat dissipation solution which separates heat sources, and features dual-zone temperature control. Combined premium heat dissipation components such as dual vapor chambers and large-area graphite, Redmi K50G ensures powerful, cool, and stable gaming performance for users.

Speed-inspired design
With a design inspired by sport automobiles, Redmi K50G features a streamlined body with well-crafted details. The overall design of the smartphone has a strong element surrounding built around an ""X"" shape – with subtle but powerful visual touches on the camera frame, speaker openings, notification lights, and volume keys. Redmi K50G has sharp lines, lightning emblazoning, and a 16 million-color notification light built into the camera module.

03/02/20222805 Views
Beijing, CHINA, February 3, 2022 – Xiaomi, a consumer electronics and smart manufacturing company with smartphones and smart hardware connected by an IoT platform at its core, has today announced the findings of an independent review into its data protection compliance.
Xiaomi appointed TRUSTe LLC, a subsidiary of TrustArc, to conduct an independent audit of its data protection and security management. The review comprehensively evaluated whether the processing of personal information conducted by Xiaomi is performed in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union (EU). The TRUSTe review summary states: ""The measures described in the GDPR Validation Assessment were suitably designed to provide reasonable assurance"" that all 40 GDPR Validation Requirements would be met.
As the first ever Chinese enterprise to receive certification from TRUSTe, Xiaomi continues to submit to outside scrutiny when it comes to data protection and user privacy, adopting the GDPR of the EU compliance assessment since 2018.
The Validation Requirements focus on program-level measures in eight areas: Integrated Governance, Risk Management, Resource Allocation, Policies and Standards, Processes, Awareness and Training, Monitoring and Assurance, and Reporting and Certification. A member of the Global Privacy Solutions team from TRUSTe validated that Xiaomi has met the applicable Validation Requirements.
Cui Baoqiu, Xiaomi Vice President and Chairman of Xiaomi Security and Privacy Committee, said the GDPR Validation Assessment is an important step in continuously enhancing the company's data and security compliance. Xiaomi strives to uphold the highest standards of user privacy policies and practices, particularly for its users in the EU, he added.
Cui Baoqiu stated: ""We regularly engage with TRUSTe, as well as other credible institutions globally to warrant that Xiaomi's user privacy protection, including GDPR compliance, keeps improving and perfecting its practices to offer our users reliable and trustworthy products and services. I'm very pleased to see that Xiaomi has completed TRUSTe's annual audit of GDPR privacy compliance, which demonstrates our commitment to privacy protection.""
TrustArc, which is based in the U.S., is a leading global privacy compliance and risk management company with decades of deep expertise and leadership in building and maturing comprehensive privacy programs and enabling continuous compliance, information governance, and data security.
User security and privacy is Xiaomi's top priority. In 2014, Xiaomi established its Security and Privacy Committee. In 2016, Xiaomi became the first Chinese enterprise to receive certification from TrustArc. Xiaomi adopted the GDPR of the EU compliance assessment in 2018, and continues to submit to outside scrutiny when it comes to data protection and user privacy. In 2019, Xiaomi security and privacy practices were certificated on ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27018. The company also published the first version of the MIUI security and privacy white paper.

26/01/202221474 Views
Beijing, China, January 26th 2022 – Xiaomi today introduced its next generation operation system, MIUI 13, to international markets during the global Redmi Note 11 Series launch. As of Q4 2021, MIUI monthly active users surpassed 500 million. This latest generation operating system offers an all-round upgrade with a focus on improving core experience—including faster storage, higher background process efficiency, smarter processing, and longer battery life—alongside useful features such as sidebar and widgets.
Elevating the core experience to a new level
MIUI 13 introduces Liquid Storage, a new system-level method of managing the way files are stored on devices. On traditional devices, as we constantly write and rewrite the data on our devices, over time the device’s storage ends up being fragmented. After just 36 months, this slows read and write speeds by as much as 50%*. This also affects how quickly you can access apps, and how quickly those apps can access their necessary resources — slowing down everything. Liquid Storage on MIUI 13 reduces fragmentation and actively manages stored data, improving defragmentation efficiency by up to 60%**. Long term, some other Android OS read and write speeds drop by as much as 50% after 36 months, while MIUI 13 retains up to 95%**—giving users a ""new"" experience longer, and prolonging device lifespan.
To further boost performance, MIUI 13's Atomized Memory, an ultra-fine memory management method, brings RAM efficiency to a new level. This feature analyzes how apps use memory and divides a single app's RAM usage processes into important and unimportant tasks. Then it closes all unimportant tasks, allowing apps to use memory only for what's important to you right now, enabling you to run more apps without sacrificing performance.
MIUI 13 also comes with Focused Algorithms, which dynamically allocates system resources based on usage scenarios, making MIUI more fluid and responsive. Without Focused Algorithms, smartphone processors distribute resources across all of your apps relatively equally. Focused Algorithms prioritizes the active app above all others, allowing the CPU to focus on important tasks, giving you faster speeds and higher performance where and when you need it.
Smart Balance is another powerful experience upgrade in MIUI 13. It's designed to automatically find the balance between performance and power consumption, so you can get the power and speed you need to stay on the go. With Smart Balance, overall battery life can be extended by up to 10% in MIUI 13***.
All-new features to improve efficiency and personalize experience
In addition to core experience improvements, MIUI 13 also introduces cool new features that let you customize and personalize your experience.
With all-new widgets****, users are able to personalize their smartphones with convenient modules and notifications in the App Vault or on the home screen. They make it a breeze to stay up to date with things like notifications, to-do lists, weather, and more. MIUI 13 supports widgets of different sizes. With 2×1, 2×2, 2×3, 4×2, and 4×4 options at hand, users can fit more important information on a single widget and place widgets where they may not have fit before.
Sidebar is another efficiency tool in MIUI 13, allowing you to access all your favorite apps in floating windows with just a swipe—without leaving your current app. This is perfect for multitaskers that want an easier way to pull up multiple apps at once, or quickly swap between them. Users can also customize the feature with up to 10 apps in the sidebar.

The following models will roll out MIUI 13 first wave in Q1 2022*****, with the release schedule for other devices to be gradually published on the MIUI website. Rollout schedule may vary by region.

Xiaomi releases Cyber Security Baseline for Consumer Internet of Things Device Version 2.0, a new global standards guideline on IoT, and, at the same time, announces Xiaomi Mesh System AX3000 has obtained BSI IoT Kitemark™ Certificate, two important steps to strengthen IoT security policies and practices
Beijing, CHINA, January 17th, 2022 – Xiaomi, a consumer electronics and smart manufacturing company that established the world's leading consumer AIoT (AI+IoT) platform, has published a new set of proposed global standards to support and reassure consumers about the security of their data while using IoT products.
The guideline entitled ""Cyber Security Baseline for Consumer Internet of Things Device Version 2.0"" *[1] aims to protect security and user privacy with a comprehensive set of requirements covering guidelines from device hardware, device software to device communication. It also states the requirements on data security and privacy, which include communication security, authentication and access control, secure boot, data deletion, etc. It is a security baseline that all Xiaomi smart devices should follow.
The guideline of Xiaomi meets the need of the consumer IoT industry as there is no such general standard that can be publicly queried and implemented. Now companies can use this guide to avoid some basic security and privacy protection risks, and to quickly improve the security and privacy protection capabilities of their IoT products.
Xiaomi owns the world's leading consumer AIoT platform. As of November 2021, Xiaomi's AIoT platform has connected more than 400 million devices, excluding smartphones and laptops, and there are more than 8 million users with 5 or more Xiaomi IoT devices around the world. Xiaomi offers the most comprehensive security protection to its users and explores the best industry solutions and common standards for other stakeholders.
The guideline comes as the British Standards Institution (BSI) confirmed that Xiaomi Mesh System AX3000 has obtained the BSI IoT Kitemark™ Certificate, which has undoubtably proved the high degree of consistency between the Cyber Security Baseline for Consumer Internet of Things Device of Xiaomi and the international IoT security standards held by BSI.
""Users' security and privacy is the top priority of Xiaomi, and we promise that this applies to all markets where we operate. I'm delighted to see that Xiaomi Mesh System AX3000 has also successfully joined the BSI Kitemark™ certification. Over the years, we have made great efforts to protect users' security and privacy. I'm confident and proud to say that Xiaomi is in the leading position of IoT security policies and practices in the world, and we will continue to work hard to build a better IoT ecosystem for our users."" said Cui Baoqiu, Xiaomi Vice President and Chairman of Xiaomi Security and Privacy Committee.
David Mudd, BSI Global Digital and Connected Product Certification Director, said, ""Connected devices can bring huge benefits to society, but it is imperative that their function and security can be trusted throughout the required device life. By achieving the BSI Kitemark™ for IoT Devices for its product and having its systems regularly and independently tested and monitored, Xiaomi is demonstrating to consumers their commitment to safeguarding information. Congratulations to the team at Xiaomi for this achievement.""
The BSI IoT Kitemark™ is a product and service quality certification owned and operated by BSI. It conducts technical testing and security audits for IoT systems, giving consumers reassurance and confidence of secure and trust-worthy IoT devices under the highest standards. Obtaining the BSI IoT Kitemark™ Certificate means that Xiaomi products are in compliance with multiple cybersecurity standards, including the ETSI/EN303645 standard issued by European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), as well as the Open Web Application Security Project® (OWASP) Top 10 security requirements.
It is the third time that Xiaomi received this international security accreditation, following Mi 360° Home Security Camera 2K and Xiaomi Home App, which achieved the BSI Kitemark™ Certificates in July 2021.
These are only a small part of the bigger picture of what Xiaomi has achieved on IoT security. In June 2021, Xiaomi published the Xiaomi IoT Privacy White Paper *[2], explaining the security and privacy policies and practices of Xiaomi's IoT products, gaining trust by increasing the transparency. In November of the same year, in The Contemporary Use of Vulnerability Disclosure in IoT (Report 4: November 2021) *[3] published by the Internet of Things Security Foundation (IoTSF), Xiaomi was listed as one of the 21 IoT device suppliers that met the extended threshold test, namely received the highest rating for security vulnerability disclosure policy, which demonstrates Xiaomi's leadership in IoT security.
In the future, Xiaomi will keep improving its IoT security framework, while strengthening its security management and technical testing capabilities to fulfill the responsibility of a global industry leader and let everyone in the world enjoy a better and smarter life through innovative and safe technology.

Twice the cooling capability of conventional VC solutions, mass production aimed for H2 2022
Beijing, CHINA, November 5th, 2021 – Today, Global technology leader Xiaomi unveiled its latest breakthrough in heat dissipation – Loop LiquidCool Technology. Inspired by cooling solutions used in the aerospace industry, Loop LiquidCool Technology utilizes a capillary effect which draws liquid cooling agent to the heat source, vaporizes, and then disperses the heat efficiently towards a cooler area, until the agent condenses and is captured via a unidirectional closed looped channel. Compared to conventional vapor chambers solutions, this new technology has twice the cooling capabilities and ranks as the most efficient smartphone cooling solution. Xiaomi aims to bring Loop LiquidCool Technology to its products in H2 2022.
Loop LiquidCool Technology
This new technology features an annular heat pipe system that is composed of an evaporator, a condenser, a refill chamber, as well as gas and liquid pipes. Placed at heat sources, the evaporator has refrigerant that evaporates to gas when the smartphone is under high workload. The gas and airflow is then diffused to the condenser, where the gas condenses into liquid again. These liquids are absorbed and collected through tiny fibers in the refill chamber—which refills the evaporator—making it a self-sustaining system.

Although this new technology uses the same method as VC liquid cooling, the new form factor makes a significant efficiency difference. As conventional VC systems do not have separate channels for gases and liquids, hot gas and cool liquids mix and obstruct each other while, especially under high workload. The ring-shaped pump features a special gas pipe design, which greatly reduces air passage resistance by 30%. By allowing for a smoother steam flow, the maximum heat transfer capacity is increased by up to 100%.
One-way circulation is key to heat dissipation
To ensure one-way high-efficiency circulation, implementing a Tesla valve structure within the refill chamber is crucial. A Tesla valve is a one-way valve that allow liquid to pass through the evaporator, while blocking gases from moving in the incorrect direction. This allows for a higher efficiency in gas/liquid circulation throughout the system.

On a custom Xiaomi MIX 4, the original vapor chamber was replaced with a new Loop LiquidCool Technology solution. During a 30-minute Genshin Impact gameplay test running 60fps max video settings, this impressive cooling system kept the device below a max temperature of 47.7℃ and the processor was 8.6℃ lower than the standard version.
Thanks to the one-way circulation, gas-liquid separation, and low heat-resistance gas pipes of the Tesla valve, the flexible form factor also makes it possible to adopt and stack Loop LiquidCool Technology into any type of internal design. For example, a square-shaped loop will allow more space for the battery, camera module, and more.

Xiaomi is a good example of a responsible vendor responding to that call and is a good example of a company taking security best practice seriously. Xiaomi has been active in demonstrating its commitments – for example publishing aVulnerability Disclosure Policy since 2019 and being transparent in how its teams adhere to the principle of security at all stages of the product life cycle . We’re proud to have them as members of IoTSF and showing leadership in the market.""

On October 30th, Xiaomi ushered another significant moment in its development of New Retail business model: the 10,000th Xiaomi Store in mainland China was opened in Shenzhen, Guangdong. The store is located amongst one of the most bustling commercial areas in the city, occupying an entirely independent building of 600 square meters, equipped with a large naked eye 3D LED display.
Lei Jun, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Xiaomi congratulated the opening of the 10,000th Xiaomi Store on his Twitter. Lu Weibing, Partner and Senior Vice President of Xiaomi Group, and President of China Region, President of International Department, and General Manager of the Redmi brand, said: ""The opening of the 10,000th Xiaomi Store marked a new milestone-like breakthrough of the New Retail of Xiaomi."" Lu Weibing addressed that no matter how the company's business goes, the initial vision of Xiaomi New Retail will always remain the same: letting every Xiaomi Fan have a Xiaomi Store close to homes, and allowing everyone to experience and purchase amazing Xiaomi products conveniently with reasonable prices.
The 10,000th Xiaomi Store adopts the brand-new ""Xiaomi Store 4.0"" concept, with a minimalist style and futuristic technology feeling. This also serves as a multi-function store that provides both sales and services. Customers can have hands-on experience and purchase almost all Xiaomi products, including the flagship smartphones, such as Xiaomi MIX FOLD and Xiaomi 11 series, the newly released Redmi Note 11 series products, and many AIoT products. At the store, all customers are allowed to return the purchased products for up to 7 days after purchase with no strings attached, and 15-day free replacement (including online purchases), plus one-year free in-store maintenance during the warranty period. Xiaomi also warrants repairing and other quality services of the products sent by customers at any service stores in Mainland China. In addition, the store also provides the options of ordering online and picking up items at the store, while having access to other related services on a regular basis.
In November 2020, Xiaomi announced a new goal: to enable every Xiaomi Fan to have a Xiaomi Store nearby in the future. As a result, Xiaomi New Retail has entered a stage of rapid expansion and is setting a record of 27 new Xiaomi Stores opened per day in Mainland China. In the past 12 months, a total of nearly 8,000 Xiaomi Stores have opened.
New Retail is one of the three pillars of Xiaomi's ""Triathlon"" business model, along with smart hardware and Internet service. At the beginning of Xiaomi's foundation, Lei Jun proposed that the Internet model could be implemented in retail to achieve higher efficiency, which could reduce the cost of sales and operation, therefore improving user experience. It has been proven that Xiaomi Stores have grown because customers trust them to provide products and services in an efficient and friendly way. Currently, Xiaomi Store is expanding rapidly not only within Mainland China but also in all markets around the world and receiving warm welcomes from customers. This not only increases more access for its consumers around the world to experience Xiaomi products directly but also shows Xiaomi's relentless efforts in business advancement.
Lu Weibing said, ""We believe that everyone has the right for a better quality of life through innovative technology, simply because the gap to a high quality of life should not be out of reach.""

03/09/2021393 Views
Beijing, CHINA, September 3, 2021 – This week, Xiaomi premiered their first-ever film festival consisting of short films shot entirely on Xiaomi smartphones, each film giving a unique perspective of life in ""The New Normal"" following the global pandemic. A variety of filmmakers from all over the world were invited to showcase their short films at the inaugural film festival, furthering Xiaomi Studios' initiative of providing a global platform to creatives to help inspire creativity at all levels.
The festival showcases works from filmmakers including mega tech influencer Arun Maini aka Mrwhosetheboss, Xiaomi Creators Vincenzo De Caro and Eduardo Ohara, Spanish student Oscar Villarroya from the TAI Escuela Universitaria de Artes Film, as well as the renowned Italian and Thai directors Gabriele Muccino and Nattawut Poonpiriya. A cornerstone of the festival is a contribution by Academy Award winning director Chris Overton, an English filmmaker. The short film “Leader” examines the question of creativity in an ever-changing world.
 Despite their unique approaches to answering this question of “The New Normal”, the unifying message is that they aim to face this uncertain yet exciting time with optimism and hope that ""something wonderful is about to happen"". 
 Introductory Short Film: ""One Billion View"" by Arun Maini aka Mrwhosetheboss
Xiaomi partnered with mega tech influencer Arun Maini, also known as Mrwhosetheboss. Arun produced and starred in the film ""One Billion Views"", which shares his ten-year journey towards becoming a major tech influencer and his milestone moment of reaching over a billion views. Arun talks about his journey from humble beginnings to where he finds himself now—creating content in a world deeply impacted by the pandemic. In this new world, advances in smartphone technology have enabled any user to create and share content, despite the challenges we now face.
Premiere Film: ""Leader"" by Academy Award winning director, Chris Overton
 In ""Leader"", Overton explores ""The New Normal"" through the eyes of the protagonist Donnie, an artist who lives on a remote beach collecting washed up plastic and making sculptures in his makeshift workshop. Like many others around the globe, his life is then suddenly interrupted when the garbage suddenly stops washing ashore and masked strangers begin visiting him—causing him to inspire a ""New Normal"" in those around as the sea salvage returns.
 Student Film: Twenty Summers by Oscar Villarroya
 Xiaomi Studios set out to provide a global platform for upcoming filmmakers to share their vision of ""The New Normal"", particularly for students heavily affected by the pandemic. As a result, Xiaomi Film Festival partnered with the prestigious Spanish film school TAI Escuela Universitaria de Artes.
 This unique partnership enabled student Oscar Villarroya to create a film about the anxieties that students like him face as they come to grips with the repercussions of the pandemic and the transition to ""The New Normal"". His film ""Twenty Summers"" follows three best friends on one last road trip around the Spanish countryside before they go their separate ways, but one of them is not ready to face ""The New Normal"" just yet.
 Regional Showcase Films by Xiaomi Creators and Renowned Directors
 As part of its aim to provide a global filmmaker platform, Xiaomi Film Festival has been actively working with renowned directors and Xiaomi Creators in different regions to present the emergence of smartphones as ""The New Normal"" of filmmaking for both upcoming and established directors around the world.
""The Reels Deal"" from acclaimed filmmaker Nattawut Poonpiriya.
Break the fourth wall together with us in ""Living in a Movie"" produced by Xiaomi Italy and Italian director Muccino Gabriele.
""Renaissance"" from Xiaomi Creator Vincenzo De Caro in Italy redefines work from home life

 All of the short films included in the festival are scheduled to premiere online and the festival will culminate in an offline event with the TAI Escuela Universitaria de Artes in Madrid, Spain. Student director Oscar Villarroya is expected to attend.
 Steven Senshan, Head of Xiaomi Studios comments, ""Xiaomi hopes with the Xiaomi Film Festival, filmmakers from around the world can continue to come together and be inspired by the content that can be created with the phone in your pocket. In the years to come, Xiaomi Studios look to continue to expand on the message of the inaugural film festival by creating more opportunities for excellent filmmakers worldwide to participate, as well as to hold possible offline events in the future.""

Award-winning Haptic Feature Enables the Visually Impaired to Experience the UI
Beijing, CHINA, May 20, 2021 – Today is the Global Availability Awareness Day, where Xiaomi welcomed a group of special guests at the Xiaomi Science and Technology Park - Mi Fans with disabilities and Speech Recognition Assistants for Mi AI Speakers. They were invited to the headquarters of Xiaomi to visit Mi Home and R&D laboratories, as well as participate in the Co-creation Session and ""Touch the Beauty"" Accessibility Sharing Session.

During the visit, team members from MIUI, AI, Services, loT and other departments engaged with Mi Fans with disabilities and understood their needs and suggestions, where they shared some approaches to enhance accessibility after a lively discussion.
Cao Yu, one of the visually impaired Mi Fans, said that the TalkBack on Xiaomi smartphones had brought great improvements to his life. ""I can use applications such as WeChat, food delivery and map without any trouble now. It is unimaginable without the accessibility features of my Xiaomi phone."" Cao Yu also shared his hopes that the accessibility features on Xiaomi smartphone would become more systematic and more unified in operation details in the future.
""We held this event because we want our team members of Department of Product Design and Department of R&D to communicate with our users with disabilities face to face and to feel what they really need. Only in this way can we truly have the mentality of accessibility and offer better services to our users with disabilities. Our dream is very simple: We want everyone in the world to enjoy a better life with technologies, no one should be forgotten in this journey. "" Said Li Weixing, Vice President of Technology Committee, Xiaomi Corporation.

Cao Yu is sharing his thoughts on accessibility features on Xiaomi smartphones
Accessibility is one of the key areas that Xiaomi has been focusing on since its early stage of establishment. As a leader in the field of information accessibility in China, Xiaomi has developed many accessibility features since 2013 based on the strategy set by the accessibility group, feedback from Mi Fans and the support from various departments. For example, a feature called the ""Xiaomi Wensheng"" (which means ""Xiaomi hears the sound"" in Chinese) can help users by converting voice to text in real-time. Xiaomi has also developed voice control and hand gesture features for users with physical disabilities, which enable them to control smart devices remotely with Mi AI Speakers or Mi Home App. Besides, the Haptic feature enables the visually impaired users to identify different information with vibration, which won the iF Design Award this year and embodies the innovation of technology in the detail.

Liu Qing, who works in the team of accessibility features in Xiaomi said, ""We make friends with users and have established a feedback group for users with disabilities to gauge their comments in time. Concurrently, we present updated accessibility features for users through this group. Xiaomi keeps zero-distance with users with disabilities to ensure products truly meet their needs. Many accessibility features are also gradually developed through on-going communication with users, such as Xiaomi Wensheng and Haptic feature. Xiaomi will also improve the accessibility features systematically in the future.""
In overseas markets, Xiaomi has also cooperated with Google to fully support Google's accessibility services on smartphones. Although not all the accessibility features are available for overseas markets at the moment, Xiaomi is determined to bring them to users all around the world in the future.

At the ""Touch the Beauty"" Accessibility Sharing Session, representatives from the visually impaired group Cai Cong and Fu Gaoshan demonstrated the VoiceOver feature and shared the employment status of people with disabilities respectively. Mr. Fu also highlighted the AI Speaker Voice Labeller Project where Xiaomi has created employment opportunities by collaborating with Qualcomm. Tailor-made accessibility software solutions are also provided at work. As of today, 42 people with disabilities have worked to develop the AI Speaker Voice Labeller Project for three years. 
Chen Xiaowen, a visually impaired team member working on the Project, has broken the stereotype of people with disabilities and expressed the importance of employment for the disabled. ""I have once been denied and refused because of my visual impairment when I tried to find a job. In fact, we could also do a good job as long as we have good accessibility. At my current position, I mainly take charge of labelling users' voices in order to 'teach' AI to understand users' instructions. This opportunity gives me a great sense of worth and belonging, and it has empowered me to pursue a better life.""

Technology equality has been one of the priorities of Xiaomi since it was established 11 years ago. Xiaomi has been working on accessibility features for over eight years.
While it is getting more traction in overseas markets recently, Xiaomi also strives to improve the globalization of accessibility features, especially features on MIUI. MIUI has always been compatible with Google's accessibility features at a systematic level and always aligns with the system updates in suggested time. For example, all Xiaomi system apps are compatible with Google TalkBack. During the development of MIUI, Xiaomi adds description tags to each app so that TalkBack can read them correctly. Overseas users can give feedback to Xiaomi if they have any suggestions or questions about these tags and Xiaomi will modify them through localization. Other advice on accessibility is welcomed as well. By cooperating with Google, Xiaomi will continuously enhance its accessibility features.
