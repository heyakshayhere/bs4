ACV C4\/UAS engineering, integration, and fabrication is taking place at BAE Systems locations in Stafford, Virginia; San Jose, California; Sterling Heights, Michigan; and York, Pennsylvania.","16":"Connecting interoperable sources to support data fusion, minimize disruptions, and provide curated data for mission needsBAE Systems will develop the mission data framework for Space Systems Command\u2019s Enterprise Management and Control (EM&C) system. Under the prototype contract, BAE Systems will create an integrated data management environment, connecting interoperable sources to support fusion and discovery of data, minimize disruptions, deliver near real-time status of assets, and provide curated data for mission needs.  During a year-long development period, BAE Systems will perform four demonstrations. The demonstrations will show improved situational awareness for global satellite communications, or SATCOM, and underscore how the framework allows warfighters to rapidly respond to end users in contested, degraded, and operationally challenged environments.  \u201cOur team is ready to provide the flexible data architecture and foundation required to build a resilient, responsive, and integrated SATCOM data environment,\u201d said Ron Zuccaro, director of Resilient Ground Systems at BAE Systems. \u201cOur cyber-resilient ground systems automate decision-making and integrate intelligence data from disparate sources.\u201d  BAE Systems\u2019 cloud computing suite integrates data sources and applications into a platform in which information flows through data services that act as the working memory of the EM&C system. This core data framework connects previously disparate data sources for mission operators and accelerates the ability for future mission-critical applications to be developed.  The Space Systems Command mission is to provide real-time global access to resilient and sustainable SATCOM capabilities for joint operations warfighters. EM&C enables resilient, uninterrupted satellite communications with the ability to rapidly plan, allocate, monitor, detect, locate, assess, and resolve issues to improve situational awareness and overall mission effectiveness.  Ground processing is a critical component of the overall space landscape, and combined with on-board processing capabilities, BAE Systems\u2019 technology makes missions more effective. The company\u2019s products increase the ability for on-orbit, real-time interaction and decision-making.","17":"BAE Systems has received a $89.4 million contract from the U.S. Navy to perform major modernization work aboard the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Mustin (DDG 89).The value of the competitively awarded contract could reach $95.2 million if all options are exercised.  Under the depot maintenance period (DMP) availability contract awarded, BAE Systems San Diego Ship Repair will dry-dock the ship, perform underwater hull preservation work, recondition the engineering spaces, upgrade its command and control equipment, and refurbish the crew\u2019s living spaces. The DMP work is expected to begin in May 2022 and be completed in November 2023. The company expects to dry-dock the ship at the San Diego Naval Base and then complete the remaining work at its Barrio Logan facility.  \u201cA depot maintenance availability is a significant project for upgrading the capability of Aegis destroyers,\u201d said David M. Thomas, Jr., BAE Systems San Diego Ship Repair\u2019s vice president and general manager. \u201cOur ship repair team has the critical know-how for repairing DDGs from our prior work. The DMP availability we\u2019ll perform on the USS Mustin will usher the ship into a higher phase of fleet readiness.\u201d    BAE Systems\u2019 San Diego shipyard is completing similar work aboard the guided missile destroyer USS Preble (DDG 88) and has previously completed a DMP availability aboard USS Shoup (DDG 86).  USS Mustin is the 39th ship in the Arleigh Burke class and was commissioned in July 2003. The ship is named in honor of the Mustin family who has more than a century of service in the U.S. Navy. One other U.S. Navy combatant has carried the family name, USS Mustin (DD 413).  BAE Systems is a leading provider of ship repair, maintenance, modernization, conversion, and overhaul services for the Navy, other government agencies, and select commercial customers. The company operates three full-service shipyards in California, Florida, and Virginia, and offers a highly skilled, experienced workforce; seven dry-docks and railways; and significant pier space and ship support services. The company\u2019s San Diego shipyard has approximately 1,100 employees and works with the Navy and several subcontractor companies to accomplish its ship sustainment work.","18":"BAE Systems has received a $125.5 million contract from the U.S. Navy to drydock and provide maintenance service aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Essex (LHD 2).The ship recently completed a seven-month deployment to the Western Pacific.  BAE Systems\u2019 San Diego shipyard will begin working aboard the 844-foot-long USS Essex in June. Under the docking selected restricted availability (DSRA) contract awarded, BAE Systems will perform hull, tank, and mechanical work; repair internal and exterior decks; and refurbish habitability spaces for the ship\u2019s crew and embarked U.S. Marine Corps troops. Work on the ship is expected to be completed in September 2023. The contract includes options that, if exercised, would bring the cumulative value to $148.2 million.  \u201cUSS Essex recently returned to San Diego following an extended overseas deployment,\u201d said David M. Thomas, Jr., vice president and general manager of BAE Systems San Diego Ship Repair. \u201cI look forward to the BAE Systems-Navy team delivering upon our commitment to restore Essex\u2019s material condition and prepare it for future deployments.\u201d  USS Essex is the fifth U.S. ship named after Essex County, Mass. The ship was commissioned in October 1992 and is homeported in San Diego.  BAE Systems\u2019 San Diego shipyard is currently completing a 22-month DSRA aboard USS Boxer (LHD 4), which is in the same ship class as Essex.  BAE Systems is a leading provider of ship repair, maintenance, modernization, conversion, and overhaul services for the Navy, other government agencies, and select commercial customers. The company operates three full-service shipyards in California, Florida, and Virginia, and offers a highly skilled, experienced workforce, seven drydocks and railways, significant pier space and ship support services.

The deal \u2013 facilitated by the U.S. Army \u2013 is for the production and delivery of CMWS for a fleet of Apache helicopters.  The CMWS alerts crews to incoming hostile fire and missile threats, automatically coordinates and cues countermeasures, and enables data recording capabilities for post-mission analysis. The fleet will leverage BAE Systems\u2019 new Gen3X Electronic Control Unit with updated components which provide increased processing capabilities and longer term sustainability.  \u201cOur Common Missile Warning System is a tried-and-true, electronic warfare system that protects aircraft and their crews in the most complex battlespaces,\u201d said Chris Austin, director of Threat Detection Solutions at BAE Systems. \u201cWe are honored to have been selected to provide this critical capability.\u201d  Deployed across the U.S. Army\u2019s rotary and fixed-wing fleet, as well as aircraft of 17 allied countries, more than 3,000 CMWS units have been installed on over 40 different platforms since 2005. The CMWS has logged approximately 4 million combat theater flight hours, saving dozens of aircraft and hundreds of lives in an ever-changing threat
