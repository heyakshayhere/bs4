16 December 2021,"Zydus receives Orphan Drug Designation from US FDA for ZY-19489, a novel compound to treat malaria","Zydus receives Orphan Drug Designation from US FDA for            ZY-19489, a novel compound to treat malaria     ZY19489 is a novel anti-malarial compound active against all current clinical strains of      P. falciparum and P. vivax, including drug resistant strains.     The Orphan Drug Designation provides up to seven years of marketing exclusivity in the USA     According to the US CDC, about 2,000 cases of malaria are diagnosed in the United States each      year     The vast majority of cases in the United States are found in travellers returning from countries      where malaria transmission occurs    Ahmedabad, India, December 16, 2021    Zydus Cadila, a research-driven, global healthcare provider, today announced that its antimalarial  compound ZY19489 (MMV253), currently in development together with Medicines for Malaria  Venture (MMV), a leading product development partnership (PDP) in antimalarial drug research, has  received Orphan Drug Designation from the USFDA.  Orphan drug designation provides eligibility for certain development incentives, including tax credits  for qualified clinical testing, prescription drug user fee exemptions and seven-year marketing  exclusivity upon FDA approval.  The Phase I study of ZY19489 has demonstrated long half-life and potential for a single-dose cure for  malaria [Reg’n Number ACTRN12619000127101]. In a separate malaria challenge trial, potent  antimalarial activity has been demonstrated following single-dose oral administration of  ZY19489 [Reg’n Number ACTRN12619001215112].  Speaking on the development, Pankaj R. Patel, Chairman, Zydus Group said, “As a global community  facing threats from rapidly mutating malaria strains and the rise in artemisinin resistance cases, we have  to be prepared with novel therapeutic drugs. ZY-19489 is a potential single dose radical cure for P.  falciparum and P. vivax malaria which is a major global health risk today.""  “ZY19489 is a potent, first in class molecule, originally discovered and elaborated in India” said Dr.  Timothy Wells, Chief Scientific Officer, MMV. “It has tremendous potential as part of a new generation  of treatments and is fully active against drug resistant strains of malaria which are increasingly a  concern.”  Artemisinin resistance is seen as a mounting challenge to the global fight against malaria. ZY19489 is  being developed to provide an effective alternative to the current front-line antimalarial drugs for the  treatment of P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria, as artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are  under threat of resistance.  As per the World Malaria Report 2021, there were an estimated 241 million cases of malaria worldwide  and the estimated number of malaria deaths stood at 627,000 in 2020. A major health concern, it is  estimated that a child dies from malaria every minute. About 96% of malaria deaths globally were in  29 countries. India accounted for about 82% of all malaria deaths in the WHO South-East Asia Region.  About Zydus  Zydus Cadila is an innovative, global pharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, manufactures  and markets a broad range of healthcare therapies, including small molecule drugs, biologic therapeutics  and vaccines.

13 December 2021,"Zydus to begin Phase II (a) clinical trial of ZYIL1, a novel oral NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor in patients with CryopyrinAssociated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS) in Australia","Zydus to begin Phase II (a) clinical trial of ZYIL1, a novel oral           NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor in patients with Cryopyrin-              Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS) in Australia          CAPS is a rare life-long auto-inflammatory condition, caused by NLRP3 activating           mutations and is classified under orphan diseases.  Ahmedabad, India, 13th December, 2021  Zydus, a leading discovery-based, global pharmaceutical company announced today that it has received  permission to initiate the Phase II (a) clinical study of its NLRP3 inhibitor “ZYIL1” in patients with  Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS) in Australia. Phase II (a) clinical trial in Australia  will study the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in patients with Cryopyrin-  Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS).  Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS) is caused by NLRP3 activating mutations that cause  activation of the cryopyrin inflammasome and release of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β.  Selective inhibition of NLRP3 could be beneficial, as NLRP3 inflammasomes are primarily involved  in the inflammation process in these patients.  CAPS is a rare life-long auto-inflammatory condition, and is classified under orphan diseases. The  chronic inflammation due to IL-1beta release in CAPS patients leads to urticaria-like rash, fever,  arthralgia, and increased risk of amyloidosis. CAPS patients also experience multiple neurological  complications like sensorineural hearing loss, migraine, headache, aseptic meningitis and myalgia.  Bone deformities and neurological impairment have been reported in Neonatal Onset Multisystem  Inflammatory Disease (NOMID), the most severe form of CAPS.  Mr. Pankaj R. Patel, Chairman, Cadila Healthcare Ltd. said, “The Cryopyrin Associated Periodic  Syndromes (CAPS) patient community has very limited treatment options and there is a huge unmet  medical need. We are committed to develop novel therapies, and ZYIL1 has potential to treat several  autoimmune diseases.”  ZYIL1 is a novel oral small molecule NLRP3 inhibitor. Studies have demonstrated that ZYIL1 has high  binding affinity in human whole blood, and can selectively supress inflammation caused by the NLRP3  inflammasome. In non-clinical species including mice, rats and non-human primates, ZYIL1 has  demonstrated brain penetration. The efficacy of ZYIL1 has been established in a number of validated  pre-clinical models of Neuroinflammation, Parkinson’s Disease, Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD),  Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Sepsis and acute lung injury models of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome  (ARDS). The candidate, ZYIL1, has an acceptable ADME profile, with good safety margin.  ZYIL1 was found to be safe and well-tolerated in Phase I trials [NCT04731324]. In the second Phase I  trial, Multiple-dose studies of ZYIL1 was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability,  pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) following repeated dosing for 14 days in healthy  subjects [NCT04972188]. ZYIL1 showed rapid oral absorption and steady state was achieved at 48h.  Inhibition of IL-1beta biomarker in Phase I trial demonstrated proof-of-biology.  About Zydus  Zydus Cadila is an innovative, global pharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, manufactures  and markets a broad range of healthcare therapies, including small molecule drugs, biologic therapeutics  and vaccines.

Chronic Kidney Disease is a serious progressive medical condition which is a global unmet healthcare  need involving gradual loss of functioning of kidneys eventually leading to kidney failure. It has been  reported that 114 million people in India, 132 million people in China, 38 million people in the United  States, 21 million patients in Japan and 41 million people in Western Europe are estimated to be living  with Chronic Kidney Disease (Lancet 2020; 395: 709–33).  The NDA for Desidustat is based on positive data from the DREAM-ND and DREAM-D Phase 3 trials  in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Not on Dialysis and on Dialysis.           The DREAM-ND Phase III trial of 588 CKD patients not-on-dialysis compared Desidustat          versus Darbepoietin alpha injection [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04012957]. In the          Desidustat group, mean Hb increased and reached the predefined target of 10.0–12.0 g/dl in          patients and was maintained within the target range for 24 weeks. The study demonstrated the          noninferiority of Desidustat compared to Darbepoetin in the treatment of anemia in patients          with CKD who were not on dialysis.         The DREAM-D Phase III trial of 392 CKD patients on Dialysis compared Desidustat tablet          versus Epoetin alfa injection [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04215120]. In the Desidustat          group, mean Hb increased and reached the predefined target of 10.0–12.0 g/dl in patients and          was maintained within the target range for 24 weeks. The study demonstrated the noninferiority          of Desidustat compared to Epoetin in the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD who were          on dialysis.  Desidustat met its primary efficacy endpoint in both Phase 3 trials, DREAM-ND and DREAM-D,  conducted in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients on Dialysis and Not on Dialysis. The data will  be presented at upcoming scientific meetings and published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  “We are excited by this important milestone and thankful to all the patients, investigators, regulators  and scientists, who led the discovery and development of Desidustat over the last decade. Desidustat  has the potential to provide an oral, safer alternative to currently available injectable erythropoietin-  stimulating agents (ESAs), by additionally reducing hepcidin, reducing inflammation, and better iron  mobilisation. With patient-centricity at the core of all that we do, we have been looking at innovative  approaches to improving the quality of life of patients and bridging unmet needs and with Desidustat  we have taken yet another step in this direction. ” said, Mr. Pankaj R. Patel, Chairman, Cadila  Healthcare Ltd.  Desidustat had previously met its primary endpoints in the Phase II clinical studies and showed good  safety profile, endogenous production of erythropoietin, downregulation of hepcidin, improved iron  mobilization in CKD patients. The Phase I trials were earlier completed in Australia. Desidustat is also  under clinical trials for Cancer Chemotherapy Induced Anemia (CIA) [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:  NCT04667533].

Ahmedabad, India, October 22, 2021  Zydus, a leading discovery based, global pharmaceutical company today announced that it has  randomised the First patient into the Phase 2(b) Prospective, Multi-centre, Randomized,  Double-blind, Placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Saroglitazar  Magnesium in subjects with Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis and Fibrosis. Zydus had earlier  received permission from the USFDA [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05011305].  The EVIDENCES-XTM liver biopsy driven Phase 2(b) trial will be led by Prof. Naga Chalasani,  M.D., Interim Chair, Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine and  Prof. Arun J. Sanyal, M.D., Division of Gastroenterology, Virginia Commonwealth University  as co-Principal Investigators. The EVIDENCES-XTM trial will randomise 240 subjects in a  1:1:1 ratio to Saroglitazar 2 mg, Saroglitazar 4 mg or Placebo and study the primary endpoint  “Resolution of steatohepatitis with no worsening of fibrosis” over a period of 76 weeks. The  secondary end-points will include improvement in liver fibrosis with no increase in NAS for  ballooning, inflammation or steatosis, 2 points improvement in NAS, Improvement in steatosis,  ballooning, inflammation and fibrosis from liver biopsy, Histological score changes in  steatosis, ballooning, inflammation and fibrosis.  Incidences of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) have been rising exponentially  worldwide and are associated with co-morbidities including obesity, diabetes, hypertension and  metabolic disorders. Experts estimate that about 25% of adults have NAFLD worldwide (K  Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: global impact and clinical consequences, Younossi et al., Endocr  Connect. 2021 Oct 7;10(10):R240-R247. doi: 10.1530/EC-21-0048.). NASH is a progressive  form of NAFLD and is characterised by histologic evidence of hepatic steatosis, lobular  inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning with or without pericellular fibrosis, and/or Mallory-  Denk bodies, which can progress to liver cirrhosis, liver cancer and need for liver transplant or  death. Experts estimate about 5 – 20 % of adults worldwide have NASH placing significant  clinical, economical, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) burden for treating this liver  disease (Source: Cost of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in Europe and the USA: The GAIN  study. Jamie O-Hare et. al., JHEP Reports 2020 vol. 2 j 100142). Analysts estimate the global  market for Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) treatment will reach $27 billion in 2029  (Source: Globaldata).  Speaking on the new development, Chairman of Cadila Healthcare Ltd., Mr. Pankaj R. Patel  said, “As there is currently no drug approved for the treatment of NASH in the USA, this life  threatening liver disease is a high unmet medical need. We are committed to develop novel  therapeutics for patients living with liver diseases and fibrosis. We stand encouraged that the  findings from the earlier EVIDENCES-IV Phase 2 clinical study have been published as  original article by Samer et al along with the editorial by Prof. Sven Francque, M.A. a leading  hepatologist from Belgium in the October edition of Hepatology, the Journal of American  Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)”.  NASH is a chronic liver disease characterised by fat accumulation and inflammation in the  liver, which can progress to liver cirrhosis, need for liver transplant or death. Saroglitazar Mg  is an investigational compound in the USA, and is yet to be approved by the U.S. Food & Drug  Administration (USFDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA). The USFDA has granted  ‘Orphan Drug Designation’ and ‘Fast Track Designation’ to Saroglitazar Mg for PBC. The  European Medicines Agency (EMA) has designated ""Saroglitazar magnesium"" with Orphan  status for Treatment of Primary Biliary Cholangitis.

(“Cyprium”), a  Fortress Biotech, Inc. (Nasdaq: FBIO) (“Fortress”) partner company, with support from its licensing  partner Sentynl Therapeutics, Inc. (“Sentynl”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Cadila Healthcare Limited  (“Zydus”), today announced positive results from an efficacy and safety analysis of data integrated from  two completed pivotal studies in patients with Menkes disease treated with CUTX-101, copper  histidinate (CuHis). In both pre-specified primary and secondary efficacy analyses, treatment with CUTX-  101 demonstrated a significantly greater median overall survival (OS) compared to untreated historical  control patients. These data will be presented as a virtual poster at the 2021 American Academy of  Pediatrics National Conference & Exhibition. More information on the poster is listed below:    Virtual Poster Title: Copper Histidinate Treatment for Menkes Disease (Kinky Hair Syndrome)  Presentation Date: Friday, October 08, 2021  Session: (VH1410) Section on Advances in Therapeutics and Technology Program  Authors: Stephen G. Kaler, M.D., M.P.H., Shama Munim, M.S., Michael Chen, Ph.D., Robert Niecestro,  Ph.D., Lung S. Yam, M.D., Ph.D.    “There is a significant unmet need for an approved treatment for patients with Menkes disease. These  positive data demonstrate the potential of CUTX-101 to be an effective therapy for patients with this  devastating disease. We look forward to working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to  begin our rolling submission of a new drug application (“NDA”) for CUTX-101 in the fourth quarter of this  year,” said Lung S. Yam, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Cyprium.    In two completed open-label, single-arm, single-site studies, 129 patients with Menkes disease were  treated with CUTX-101 (1450 mcg CUTX-101, equivalent to 250 mcg elemental copper) administered  subcutaneously twice daily until 12 months of age, and once daily thereafter, for a total duration of up  to three years. Sixty-six patients born after 1999 and with severe loss-of-function ATP7A mutations  from these two studies were combined and categorized into an Early Treatment cohort (CuHis-ET;  treatment initiated within 4 weeks of birth, corrected for prematurity, n=31) and a Late Treatment  cohort (CuHis-LT; treatment initiated after 4 weeks of birth, n=35). A historical control cohort of 18  Menkes disease patients who had not been treated with CUTX-101 were enrolled (including 18 in  historical control-early treatment cohort (HC-ET); 17 of whom were also included in historical control-  late treatment (HC-LT)). Efficacy of CUTX-101 was assessed by comparing CuHis-ET to untreated HC-ET,  and CuHis-LT to untreated HC-LT, using OS as the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints,  respectively.  The primary efficacy endpoint comparing CuHis-ET to HC-ET and the secondary efficacy endpoint  comparing CuHis-LT to HC-LT were both met. Overall, a 79% reduction in risk of death was observed in  CuHis-ET patients compared with HC-ET patients and median OS was 177.1 and 16.1 months,  respectively with a hazard ratio (HR) of (95% CI) = 0.208 (0.094, 0.463) p<0.0001. A 75% reduction in the  risk of death was also observed in CuHis-LT patients compared with HC-LT subjects and median OS was  62.4 and 17.6 months, respectively; HR (95% CI) = 0.253 (0.119, 0.537); p<0.0001.    Clinical benefit was greater for patients who were treated within four weeks of birth with CUTX-101,  emphasizing the importance of early identification, including newborn screening and prompt initiation  of treatment. A newborn screening test for Menkes disease is currently in development.    CUTX-101 was shown to be well tolerated. In CuHis-ET and CuHis-LT cohorts, the most common  treatment emergent adverse events were pneumonia (30.3%), seizures (21.2%), dehydration (18.2%),  failure to thrive (16.7%), and respiratory distress (15.2%) and no patient discontinued due to an adverse  event considered related to treatment.    Stephen G. Kaler, M.D., M.P.H., a physician-scientist in the Center for Gene Therapy in the Abigail Wexner  Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, is Principal Investigator of the clinical studies and is  also a professor of Pediatrics and Genetics at The Ohio State University College of Medicine.    “We are grateful to the patients and their families who have participated in the clinical studies over the  years. We would also like to thank Dr. Kaler for his ongoing efforts and dedication to improving  therapies for this devastating pediatric disease. We commend the Cyprium team who has worked  diligently to advance the CUTX-101 program and will remain steadfast and focused on bringing this  therapy to patients,” said Dr. Yam.    Cyprium has partnered with Sentynl Therapeutics, Inc., a U.S.-based specialty pharmaceutical company  owned by the Zydus Group, to bring CUTX-101 to market. Cyprium will retain development responsibility  of CUTX-101 through approval of the NDA by the FDA, and Sentynl will be responsible for  commercialization of CUTX-101 as well as progressing newborn screening activities.    “We are encouraged by the clinical data presented at the 2021 American Academy of Pediatrics National  Conference & Exhibition and are excited to continue to support Cyprium’s efforts to advance CUTX-101  through NDA approval as we parallel significant efforts in Disease Awareness education and Newborn  Screening. These developments support the group’s ongoing endeavor to address unmet healthcare  needs,” said Matthew Heck, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sentynl.    About Menkes Disease  Menkes disease is a rare X-linked recessive pediatric disease caused by gene mutations of copper  transporter ATP7A. The minimum birth prevalence for Menkes disease is believed to be 1 in 34,810 live  male births, and potentially as high as 1 in 8,664 live male births, based on recent genome-based  ascertainment (Kaler SG, Ferreira CR, Yam LS. Estimated birth prevalence of Menkes disease and ATP7A-  related disorders based on the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). Molecular Genetics and  Metabolism Reports 2020 June 5;24:100602). The condition is characterized by distinctive clinical  features, including sparse and depigmented hair (“kinky hair”), connective tissue problems, and severe  neurological symptoms such as seizures, hypotonia, failure to thrive, and neurodevelopmental delays.  Mortality is high in untreated Menkes disease, with many patients dying before the age of three years  old. Milder versions of ATP7A mutations are associated with other conditions, including Occipital Horn  Syndrome and ATP7A-related Distal Motor Neuropathy. Currently, there is no FDA-approved treatment  for Menkes disease and its variants.  About CUTX-101 (Copper Histidinate)  CUTX-101 is in clinical development to treat patients with Menkes disease. CUTX-101 is a subcutaneous  injectable formulation of Copper Histidinate manufactured under current good manufacturing practice  (“cGMP”) and physiological pH. In a Phase 1/2 clinical trial conducted by Stephen G. Kaler, M.D., M.P.H.,  at the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), early treatment of patients with Menkes disease with CUTX-  101 led to an improvement in neurodevelopmental outcomes and survival. In August 2020, Cyprium  reported positive topline clinical efficacy results for CUTX-101, demonstrating statistically significant  improvement in overall survival for Menkes disease subjects who received early treatment (ET) with  CUTX-101, compared to an untreated historical control (HC) cohort, with a nearly 80% reduction in the  risk of death. A Cyprium-sponsored expanded access protocol for patients with Menkes disease is  ongoing at multiple U.S. medical centers.    About Cyprium Therapeutics  Cyprium Therapeutics, Inc. (“Cyprium”) is focused on the development of novel therapies for the  treatment of Menkes disease and related copper metabolism disorders. In March 2017, Cyprium  entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (“CRADA”) with the Eunice Kennedy  Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (“NICHD”), part of the NIH, to  advance the clinical development of CUTX-101 (Copper Histidinate injection) for the treatment of  Menkes disease. In addition, Cyprium and NICHD entered into a worldwide, exclusive license agreement  to develop and commercialize adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy, called AAV-ATP7A, to  deliver working copies of the copper transporter that is defective in patients with Menkes disease, and  to be used in combination with CUTX-101. CUTX-101 was granted FDA Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track  and Rare Pediatric Disease Designations, and both CUTX-101 and AAV-ATP7A have received FDA Orphan  Drug Designation previously. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency previously granted Orphan  Drug Designation to CUTX-101. Cyprium was founded by Fortress Biotech, Inc. (Nasdaq: FBIO) and is  based in New York City.

20 August 2021,Zydus Receives EUA from DCGI for ZyCoV-D,"Zydus receives EUA from DCGI for ZyCoV-D, the only needle-free                    COVID vaccine in the world     •   World’s first Plasmid DNA Vaccine for COVID-19, ZyCoV-D will be administered in three         doses.     •   Apart from adults, for the first time adolescents in the age group of 12-18 years will take the         vaccine shot in India.     •   Safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of the vaccine is well established.     •   Company begins stockpiling of the vaccine.      Ahmedabad, August 20, 2021,  Zydus Cadila today announced that the company has received the Emergency Use  Authorization (EUA) from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) for ZyCoV-D the  world’s first Plasmid DNA Vaccine for COVID-19. ZyCoV-D is a three dose vaccine which  will be administered first on day zero, day 28th and then on the 56th day. With this approval,  India now has its first COVID-19 vaccine for the adolescents in the 12-18 age group, besides  the adult population. ZyCoV-D, is a needle-free vaccine administered using The PharmaJet® a  needle free applicator, which ensures painless intradermal vaccine delivery.  This is for the first time that a technologically advanced vaccine has been successfully  developed on the Plasmid DNA platform for human use. The platform because of its rapid plug  and play technology can be easily adapted to deal with mutations in the virus, such as those  already occurring. The company plans to manufacture 10-12 crore doses of ZyCoV-D annually.  Speaking on this development, Mr. Pankaj R. Patel, Chairman, Cadila Healthcare Ltd., said  “This is a historic milestone with ZyCoV-D, a product of Indian innovation becoming the  world’s first DNA vaccine being offered for human use and supporting the world’s largest  immunization drive. We are particularly happy that our vaccine will contribute to this fight  against COVID-19 and enable the country to vaccinate a larger population especially in the age  group of 12-18 years. I would like to thank all the researchers, clinical trial investigators,  volunteers and the regulators who have supported this endeavour.”  The company also plans to seek approval for the two dose regimen of the vaccine. The main  advantage of DNA vaccines is their ability to stimulate both the humoral and cellular arms of  the adaptive immune system. They are a valuable form of antigen-specific immunotherapy, as  they are safe, stable and can be easily produced.  Zydus acknowledges the support of National Biopharma Mission, BIRAC, Department of  Biotechnology, Govt of India, National Institute of Virology, Indian Council of Medical  Research and PharmaJet® in the development of ZyCoV-D vaccine.  About ZyCoV-D           ZyCoV-D is a Plasmid DNA vaccine which when administered produces the spike         protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and elicits an immune response mediated by the         cellular and humoral arms of the human immune system, which play a vital role in         protection from disease as well as viral clearance.    Facts about ZyCoV-D       •   ZyCoV-D is an intradermal vaccine, which will be administered in three doses.     •   It will be applied using The PharmaJet® needle free system, Tropis®, which can also         lead to a significant reduction in any kind of side effects.     •   ZyCoV-D is stored at 2-8 degree C but has shown good stability at temperatures of 25         degree C for at least three months. The thermostability of the vaccine will help in easy         transportation and storage of the vaccine and reduce any cold chain breakdown         challenges leading to vaccine wastage.     •   The plasmid DNA platform provides ease of manufacturing with minimal biosafety         requirements (BSL-1).     •   Also being a Plasmid DNA vaccine, ZyCoV-D doesn’t have any problem associated         with vector based immunity.     •   The Plasmid DNA platform also allows generating new constructs quickly to deal with         mutations in the virus, such as those already occurring.     •   The results of the Phase I part of the Phase I/II clinical trial have already been published         in the EClinical Medicine Journal of Lancet.
