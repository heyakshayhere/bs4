This year, Fincantieri will deliver a further four cruise ships to LR Class. 2022 marks the 150-year anniversary of LR in Italy. Since the first LR surveyor in Genoa was appointed in 1872, LR has supported Italy to become a global leader in passenger ship building. Sharing rich maritime heritage, LR and Fincantieri have together achieved numerous notable industry firsts, such as Carnival Destiny, delivered in 1996, the first cruise ship over 100,000 GT and the world's largest cruise ship at that time. Grand Princess was also the largest cruise ship in the world when delivered in 1998. Additionally, LR classed the first dual fuel/LNG ferry ever built in Italy F.A Gauthier, delivered by Fincantieri in 2015.

10 MARCH 2022,CONSTRUCTION KICKS OFF OF THE NEW MSC MIAMI TERMINAL,"It will begin operations by the end of 2023 and will be able to handle 36,000 passengers a day while simultaneously harbouring three latest-generation and low environmental impact vessels. It also provides the possibility of shore-to-ship power solutions. In the light of the project s strategic relevance for Italy s economy and its support for exports, MSC was assured the financing for the operation by Intesa Sanpaolo and CDP. The loan is guaranteed by SACE with the contribution of SIMEST in terms of rate stability and interest subsidies. Geneva-Trieste-Miami, March 10, 2022 The construction of the new MSC Cruises terminal kicked off in Miami today with the laying of the first stone . MSC Cruises is the world s third-ranking cruise line brand owned by the MSC Group, a global leader in the shipping and logistics sector. The construction work, carried out by Fincantieri Infrastructure in what is considered to be the world capital of cruise tourism, will be the largest state-of-the-art terminal in the United States and one of the most important internationally, which will be able to simultaneously harbour three latest-generation and low environmental impact ships such as MSC Cruises future LNG-fuelled ships which are scheduled to become operational in the upcoming months, handling up to 36,000 passengers a day. Pierfrancesco Vago, Executive Chairman di MSC Cruises, stated: This initiative represents a further important step in the long-standing and fruitful collaboration between MSC and Fincantieri. Together with other leading economic players of the ""Italian System"" such as Intesa Sanpaolo, CDP, Sace and Simest, we are partners of a project that honors the Italian know-how and engineering skills in the world, called upon to engage in the American cruise market. It will be the largest and most technologically advanced terminal in the United States, a new benchmark in the sector, as well as one of the most significant investments made in Miami. It will allow our Company to strengthen and further grow in the most important and competitive cruise market in the world . Giuseppe Bono, Chief Executive Officer of Fincantieri, commented: The beginning of works on this big facility is the crowning achievement performed by our Group over the last years. We have been capable of further consolidating our relationship with MSC, based on innovation and constant improvement, and we have at the same time undertaken business initiatives that have enabled us to expand our competences, also with a view to offering our customers cutting-edge products and services. This new futuristic terminal will therefore not only be the expression of the very best that the Made in Italy brand can offer but also of the success of our business strategies . With an iconic design developed by the multi-award-winning international architecture firm Arquitectonica, the new terminal will feature a multi-level four-floor central body and innovative environmentally advanced solutions, including the possibility of a shore-to-ship power supply, thus further reducing emissions from ships at dock. It is scheduled to begin operations by the end of 2023. In addition to offering state-of-the-art passenger service facilities, the new terminal will also be endowed with several office spaces, a multi-level parking for approximately 2,400 vehicles and envisages the construction of a new road connection. Moreover, the project also provides for the construction of two modern and efficient docks, measuring 750 meters in total. A third berth will be built by Miami-Dade County. Lastly, the project includes the construction of related seashore infrastructure, including water and power supply stations. The new cruise facility will cost approximately 350 million euros and represents one of the largest investments recently made in the United States by an Italian-led multinational corporation like the MSC Group, in partnership with Italian centres of excellence as Fincantieri, number one in shipbuilding at global level. Both these corporations are the best qualified ambassadors of the Made in Italy brand in the world. In the light of the project s strategic relevance for Italy s economy and its support for exports, MSC was assured the financing for the operation by Intesa Sanpaolo and CDP. The loan is guaranteed by SACE with the contribution of SIMEST in terms of providing rate stability and interest subsidies. The relationship between MSC and Fincantieri has progressively consolidated over the last decade, with MSC s Cruise Division commissioning up to eight ships from Fincantieri four for the MSC Cruises brand and four for the Explora Journeys brand for a total value of almost 6 billion euros, with a spillover effect on the Italian economy amounting to approximately 27 billion euros. At present, MSC has two options for two additional ships for Explora Journeys and there is the possibility of new orders for both brands. Therefore, the MSC Group is not only one of the main customers of the Italian shipbuilding group but also one of the major investors in Italy, where its direct spending amounts to 3.5 billion euros every year and where it employs nearly 15,000 workers, while being a source of employment for more than 50,000 people.",https://www.fincantieri.com/en/media/press-releases/2022/construction-kicks-off-of-the-new-msc-miami-terminal/,https://www.fincantieri.com/globalassets/common/header/logo_new.png,Fincantieri

27 JANUARY 2022,"INNOVATION: ENEA AND FINCANTIERI TEAM UP FOR ENERGY, ENVIRONMENT, AND CIRCULAR ECONOMY","Rome/Trieste, Jan. 27, 2022 Fincantieri and ENEA signed a memorandum of understanding aimed at identifying areas of common interest and developing a research and innovation program portfolio. The partnership will include different areas, among which the followings stand out: energy efficiency, renewable energy generation systems for the production, transportation and distribution of hydrogen, fuel cells, the circular economy, management and control strategies for Smart Ports and Smart Cities, materials technologies and remediation actions for sustainability in marine and terrestrial environments. In order to step up cooperation, specific working groups will be implemented, and possibilities for personnel exchange, that is ENEA researchers being hosted in Fincantieri while personnel of the Trieste group work in ENEA s Researcher Centres, are also envisaged. Under this agreement ENEA aims to promote a wider spread of scientific knowledge and research, in its competence sectors, while Fincantieri wishes to maintain its role as a global technology leader, by acquiring further knowledge and innovative competence in the industrial fields of its business sectors. This agreement paves the way for a partnership of major significance between research and the business sector; we are teaming up with an international leading group such as Fincantieri, to tackle issues such as sustainability, higher training and education, research and innovation transfer, which are more and more strategic for growth and competitiveness Gilberto Dialuce, ENEA President, stressed. We are really pleased that ENEA was chosen as a partner; we have expertise and qualified facilities to be made available in many fields, from hydrogen technologies to renewable sources, from CO2 capture to robotics and big data, from the circular economy to advanced materials, but also alternative fuels and remediation actions on areas hosting shipbuilding sites, also with a view to mitigation and adaptation to climate change . Giuseppe Bono, CEO of Fincantieri, commented: In recent years, we have allocated an average of 160 million euros for several projects related to process and product innovation with a special focus on decarbonization and digitalization. Indeed, 60% of our R&I spending fuels the development of clean technologies which will play a role in creating increasingly eco-sustainable products and services, oriented towards resource efficiency and biodiversity protection. Hence, this agreement is part of a long-standing strategy, which we are sure will allow us not only to consolidate the success achieved to date, but also to support the future competitiveness of the Group, called to face increasingly complex and demanding global scenarios .",https://www.fincantieri.com/en/media/press-releases/2022/innovation-enea-and-fincantieri-team-up-for-energy-environment-and-circular-economy/,https://www.fincantieri.com/globalassets/common/header/logo_new.png,Fincantieri
17 JANUARY 2022,FINCANTIERI: CORPORATE NURSERY PROGRAMME KICKS OFF,"Trieste, January 17, 2022 Today, in the presence of Prof. Elena Bonetti, the Italian Minister for Equal Opportunities and Family, Fincantieri CEO Giuseppe Bono, the secretaries general of the FIM, FIOM and UILM trade unions Roberto Benaglia, Francesca Re David and Rocco Palombella, respectively, and the Minister signed the agreement for the creation of corporate nurseries to support parenting. The first nursery will be inaugurated in Trieste within the first months of the year in the headquarters of the company s Merchant Ships Division and will be called Fincantesimo . It will be followed by the nursery for the employees of the Monfalcone shipyard, located in the former Albergo Operai building, a symbol of Fincantieri s historic bond with the local community. Works are scheduled to begin between the end of 2022 and early 2023. Implementation of the project will then continue with the gradual activation of the service at the other company sites. Despite the pandemic, Fincantieri has hired more than 1,400 employees over the last three years. Most of these are young people, lowering the average age at the company. The company carried out an in-house survey in 2021 to verify interest in nurseries and received strongly positive feedback that led to development of the project. The company will bear the cost of the service, except for a monthly fee paid by the parents of the children housed in the nursery, based on their ISEE (Equivalent Financial Situation Indicator) bracket. Fincantieri will assess alternative aids for those families finding themselves barred from the admission list, and, if requests for admission are lower than availability, the nurseries will be opened to the local communities to also include the children of employees of the supply chain companies. Elena Bonetti, Minister for Equal Opportunities and Family, commented: Today s signature between Fincantieri and FIM, FIOM and UILM is very reflective of the change of pace the country has decided to adopt by investing in the families, parenting and women s work: a strategic and forward-looking agreement that aims at building company nurseries, contributing to educational services and monitoring goals to ensure their attainment. This choice goes precisely in the direction the government has outlined in these last few months with the investment in its National Recovery and Resilience Plan of 4.6 billion euros in nurseries and infant schools, the introduction in the Budget Law of the LEPs or essential performance levels for nurseries, and the 50 million euros fund for company projects supporting women returning to work after maternity leave. Harmonizing family life and work, assuming the co-responsibility for the education of the younger generations and fostering women s work are crucial challenges for the future that need to be tackled together. Initiatives such as this one, which open shared paths to put the individual viewed as a whole back in the center, are important and make trusting and savoring the future tangible and credible. They are building them to make the whole country grow. Giuseppe Bono, CEO of Fincantieri, stated: Our goal is to foster work-life balance by especially allowing women to be mothers in every moment. During the project definition, we reflected on the fact that women have at least three roles to play: mother, worker and organizer of the household. Thanks to this agreement we will support women in all their roles, giving them, as employees, equal opportunities as their male counterparts and, as mothers, the chance to be close to their children while at work. This might be a modest contribution but an important one nonetheless. Italy needs more children and our initiative wants to play a part in solving the low birth rate problem in a tangible and innovative way . Roberto Benaglia, Secretary General of FIM, said: The agreement represents an initial high-quality result within a great Group, where we have good collaborative industrial relationships. It meets the new needs of working people and indirectly responds to Italy s great need for pro-natal policies and services. This important result increasingly points to the central role of corporate welfare and services within collective bargaining. Signing the agreement at the Ministry of Equal Opportunities and Family in the presence of Minister Bonetti is an excellent sign that should translate into public support policies in this area, beginning with the National Recovery and Resilience Plan. The State cannot meet the increasing need to reconcile family life and work alone: our request is to provide incentives in the form of allowances and financing to support agreements such as this one and drive a rich season of company-level bargaining . Francesca Re David, Secretary General of FIOM, said: Having an adequate number of nurseries is a fundamental right for children and an essential support to working parents, especially women who are penalized in the job market. The participation of businesses and the trade union, together with the local institutions, resumes that initial path that allowed increasing the number of nurseries in this country, respecting their quality, acknowledging the professionalism and rights of early year teachers, and maintaining a positive relationship with the local community. By signing the agreement, Fiom has recognized the value of Fincantieri s decision to go ahead with the plan to gradually build nurseries in all its sites . Rocco Palombella, Secretary General of UILM, commented: A concrete aid to families, making it easier to reconcile work and family life, and a strong message in the direction of equal opportunities and parenting support. This agreement is an important act that is part of the blueprint outlined in the national agreement for metalworkers and responds to our requests on the central role corporate welfare must play in contributing to making it easier for parents to manage their children during working hours and to enhancing the professionalism of workers. It is an excellent initiative resulting from the close collaboration over these past months with the company, a model for all Italian businesses and an essential tool for the future of work .",https://www.fincantieri.com/en/media/press-releases/2022/fincantieri-corporate-nursery-programme-kicks-off/,https://www.fincantieri.com/globalassets/common/header/logo_new.png,Fincantieri

23 DECEMBER 2021,FINCANTIERI: NINTH CRUISE SHIP IN 2021 “VIKING OCTANTIS” DELIVERED,"Trieste, December 23, 2021 Fincantieri has delivered in S viknes (Norway) Viking Octantis , the first of two expedition vessels for Viking. Viking Octantis , as well as her sister ship Viking Polaris , to be delivered next year, can host 378 guests in 189 staterooms. The ships have the Polar Class 6 certification for expeditions in the polar regions, and they have the size to navigate remote areas and the St. Lawrence River and provide superior handling and stability in rough seas. Straight bows, longer hulls and state-of-the-art fin stabilizers will allow the ships to glide over the waves for the calmest possible journey, ice-strengthened hulls will provide the safest way to explore and u-tank stabilizers will significantly decrease rolling by up to 50% when the ships are stationary. Designed by the same experienced nautical architects and engineers that designed Viking s ocean ships, these new vessels feature modern Scandinavian design, intimate spaces and attention to detail, as well as public spaces that are favorites on Viking s ocean ships and new spaces created specifically for expeditions. Giuseppe Bono, CEO of Fincantieri, commented: This result reaffirms our ability to perform very well all over the world even in a situation as complex as the current one. Suffice it to say that Viking Octantis is the ninth cruise unit completed in 2021 in our domestic and foreign sites, without forgetting the deliveries for the US Navy, 2 this year, in the American shipyards. Fincantieri is a Group with a global vocation, which consolidates the leadership positions it has acquired and imposes its own successful production model on four continents . Fincantieri started its partnership with Viking in 2012, trusting the shipowner who was entering the ocean cruise market as a start-up. Today, the cooperation which first began with an order for two ships, has reached a total of 20 units, including Viking Octantis and Viking Polaris and the options. This is an all-time record, the largest number of units ordered to a shipbuilder by one sole shipowner. Other 9 units, options included, will take to the sea from the Group s Italian yards in the next years.",https://www.fincantieri.com/en/media/press-releases/2021/fincantieri-ninth-cruise-ship-in-2021-viking-octantis-delivered/,https://www.fincantieri.com/globalassets/common/header/logo_new.png,Fincantieri
20 DECEMBER 2021,FINCANTIERI TO BUILD A SECOND LSS UNIT FOR THE ITALIAN NAVY,"Trieste, December 20, 2021 The consortium Raggruppamento Temporaneo di Impresa (RTI) led by Fincantieri has signed with OCCAR (Organisation Conjointe de Cooperation sur l Armement, the international organization for joint armament cooperation) a contract for the construction of a second Logistic Support Ship (LSS) for the Italian Navy, which also includes the option for a third ship. The LSS will be entirely built at the Castellammare di Stabia shipyard, with delivery scheduled for 2025. The value of the contract is approx. 410 million euros including the combat system. The order also includes the provision of support over the lifecycle of the vessel in the first ten years, divided into logistics and in-service support (maintenance), as well as the supply of naval components and machinery produced by Fincantieri Mechanical Systems and Components Unit, including shaft lines, steering system, manoeuvring thrusters, fin stabilizers and other handling systems. As part of the multi-year program aimed at safeguarding Italy s Defence at-sea capacity (known as the Naval Act ), Fincantieri is currently building seven multi-purpose offshore patrol vessels (PPA) and the Trieste Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD). Last March, it delivered the Vulcano LSS, a project that was also acquired by the French Navy for the definition of the Flotlog programme, a series of units built in partnership with the Castellammare di Stabia shipyard. The basic characteristic common to all three classes of ships is their very high level of innovation, which makes them extremely flexible in their various profiles of use with a high degree of efficiency. Most importantly, it will be possible to use these units in a complementary way even for non-military-related activities, such as, for example, supporting civil protection in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. Moreover, their environmental impact is low, thanks to advanced low pollution emission generators and electric-drive propulsion motors and biological waste control systems. * * * LSS - Logistic Support Ship The LSS is a vessel that provides logistics support to the fleet, endowed with hospital and healthcare capabilities thanks to the presence of a fully equipped hospital of approximately 800 square metres, which includes: 2 operating rooms with pre-anaesthesia, a radiology room, a dentist s office, a gynecological office, 2 emergency rooms, a clinical diagnosis lab and blood bank, an intensive care room, a CT scan room, and a burns room. The ship combines the ability to transport and transfer to other transport vessels liquid cargo (diesel fuel, jet fuel, fresh water) and solid cargo (spare parts, food and ammunitions) and to perform at sea repairs and maintenance work for other vessels. The defence systems are limited to the capacity of command and control in tactical scenarios, communications, and non-lethal dissuasive defence systems. The LSS is also capable of embarking more complex defence systems and becoming a platform for intelligence and electronic warfare systems. 193 metres long Top speed approx. 20 knots 235 persons including crew and specialists Capacity to supply drinking water to land for approx. 6,000 people Capacity to provide electricity to land with 2,500 kW of power Possibility of embarking up to 28 ISO 20 modules, including residential and healthcare modules Capacity to perform rescues at sea, through recovery and seabed operations (the ship is equipped with two 30-tonne offshore cranes) Base for rescue operations via 2 helicopters and special vessels (2 RHIBs and 2 tenders)",https://www.fincantieri.com/en/media/press-releases/2021/fincantieri-to-build-a-second-lss-unit-for-the-italian-navy/,https://www.fincantieri.com/globalassets/common/header/logo_new.png,Fincantieri

The signing took place between the Commanding General, Adm. Inspector Nicola Carlone, and the CEO of Fincantieri, Giuseppe Bono, the latter representing the two companies, Fincantieri and Cantiere Navale Vittoria, which will operate through a temporary grouping of companies (RTI).

The project combines the Coast Guard s needs with the experience acquired with the patrol vessels Dattilo and Diciotti , delivered by Fincantieri in 2013 and 2014. Thanks to its unique features, the new unit will be able to fulfill the different missions assigned to the Coast Guard by the State laws, ranging from sea rescue to maritime safety, from marine conservation to fish resources protection, as well as civil protection. The ship will be able to operate in long-range deep-sea missions, with a logistical autonomy of at least 20 days, exceeding 4,800 miles, in which thanks to the on-board technologies and advanced communication and discovery systems she will be able to also take on the leading role of coordinating air and naval assets in the operation areas. With a total length of about 85 meters, the vessel will feature excellent sea-keeping qualities, as well as high maneuverability thanks to an azimuth-type electric propulsion system (two azipods), powered by an electrical generation plant, and to two bow thrusters for dynamic positioning, which guarantee the unit s environmental sustainability. The high flexibility and the necessary multi-role capacity of the ship are enhanced by the presence of a large working deck with off-shore cranes and a boarding ramp for wheeled vehicles, together with the flight deck allowing the landing and take-off of helicopters, a dedicated rescue zone with related inflatable boats with rigid keel (Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat), the anti-pollution systems (rec-oil), the hospital area and other equipment. The Coast Guard is growing in step with the development of the Italian shipbuilding industry said Admiral Carlone, Commander General of the Coast Guard, a necessary development for an organization with a strong technological, professional and operational character that has come to establish itself as an excellence of our Country, also recognized internationally . A few months stated Paolo Du , President of the Vittoria Shipyard from the delivery of the last units built for the Italian Coast Guard, the flagship of our fleet, the General Command of the Harbour Authorities has once again recognized our company know-how, gained in the design and construction of military and paramilitary units and we are honored. In this new adventure we will be partner of one of the main world players in the shipbuilding industry to whom we have been united for some time by an important relationship of collaboration. Together with Fincantieri, we will strengthen the operational capabilities of the Port Authority corps, guaranteeing, as always, maximum reliability and compliance with the highest quality standards . Giuseppe Bono, Fincantieri CEO, commented: We are proud to help contributing once more to expand and enhance the operational capabilities of our Coast Guard with a vessel built to carry out a variety of different missions. Indeed, this order confirms the Group s great flexibility, being able today to offer products, in each sector we operate, meeting the specific needs of different customers with the highest technological level on the market .",https://www.fincantieri.com/en/media/press-releases/2021/the-italian-coast-guard-is-to-expand-its-fleet/,https://www.fincantieri.com/globalassets/common/header/logo_new.png,Fincantieri
12 NOVEMBER 2021,SILVERSEA CRUISES TAKES DELIVERY OF 10TH SHIP SILVER DAWN FROM FINCANTIERI IN ANCONA,"Monaco/Ancona -- November 12, 2021 - Leading ultra-luxury cruise lineSilversea Cruises has taken delivery of new ship Silver Dawn at the Fincantieri shipyard in Ancona, Italy. Executives from Silversea Cruises and Fincantieri today attended an intimate delivery ceremony to welcome the 10th ship to the cruise line s fleet. Following a video screening of the official coin and flag ceremonies, Roberto Martinoli Silversea s President and CEO penned his signature to officially take delivery of Silver Dawn. Richard D. Fain Chairman and CEO, Royal Caribbean Group and Jason Liberty Executive Vice President and CFO, Royal Caribbean Group each connected via video feed to deliver a speech. Luigi Matarazzo, General Manager of Fincantieri s Merchant Ships Division, was also in attendance. A testament to the strength and resilience of the global cruise industry, Silver Dawn is the third ship to join Silversea s fleet since the start of 2020. In welcoming the beautiful Silver Dawn as the 10th ship in our fleet, we have reached a huge milestone on our mission to take our guests deep into the world in luxury, says Roberto Martinoli, President & CEO, Silversea Cruises. As well as the tireless efforts of the teams at Fincantieri and Silversea Cruises, I would like to recognise the great contribution of the Royal Caribbean Group. I am grateful for the Group s continued support, which has proven invaluable once again. Silver Dawn represents an evolution of luxury cruise travel; she builds on the innovations of her sister ships, Silver Moon and Silver Muse, with Otium our pioneering new wellness programme. With Silver Dawn, we affirm our position as the leader in ultra-luxury cruising. I look forward to welcoming our guests aboard Silver Dawn from spring 2022 . Luigi Matarazzo, General Manager of Fincantieri s Merchant Ships Division, stated: In spite of the pandemic, we have been able to keep all deliveries in line with the contractual dates. That s why I am particularly pleased to celebrate the delivery of Silver Dawn, just a few months after the successful delivery of her sister vessel, Silver Moon. We have been cooperating with Silversea for many years, realising a line of distinctive vessels, but we are already looking ahead to the new challenges we will have to face, ready for a new generation of cruise vessels . Silver Dawn: An Evolution of Ultra-Luxury Cruise Travel The third ship in the Muse-class series and the fourth ship to result from Silversea s longstanding collaboration with Fincantieri, Silver Dawn is a sistership to Silversea s Silver Muse built in the Fincantieri shipyard of Sestri Ponente (Genoa) in April 2017 and Silver Moon, which was delivered in Ancona in October 2020. Silver Dawn accommodates just 596 guests in 298 ocean-view suites 96% of which have a private veranda and has a crew-to-guest ratio of 1:1.45. In total, over 390 companies contributed to Silver Dawn s construction. In the peak months, an average of 1,000 professionals were working simultaneously on the ship. Over 15,000 steel plates and profiles were cut for her construction, approximately 95,500 litres of paint were applied, and 18 contractors installed approximately 1,690,000m of electric cable. The Otium Wellness Programme: The Original Art of Comfort Building on the success of Silversea s innovative culinary programme, S.A.L.T., which launched aboard Silver Moon, Silver Dawn introduces a pioneering new wellness programme, Otium. In a nod to the cruise line s Italian heritage, Otium takes inspiration from the leisurely nature of the ancient Roman lifestyle. In Roman culture, Otium was a period of time dedicated to leisure, in which people bathed, conversed, sung, theorised, drank, ate, and relaxed. Diverging from existing wellness programmes, Otium encourages balanced indulgence, pampering, and pleasure over sacrifice and delayed gratification. It will provide guests with a customised, multi-dimensional wellness journey throughout Silver Dawn, starting in some of the most spacious suites at sea, growing with a curated range of treatments in the reimagined spa, and trickling out to permeate every moment of the cruise experience. The result is an elevation of Silversea s unique take on luxury. Steve McCurry Photographs Silver Dawn For the first time in his illustrious career, world-renowned photographer and long-term Silversea collaborator Steve McCurry has cast his lens on a working shipyard. McCurry travelled to the Fincantieri facility in Trieste to photograph Silver Dawn from August 4, 2021. As well as photographing the shipyard s workers as Silver Dawn neared completion, McCurry took the opportunity to photograph Silversea s President & CEO, Roberto Martinoli, as well as the ship s Master, Captain Samuele Failla. I had never seen a ship in dry dock before, and was fascinated to see that the entire ship rested and balanced on a series of blocks, says Steve McCurry. It was especially interesting to see the part of the ship which would be underwater. The workers were meticulous as if they were working on a priceless work of art. I was reminded of watching a flower opening up into its full beauty. The craftsmanship and skill with which they worked was extraordinary .

( Fincantieri or the Company ), chaired by Giampiero Massolo, has examined and approved the interim financial information at September 30, 2021[8]. During the Board meeting Giuseppe Bono, Chief Executive Officer of Fincantieri, said: The growth of the Group, supported by the current backlog, reflects the order preservation strategy we adopted during the pandemic. We have already reached one of the highest marginality levels in the industry, that we now aim to improve, along with volumes, also thanks to the significant investment plan carried out across all our shipyards. Our engineering and project management skills are among the best worldwide and our shipyards are on the cutting edge both in terms of production and quality. This comes mainly from the sense of belonging of our people. We are well prepared to face the upcoming years, also strengthened by the recent recruiting program of young employees able to quickly embrace the company culture and the competences needed for the job . Bono concluded: In the collective consciousness, the ship is a vision: to build it, strong and always evolving skills are needed together with a strong passion. Therefore, I want to thank all Fincantieri employees and our supply-chain that allow us to maintain the Group global leadership, ensuring our sustainable growth in the future. In this endeavor, I am sure we can count on our stakeholders and on the network of companies we work with .

The increase in revenues showcase the positive trend across all the Group segments. The Shipbuilding revenues were up by 28.5% (excluding pass-through activities), with production volumes at record level in the Group s Italian shipyards +34% vs 9M 2020 (12.3 million of production hours as of September 30, 2021), confirming the pre-pandemic growth trajectory and marginality levels. Revenues in the Offshore and Specialized Vessel segment increased by 15.3% in the first nine months of 2021, recovering the volumes lost in the first part of the year. The Equipment, Systems and Services segment revenues increased by 29.1%, driven once again by operations in support of cruise and naval vessels, and partially by the acquisition of INSO group. As of September 30, 2021, 88% of the revenue base has been represented by international clients, higher than the 85% reported last year. In the first nine months, the Group EBITDA, at euro 330 million (euro 200 million at September 30, 2020), reflects the significant improvements in production volumes and marginality. EBITDA margin, excluding pass-through activities, is equal to 7.3%, compared to 5.7% at September 30, 2020. 9M marginality reflects the positive operating performance, with four ships delivered in the third quarter alone. As of September 30, 2021, Offshore and Specialized Vessels EBITDA stands positive, in line with the previous quarters of the year, as a result of the repositioning strategy in more promising sectors.

Revenues for the period refer to the cruise ship business area for euro 2,849 million (euro 2,267 million at September 30, 2020), up by 25.7%, and to the naval business area for euro 1,140 million (euro 837 million at September 30, 2020), up by 36.3% vs 9M 2020. They respectively account for 56% and 23% of the Group s revenues, showing a higher contribution of the naval business area when compared to September 30, 2020 (57% and 21%). The cruise business revenues trend is boosted by the resumption of activities at full speed in the Group s Italian shipyards, with record production volumes despite the safety protocols put in place to face the spread of COVID-19. The ongoing focus to create further efficiencies in engineering and production processes, together with the investments carried out in the last few years, allowed the Group to fully ensure the production programs, with six cruise ships delivered in the period, four of which in the sole third quarter. The surge in production value for the naval business, excluding pass-through activities related to the FREMM unit delivered in April, is mainly related to the progress in the program for the Qatari Ministry of Defence, with the third corvette of the program launched at the end of September and the first one of the Al Zubarah class delivered at the end of October. Moreover, revenues of the naval business record the positive contribution of the Foreign Military Sales program between the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as well as the contribution of the FFG-62 program developed by the US subsidiary FMG. These programs respectively envisage the supply of four Multi-Mission Surface Combatant and the construction of the first frigate within the Constellation program. The segment s EBITDA at euro 303 million as of September 30, 2021, up by 58.4% when compared to the first nine months of 2020 (euro 191 million), confirms the Group strategy to take the operating performance back to the pre-pandemic levels. EBITDA margin at 7.6%, excluding pass-through activities (7.2% if considering total revenues), improved significantly from 6.2% recorded on September 30, 2020, thanks to the improvements of the engineering and production processes mentioned above.

Such trend reflects the successful repositioning strategy towards more promising segments like the offshore wind. As of September 30, 2021, VARD s order book includes eight SOV (Service Operation Vessel) units on top of four options for the maintenance of offshore wind farms, mostly acquired during the first nine months of 2021, becoming market leader. As of September 30, 2021, the segment s EBITDA stands at a positive euro 6 million (zero at September 30, 2020), with an EBITDA margin at 2.0% (0.0% at September 30, 2020). The EBITDA quarterly trend confirms the successful repositioning strategy towards segments characterized by broader market opportunities.

Such increase is mainly related to the development of the solid backlog for the services provided as part of naval programs and to the Complete accommodation business area, driven by the cruise volumes developed in the period as well as by the impacts of INSO group acquisition, consolidated starting from June 2021. The segment s EBITDA at September 30, 2021 stands at euro 52 million (euro 37 million at September 30, 2020), with an EBITDA margin at 6.9% (6.3% at September 30, 2020). The third quarter marginality is significantly higher than the previous quarters of 2021, thanks to the positive contribution across all business areas, despite the lower Ship Repair and Conversion contribution.

Net working capital is negative at euro 398 million (negative at euro 202 million at December 31, 2020). The decrease mainly refer to the reduction in Construction contracts and clients advances (euro 526 million), due to the delivery of cruise vessels in the period and the subsequent reduction of Construction loans and of Other current assets and liabilities (euro 70 million). This was mainly related to the decrease of credits with shipowners as well as the increase in payables to personnel for deferred wages. Construction loans, dedicated credit instruments used for the exclusive financing of the projects to which they are referred to, as of September 30, 2021, amount to euro 976 million, with a decrease of euro 349 million compared to December 31, 2020, recorded to the parent Company for euro 815 million and to the subsidiary VARD for euro 161 million. Consolidated net financial position[9] reports a net debt balance at euro 1,059 million, substantially in line with the figure as at December 31, 2020 (net debt at euro 1,062 million) and with the expectations for 2021. Such figure is consistent with the production volumes trend as well as with the delivery schedule, which saw four cruise vessels delivered in the third quarter 2021. Furthermore, it should be noted that the Net financial position is still affected by the strategy of the deferrals granted to clients (euro 298 million at September 30, 2021) adopted in order to preserve the sizeable backlog and to strengthen the mutual relationships. Such payments, according to the deferrals agreed with the shipowners, are deemed to occur during the fourth quarter of 2021 and in 2022.

For this reason, the cruise unit, Coral Geographer, built by an offshore shipyard for Australian company Coral Expeditions, has been included among Offshore and Specialized Vessels deliveries. BUSINESS OUTLOOK The implementation of strict safety protocols put in place to face the pandemic once again affected the first nine months of the year. Fincantieri extended its corporate vaccination campaign to the suppliers workforce, activating vaccination hubs in all the Italian shipyards. Moreover, since October 15, access to the Italian sites has been restricted only to workers complying with the Law Decree no. 127 of September 21, 2021. To date, it is unlikely that such measures could significantly alter the production in Italian shipyards and production sites. As for the Group s foreign shipyards, the actions adopted to limit the spread of COVID-19 remain in place with different impacts in each country. In particular, the spread of the virus is still affecting Romanian and Vietnamese shipyards, even though relevant impacts on both production activities and on the Group s economic and financial performance are not to be expected. The cruise industry continues to experience a significant resumption of activities, with 206 ships in service (equal to 57% of global fleet) from 65 different cruise operators (as of October 2021). According to the main shipowners, the number of vessels in service is expected to reach 70% to 80% of their fleets by the end of the year. This relapse benefits from an extremely solid trend in bookings, as pointed out by all main operators, such as Carnival, which announced on its August earnings results higher booking levels for the second half 2022 compared with the same period of 2019, with no reduction on ticket prices. With such premises and in light of the nine months results, the Group confirms an increase in volumes for 2021, consistent with the projected trends of revenues up by 25%-30%, excluding pass-through activities, and EBITDA margin now over 7%, notwithstanding the surge in commodity and energy prices compared to past levels. The Q4 marginality is expected to be in line with the previous two quarters. Furthermore, the Group envisages a Net financial position in line with 2020, despite the increase in production activities in the cruise business. Regarding finance costs, over 80% of medium to long term debt is at fixed rate. Therefore a potential increase in interest rates would not impact significantly the Group s results. Furthermore, the Company is constantly monitoring interest rates, gauging opportunities to increase the percentage of fixed rate credit facilities through hedging positions. The strategic decisions taken by the Group allowed a quick recovery in terms of operations, despite the adjustments to comply with the regulations against the spread of the pandemic. On top of this, the sizeable backlog in the Shipbuilding segment has been preserved. Thus, in the short-medium term, production levels are expected to continue at full speed, benefiting from the operating lever and thanks to the solid coverage of industrial fixed costs structure. This will grant greater cash generation and progressive deleveraging. Moreover, the backlog, especially in cruise, is strictly linked to projects and contracts signed with an adequate price level (and consequent marginality) and a greater portion, among ships, of repeated units instead of prototypes. In conclusion, planning and design processes revision, started in the past years, contributed to the positive performances with reference to the last units delivered in 2021. Furthermore, the benefits from the significant investment plan, with regard to both production and technology, now close to completion, will begin to show encouraging results in the following years. Looking at our people strategy, investments in human capital translated into educational programs aimed at developing technical-managerial competences, with a particular focus on highly motivated youth able to spread the company culture, in order to respond to the upcoming Group needs. The combination of these factors allows the Group to conclude that the impact on projects margins following the increase in commodity prices can be offset without affecting the Group s marginality in a relevant manner. * * * The Manager Responsible for Preparing Financial Reports, Felice Bonavolont , declares, pursuant to paragraph 2 of article 154 bis of Italian Legislative Decree no. 58 dated February 24, 1998, that the information contained in this press release corresponds to the underlying documentary and accounting books and records. * * * For the significant events occurring during the period and after the reporting period, please refer to the press releases available on the Company s website (www.fincantieri.com).

Please, refer to the paragraph Alternative Performance Measures (3) Profit/(loss) for the period before extraordinary and non-recurring income and expenses (4) This figure does not include construction loans and it includes non-recurrent financial receivables The percentages contained in this Press Release have been calculated with reference to amounts expressed in thousands of euros Financial and economic results for the first half of 2021 Revenue and income (euro/million) 30.06.2021 30.06.2021 (excluding pass-through activities[6]) 30.06.2020 Delta vs. 30.06.2020 Delta % vs. 30.06.2020 Shipbuilding 2,916 2,691 2,031 660 32.5% Offshore and Specialized Vessels 220 220 228 (8) (3.5%) Equipment, Systems and Services 481 481 392 89 22.8% Consolidation adjustments (366) (366) (282) (84) 29.8% Total 3,251 3,026 2,369 657 27.7% Revenue and income, at euro 3,026 million for the first half of 2021, excluding pass-through activities at euro 225 million, spiked by 27.7% compared to 1H 2020. The rise in revenues is driven by the positive performance of the Shipbuilding segment (+32.5%, excluding pass-through activities), reflecting the full resumption of production activities in the Group s Italian yards and thus the recovery of 2020 volumes lost due to the shutdown of activities led by the COVID-19 outbreak. The Equipment, Systems and Services segment recorded an increase in revenues (+22.8%) mainly attributable to supporting shipbuilding activities for cruise and naval vessels. In the first semester of 2021, the Offshore and Specialized Vessels segment registered revenues in line with the same period of the previous year (-3.5%), partially recovering the volumes lost in 1Q 2021. The revenue trend is affected by the negative net effect (euro 15 million) from the conversion of revenues in US Dollars and Norwegian Krone generated by foreign subsidiaries. As of June 30, 2021 88% of revenues are generated with foreign customers, rising from the 84% figure of the same semester, last year. EBITDA, at euro 219 million (euro 119 million as of June 30, 2020) benefits from both higher production volumes and enhanced marginality, including as well the effects of soaring commodity prices. EBITDA margin, excluding pass-through activities, improved from 5.5% in 1H 2020 to 7.2% in 1H 2021, recovering well beyond the contribution lost due to production downtime in 1H 2020 in the Group s Italian shipyards led by the COVID-19 outbreak (euro 65 million). The higher contribution is mainly attributable to the Shipbuilding segment (EBITDA margin at 7.7% excluding pass-through activities). VARD Offshore recorded a positive EBITDA, the strategic decisions taken by the management starting from 2019 as part of the restructuring plan, which has followed the delisting of the Norwegian Group. EBIT stands at euro 123 million, euro 54 million in the same period of 2020, with an EBIT margin (EBIT on Revenue and income, excluding pass-through activities) at 4.1% (2.3% in 1H 2020). The improvement is due, in addition to the reasons illustrated above with reference to the Group s EBITDA, to lower amortization following the reclassification as extraordinary costs of the operational amortization, driven by the shutdown of activities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusted Net Income for the period is positive at euro 49 million as of June 30, 2021 (negative at euro 29 million in 1H 2020). Finance income and expenses amount to a negative euro 45 million (negative at euro 63 million as of June 30, 2021) and include the change in profits and losses on exchange rates (decreasing by euro 21 million, considering last semester loss led by the conversion of the financing in US Dollar for the Brazilian subsidiary Vard Promar) and the decrease (of approximately euro 10 million) of the financial components linked to hedging derivatives (in 2020, one out of the two vessels denominated in US Dollar was delivered). Such improvements were partially offset by the higher devaluation of financial credits (up by euro 9 million), and the increased net finance costs on financial exposure in the period. Income and expenses on Investments amount to zero (negative at euro 3 million at June 30, 2020) as net effect of the proceeds (euro 14 million) resulting from the difference between the contractual price and the INSO Group s assets at the time of the acquisition, offset by the acquisition of losses generated by some of INSO associated companies. Extraordinary and non-recurring income and expenses are negative at euro 53 million (euro 139 million at June 30, 2020) and include: i) costs associated to asbestos-related litigation for euro 29 million, ii) costs connected with the measures put in place to ensure employees health and safety at euro 22 million against COVID-19 outbreak, iii) other non-recurring expenses for euro 2 million. As of June 30, 2020, COVID-19 expenses included the reduced operating leverage let by production downtime (at approximately euro 65 million, including euro 17 million in depreciation and amortization). Profit for the period is euro 7 million (net loss of euro 137 million in 1H 2020) for the reasons previously mentioned. The Group share is a net profit of euro 6 million, when it was a net loss of euro 135 million in the same period of the previous year. Net invested capital, at June 30, 2021, amount to euro 2,421 million, increased compared to euro 1,867 million at June 30, 2020. Namely, Net fixed capital presents an overall rise of euro 123 million. Among the relevant charges, it should be noted i) the inclusion into Rights of use of new leased contracts signed by some subsidiaries; ii) the increase in value of Property, plant and equipment at euro 89 million, including the partial offset of the investments carried out in the period (euro 136 million) and the positive impact of the foreign currency translation of financial statements (euro 9 million) by the depreciation and amortization of the period (euro 51 million) and the reduction in fixed assets (euro 20 million) as a result of VARD s transfer of a vessels formerly recorded under assets under construction, into a subsidiary operating in the Offshore sector and iii) the higher amount of the item Investments (euro 14 million) due to the above mentioned transfer. Net working capital report a positive balance at euro 263 million (negative at euro 202 million at December 31, 2020), with an increase of euro 465 million. The main changes are related to: i) decrease in Construction contracts and client advances (euro 297 million) due to the progress of projects during the period and to the invoicing of the final installment of a cruise ship delivered in July; ii) increase in Trade receivables (euro 753 million) due to the already mentioned invoicing; iii) decrease in Trade payables (euro 99 million) primarily due to the payment of the debt registered at the end of 2020 to purchase back two FREMM class frigates from the subsidiary Orizzonte, which were subsequently sold; iv) contraction in Other current assets and liabilities (euro 75 million) mainly led by the dwindle of credits with shipowners and by the increased payables to personnel for deferred wages and salaries. The Consolidated net financial position, which excludes the construction loans, reports a net debt balance of euro 1,617 million (net debt of euro 1,062 million at December 31, 2020). The increase, in line with forecasts, is consistent with production volumes and with the delivery schedule, which envisages six cruise ships in the remaining part of the year (three deliveries in July with receipts of approximately euro 1.5 billion). Receipts in July brought to a negative Net Financial Position of approximately euro 1.2 billion, which will then adjust, at year-end, to expected values lower than the peak registered in March 2021 and consistent with the value reported at December 31, 2020. This shows once again how significantly both production timeline and delivery schedule deeply affect the Net Debt. Furthermore, it should be noted that the Net financial position is affected by the strategy of the deferrals granted to the clients (euro 423 million at June 30, 2021), adopted in 2020 in order to safeguard the sizeable backlog as well as to strengthen the relationships with them. The amounts are expected to be recovered, according to the deferrals agreed with shipowners, during the second half of 2021 and throughout 2022. Construction loans, as of June 30, 2021, amount to euro 1,278 million, with a decrease of euro 47 million compared to December 31, 2020, of which euro 1,090 million related to the Parent Company and euro 188 million to VARD. Given the nature of construction loans and particularly the fact that these types of loans are obtained and can be used exclusively to finance the contracts to which they refer, management treats them in the same way as client advances and so classifies them as part of Net working capital. In the first semester 2021, profitability indicators, ROI and ROE, were respectively 5.8% and 0.9%. The changes in ROI and ROE, compared to the previous semester, are mainly attributable to the operating results, EBIT and Net result, which recorded a recovery in marginality. With regard to the indicators of strength and efficiency of the capital structure, they reflect the increase in the Group s Total debt and Net financial position, mainly attributable to the delivery schedule which envisages six cruise ships to be delivered in 2H 2021 (three of which in July alone). Group operational results and performance indicators for the first half of 2021 Order intake, backlog and deliveries In the first six month of 2021, the Group recorded euro 1,753 million in new orders, compared with euro 1,723 million of the same period of 2020, with a book-to-bill ratio (new orders/revenues) of 0.6 (0.7 at June 30, 2020). 31.12.2020 Order intake (euro/million) 30.06.2021 30.06.2020 Amount % Amount % Amount % 2,969 66 FINCANTIERI S.p.A. 273 16 610 35 1,557 34 Rest of Group 1,480 84 1,113 65 4,526 100 Total 1,753 100 1,723 100 3,716 82 Shipbuilding 1,080 62 1,364 79 487 11 Offshore and Specialized Vessels 174 10 164 10 649 14 Equipment, Systems and Services 665 38 322 19 (326) (7) Consolidation adjustments (166) (10) (127) (8) 4,526 100 Total 1,753 100 1,723 100 The Group s total backlog reached euro 37 billion at June 30, 2021, comprising euro 27.6 billion of backlog (euro 28.0 billion at June 30, 2020) and euro 9.4 billion of soft backlog (euro 9.9 billion at June 30, 2020) with development of the contracts in portfolio up to 2029.

Capital expenditure represented 5.3% of the Group s revenue in the first six months of 2021, compared with 5.2% in 1H 2020. Capital expenditure in the first half of 2021 were mainly aimed at further strengthening Fincantieri s positioning in the shipbuilding segment, both naval and cruise. The measures undertaken are aimed at adjusting European and US shipyards for the development of the sizable backlog and to establish a more efficient and technologically advanced production process, contributing to improve the margins of projects that are about to start. Headcount The headcount went from 20,150 units at December 31, 2020, to 20,784 units at June 30, 2021. In Italy, there has been a 5.0% increase, going from 9,844 units at December 31, 2020 to 10,336 units at June 30, 2021. Such increase is mainly attributable to the incorporation of INSO s personnel and its subsidiary SOF s personnel, having completed the acquisition of the company in early June 2021. Deliveries The following table shows the deliveries scheduled each year, analyzed by the main business units.

It should be noted that the delivery of one cruise ship for shipowner Viking has been anticipated from January 2022 to December 2021 (**) As of June 30, 2021 two vessels have been removed from the order book due to the failure to verify the conditions precedent required for the effectiveness of the contract (***) Vessels in order book for the main business units as of June 30, 2021 (****) For the purpose of representing the Fincantieri Group s operating segments, VARD shipyards have been divided into Cruise and Offshore. For this reason, the cruise unit, Coral Geographer, built by an offshore shipyard for Australian company Coral Expeditions, has been included among Offshore and Specialized Vessels deliveries Business Outlook In a situation in which the health emergency still has significant effects on working and social habits of individuals, the Group keeps on implementing strict health protocols. Such efforts allowed Fincantieri to achieve the zero infection target within its production sites during the first week of July. Furthermore, Fincantieri has recently activated its corporate vaccination campaign in all shipyards, starting with Sestri, deciding to bear the costs of managing the company vaccination points for the suppliers workforce as well. The cruise business has been severely affected by the pandemic, however, based on the schedules released on July 13 by cruise ship operators, a significant resumption of activities is now to be expected: 141 cruise ships will be back in service by the end of July, with 50 brands already sailing worldwide[7]. The resumption of cruise operations, along with the growing booking trend and the confidence in the main cruise companies demonstrated by the financial markets, shows yet again the sector s resilience. Indeed, most cruise operators witnessed an increase in bookings, a trend that is not just consistent with historical ones, but for some operators is actually higher. On the base of such considerations and on the results at June 30, 2021, the Group is able to confirm for 2021, as of today, a projected increase in volumes consistent with the expected growth (revenues up by over 25%, excluding pass-through activities) with margins as forecasted, even despite of commodity rising prices regarding the production scheduled for the coming years. Consistently with previous plans and accordingly to the cruise deliveries schedule in 2H 2021, Net financial position as of July 31, 2021 amounts to negative euro 1.2 billion, taking into account receipts of euro 1.5 billion, following the delivery of three cruise vessels in the month. Net debt will adjust, at year-end, to expected values lower than the peek registered in March and in line with 2020 year-end. Such dynamic shows once again how Net Debt is significantly affected by both production program and delivery schedule. The Shipbuilding segment confirms, for the second half of the year, the forecasted significant increase in production volumes compared to those achieved in 2020. With regard to the cruise ship business area, four vessels are to be delivered from the Group s Italian shipyards (three of which were delivered in July: Valiant Lady for Virgin Voyages, MSC Seashore for MSC and Rotterdam for HAL, and one in the fourth quarter - Silver Dawn for SilverSea) and two vessels in the luxury-niche segment by VARD s cruise division (Ponant Icebreaker, Viking Octantis). In the naval business area, the expected business volumes for the current financial year have been confirmed, with the delivery of three vessels by Italian shipyards, in addition to two vessels delivered by US shipyards. Work is expected to begin on the construction of the first vessel in the FFG-62 program for the US Navy in the fourth quarter of 2021 (to be delivered in 2026). The Offshore ad Specialized Vessels segment forecasts a growth in volumes for the period compared to 2020 levels and the delivery of two ships. As for the Equipment, Systems and Services segment, the following are to be expected: in the Service business area, development of the backlog generated by the recent contracts signed with the Italian Navy and the Qatari Ministry of Defence, as well as the completion of repair and conversion for shipowner Windstar for Complete Accommodation, increased volumes supported by the activities for the supply of cabins, wet units and public rooms, as well as windows and catering for Electronics, Systems and Software, a significant growth led by the activities carried out in the defence system business in the naval sector and in solutions for the monitoring and safety of critical infrastructure in the Energy business area, the synergic development of activities related to mechanical and power electronics systems, as well as the continuation of activities for integrating new strategic technologies (e.g. hybrid propulsion, emissions reduction, clean energy generation) for Infrastructure, the launch of activities related to the construction of the MSC terminal in Miami and the gradual consolidation of ongoing operations of the companies recently acquired by the INSO group In the medium-long term, the Group remains committed to developing the backlog acquired over the years. In virtue of the recognitions received for the versatility and for the quality of its products, Fincantieri has further strengthened its position in the Defence sector with the new contracts signed and the important negotiations being held with several international Navies around the world. These successes will lead the Group to achieve an ever larger contribution from the naval business area, with expected benefits in terms of marginality and cash flows. Moreover, it should be noted that the potential stabilization of commodities prices to higher values than those recorded at the beginning of 2021, with potential effects on future production, as of today, is not deemed to have significant effects on the marginality in the medium term. The stability is assured, among other things, by the benefits of ongoing investments to make the production process even more efficient and more technologically advanced. The Group s strategic choices have led to a rapid recovery from the pandemic crisis of 2020 and, consequently, the positive results reported. Such achievements confirm Fincantieri s ability to quickly address the emergency and go back to pre-pandemic growth levels, showing its capacity to return to the levels of marginality embedded in the current order book.

Please, refer to the paragraph Alternative Performance Measures Revenue and income Shipbuilding sector revenues at June 30, 2021, excluding pass-through activities at euro 225 million, amount to euro 2.691 million, up by 32.5% compared to the same period in 2020. Revenues for the period refer to the cruise ship business area for euro 1,902 million (euro 1,504 million at June 30, 2020), up by 26.4% and to the naval business area for euro 789 million (euro 526 million at June 30, 2020), up by 49.8%. They respectively account for 56% and 23% of the Group s revenues, highlighting a higher incidence of the naval business area revenues compared to 1H 2020 (57% and 20%). Cruise ship business area revenues confirm the trend already set in the fourth quarter 2020, as a result of the resumption of activities in full swing in all the Group s shipyards, committed to developing the significant backlog acquired. In 1H 2021, two of the eight cruise ships, scheduled for the year, were delivered. It should be noted that three out of six cruise ships are to be delivered in the month of July (Valiant Lady for Virgin Voyages, MSC Seashore for MSC Cruises and Rotterdam for Holland America Line). The increase in production value for the naval business area, excluding pass-through activities relating to the FREMM unit delivered in April, reflects the progress in the Italian Navy s fleet renewal program; the first LSS (Logistic Support Ship) unit - Vulcano - was delivered in March, while the first of seven PPA (Multipurpose Offshore Patrol Ship) is expected to be delivered in the second part of the year. The increase in revenues is also attributable to the progress in the program for the Qatari Ministry of Defence, whose first corvette is set to be delivered in 2H 2021, and to other activities for orders acquired by the Parent Company. Furthermore, the business area revenues also include the contribution of the US subsidiary FMG, which continues to develop the LCS program as well as the Foreign Military Sales program between the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which envisages the supply of four Multi-Mission Surface Combatants, and the FFG-62 program. EBITDA The segment s EBITDA, as of June 30, 2021, stands at euro 206 million, improving compared to 1H 2020 (euro 115 million), thus confirming the growth strategy and the guidelines outlined by the Group before the pandemic. EBITDA margin, at 7.7% excluding pass-through activities (7.1% when considering total revenues), is increased when compared to the 5.7% at June 30, 2020, proving the Group s ability to return to the margins embedded in the current backlog. Deliveries The vessels delivered were: LSS Vulcano , first vessel in the Italian Navy s renewable fleet program, at the Muggiano shipyard; Viking Venus , the first of five vessels to be delivered by Italian shipyards to shipowner Viking, at the Ancona shipyard; LCS 21 USS Minneapolis St. Paul at the US Marinette shipyard (Wisconsin); one multi-mission frigate (FREMM), at the Muggiano shipyard (La Spezia); Hanseatic Spirit , the third of a new series of small luxury expedition cruise vessels for Hapag-Lloyd Cruises, at the Langsten shipyard (Norway).

Please, refer to the paragraph Alternative Performance Measures Revenue and income Revenues from the Offshore and Specialized Vessels segment at June 30, 2021, amount to euro 220 million, broadly in line with revenues at June 30, 2020 (-3.5%), partially recovering the volumes lost in the first quarter 2021. Such trend highlights the recovery of the volumes lost following the downsizing of production capacity with the shutdown of the Brevik shipyard, still active in the first six months of 2020, thanks to the redefinition of the product portfolio and of the backlog, in view of the repositioning into more promising sectors, such as the offshore wind. EBITDA EBITDA for the segment at June 30, 2021 is positive at euro 4 million (negative at euro 1 million at June 30, 2020), with EBITDA margin at 1.9% (-0.4% at June 30, 2020). EBITDA in 2021 first semester benefits from the effects of the restructuring and reorganization plan launched in 2019 and it reflects the first signs of the repositioning strategy in sectors with broader market opportunities. Deliveries The following vessels were delivered during the period: 1 expedition cruise vessel, for shipowner Coral Expeditions at the Vung Tau shipyard (Vietnam); 1 fishery vessel for the customer Luntos Co. at the Vung Tau shipyard (Vietnam).

Please, refer to the paragraph Alternative Performance Measures Revenue and income Revenues from Equipment, Systems and Services segment account for euro 481 million, up by 22.8% compared to the first semester 2020. Such increase is mainly attributable to the Complete accommodation business area, driven by the cruise volumes developed in the period and by the considerable backlog for the services part of naval contracts. The segment s business areas are ramping up production activities of their backlog, while strengthening their own positioning in the respective markets. EBITDA The segment s EBITDA as of June 30, 2021 is equal to euro 32 million (euro 24 million at June 30, 2020), with an EBITDA margin at 6.6% (6.0% at June 30, 2020). The margins recorded in the period is significantly improved compared to the first quarter of the year (4.5%) and it reflects the positive contribution of the different business areas, while being affected by the lower contribution of the Ship Repair and Conversion business area.

In particular, EBITDA, in the configuration monitored by the Group, is used as the main earnings indicator, as it enables the Group s underlying profitability to be assessed, by eliminating the impact of volatility associated with non-recurring items or extraordinary items outside the ordinary course of business (please, refer to the reclassified consolidated income statement); the EBITDA configuration adopted by the Group might not be consistent with the configurations adopted by other companies. As required by Consob Communication no. 0092543 of December 3, 2015 which implements the ESMA Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures (document no. ESMA/2015/1415), the components of each of these measures are described below: EBITDA: this is equal to earnings before taxes, before finance income and costs, before income and expenses from investments and before depreciation, amortization and impairment, as reported in the financial statements, adjusted to exclude the following items: provisions for costs and legal expenses associated with lawsuits brought by employees for asbestos related damages; charges connected to the impacts of COVID-19 outbreak, referring mainly to the failure to absorb fixed production costs during the shutdown of activities in 2020, the impact of reduced efficiency resulting from the implementation of the preventive measures adopted, and the costs for sanitary aids and expenses to ensure employee health and safety; costs relating to reorganization plans and non-recurring other personnel costs; other expenses or income outside the ordinary course of business due to particularly significant nonrecurring events. EBIT: this is equal to EBITDA after deducting recurring depreciation, amortization and impairment (this excludes impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment recognized as a result of impairment tests). Profit/(loss) before extraordinary and non-recurring income and expenses: this is equal to profit/(loss) for the period before adjustments for non-recurring items or those outside the ordinary course of business, which are reported before the related tax effect. Net fixed capital: this reports the fixed assets used in the business and includes the following items: Intangible assets, Rights of use, Property, plant and equipment, Investments and Other non-current assets (including the fair value of derivatives classified in non-current Financial assets and non-current Financial liabilities) net of Employee benefits. Net working capital: this is equal to capital employed in ordinary operations, which includes Inventories and advances, Construction contracts and client advances, Construction loans, Trade receivables, Trade payables, Provisions for risks and charges, and Other current assets and liabilities (including Income tax assets, Income tax liabilities, Deferred tax assets and Deferred tax liabilities, as well as the fair value of derivatives classified in current Financial assets and current Financial liabilities). Net invested capital: this is equal to the total of Net fixed capital, Net working capital, and Net assets/ (liabilities) to be sold and discontinued operations. The Net financial position monitored by management includes: - Net current cash/(debt): cash and cash equivalents, held-for-trading securities, current financial receivables, current financial debt (excluding construction loans), current portion of long-term loans and credit facilities, other current financial liabilities; - Net non-current cash/(debt): non-current financial receivables, non-current financial debt, bonds, other non-current financial liabilities. ROI (Return on investment) is calculated as the ratio between EBIT of the period and the arithmetic mean of Net Invested Capital at the beginning and the end of the reporting period. ROE (Return on equity) is calculated as the ration between Profit/(loss) for the period and the arithmetic mean of Total Equity at the beginning and end of the period. Total debt/Total equity: this is calculated as the ratio between Total debt and Total equity. Net financial position/EBITDA: this is calculated by the Group as the ratio between the Net financial position, as monitored by the Group, and EBITDA. Net financial position/Total equity: this is calculated as the ratio between the Net financial position, as monitored by the Group, and Total equity. Revenue and income excluding pass-through activities: Revenue and income excluding the portion relating to sale contracts with pass-through activities, whose value is exactly offset by the corresponding cost; pass-through activities are defined as contracts whole value is entirely invoiced by the Group to the final client, but whose construction activities are not managed directly by the Group. Provisions: these refer to increases in the Provisions for risks and charges, and impairment of Trade receivables and Other non-current and current assets.

The program relating to the first-in-class unit envisages the tender for the Basic Design starting from the second half of 2021, whereas the detail design and construction will begin in the following years. The signing took place between Jung Woo Sung, Vice President Naval & Special Ship Marketing Division of DSME, and Marco Cerruti, Regional Sales Manager of Fincantieri, in the presence of Federico Failla, Italian Ambassador in Seoul, Vice Admiral Dario Giacomin, Deputy Defense General Secretary Deputy National Armament Director, and Rear Admiral Antonio Natale, Advisor of the Chief of Staff of the Italian Navy. Fincantieri will advise DSME based on the expertise gained with the construction of the LHD (Landing Helicopter Dock) Trieste , which will be delivered next year to the Italian Navy. With this agreement, Fincantieri strengthens its presence in the country, further boosting the relationship with the Republic of Korea. In fact, through its subsidiary Seastema, the Group is cooperating in the construction of eight new Daegu class frigates (FFX-II) for the national Navy, providing SEASNavy, an innovative integrated platform management system (IPMS). The signing of this contract marks an important step for the Group in establishing a strategic cooperation with DSME. In a country with high naval shipbuilding capabilities, such cooperation might provide significant supplies for this unit and it might be extended to other products or sectors in the future. The Trieste unit s design represents the state-of-the-art for this class of ships, in addition to being a well-proven product fully meeting the operational requirements of the Korean Navy. With the LHD, Fincantieri has proven its ability to design and build highly innovative units which represent a benchmark in the international scenario.",https://www.fincantieri.com/en/media/press-releases/2021/fincantieri-to-support-daewoo-in-the-design-of-the-new-korean-aircraft-carriers/,https://www.fincantieri.com/globalassets/common/header/logo_new.png,Fincantieri

( Fincantieri or the Company ), chaired by Giampiero Massolo, has examined and approved the interim financial information at March 31, 2021[10]. During the Board meeting Giuseppe Bono, Chief Executive Officer of Fincantieri, said: The results of the first quarter picture an healthy Group able, as expected, to confirm the guidance, with growing revenues and increased margins. Alongside such an encouraging performance, together with an overall slight economic recovery and also by virtue of the progress made in dealing with the pandemic, we welcome both the cautious resumption of cruise activities in Europe and the one that will shortly follow in the United States. Those steps forward have only been possible through the rigorous implementation of all the health protocols applied by shipowners, making ships a safe place, and through the technologies, for the air sanitation and for countering the chance of infections, that have been developed to date. It should as well be noted how the cruise booking trend for 2022 is in line with and, in some cases, even better than the pre-pandemic levels. Bono concluded: I would like to point out that at the heart of our operations lies an important task we are carrying out, at the service of the Italian government, alongside with other large national and international Groups; we truly believe that a collaboration among the best industrial companies, for projects developed as part of the Recovery Plan, will actively contribute to our Country s renaissance . ECONOMIC DATA 31.12.2020 (euro/million) 31.03.2021 31.03.2020 5,879 Revenue and income 1,648 1,307 5,191 Revenue and income excluding pass-through activities (*) 1,426 1,307 314 EBITDA (**) 101 72 5.3% EBITDA margin 6.1% 5.5% 6.1% EBITDA margin excluding pass-through activities (*) 7.0% 5.5% (*) Refer to the definition present in the paragraph Alternative Performance Measures (**) This figure does not include extraordinary and non-recurrent income and expenses; please, refer to the paragraph Alternative Performance Measures In the first quarter 2021, revenues and income, at euro 1,426 million, excluding pass-through activities (euro 222 million), increased by 9.1%, compared to the same quarter of 2020. Q1 production volumes exceeded those reported in the first quarter last year, fully recovering the shortfall caused by the suspension of production activites at the Group s Italian shipyards and production sites, owing to the COVID-19 outbreak. The results are in line with expectations, marking a step forward towards 2021 targets, with revenues expected to increase considerably in the remaining part of the year as a consequence of the ramp up needed for the development of the hefty workload and to meet the delivery schedule. The higher revenues and volumes achieved are driven by the full resumption of production activities in all the Group s shipyards and production sites. The increase, compared to the first quarter of 2020, is a combination, on one hand, of the positive trend in the Shipbuilding (+12.8%, excluding pass-through activities) and in the Equipment, Systems and Services (+13.4%) segments and, on the other hand, of the decrease in revenues recorded in the Offshore and Specialized vessels segment (-23.5%). Group EBITDA, at euro 101 million (euro 72 million at March 31, 2020), recovered well beyond the margin lost in the first quarter of 2020 due to the lack of progress on naval projects during the suspension of activities (euro 15 million); EBITDA margin, excluding pass-through activities, stands at 7.0% (5.5% at March 31, 2020). The improved marginality confirms the performance of the fourth quarter 2020 (6.9%) and it is in line with the guidance for 2021.

The cruise ship business area marks an increase of 11.6%, while the naval vessel business area registers a 16.2% growth, excluding pass-through activities. They respectively account for 58% and 22% of the Group s revenues and they are in line Q1 2020 results. Cruise ship business area revenues confirm the path already set in the fourth quarter 2020, with production back in full swing in all the Group s shipyards. 2021 production schedule for the Italian shipyards envisages the delivery of five units, of which one, Viking Venus, already delivered on April 15, three units to be delivered in Q3 and one unit in Q4. Vard Cruise s lower production volumes for the quarter, compared to March 31, 2020, affect the revenue trend of the business unit, with two luxury-niche units to be delivered in 2021, instead of the three delivered in 2020. The surge in production value for the naval business area, excluding pass-through activities related to the FREMM unit delivered in April, is driven the progress of the renewal program of the Italian Navy s fleet, whose first unit Vulcano was delivered last March. The increase in revenues is attributable as well to the progress in the program for the Qatari Ministry of Defence, with the first delivery scheduled for the second semester of the year, and for other orders acquired by Fincantieri (two submarine units U212NFS for the Italian Navy and four forward-sections as part of the Flotte Logistique program for the French Navy). Moreover, the business area records the contribution of the US subsidiary FMG, with the progress achieved in the LCS program and in the Foreign Military Sales program between the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The subsidiary, prime contractor in the FFG-62 program (previously known as FFG(X)) for the US Navy, has launched the design phase of the first-in-class unit. The segment s EBITDA, at euro 100 million as of March 31, 2021, has improved compared to the 2020 first quarter (euro 72 million), confirming the growth strategy and the guidelines outlined by the Group before the pandemic. EBITDA margin standsat 7.8%, excluding pass-through activities (6.7% considering total revenues), up from Q1 2020 EBITDA margin of 6.3%, proving that the levels of marginality embedded in the current backlog are within reach. Offshore and Specialized Vessels 31.12.2020 (euro/million) 31.03.2021 31.03.2020 389 Revenue and income (*) 96 126 (5) EBITDA (*) (**) 2 (1) -1.3% EBITDA margin (*) (***) 1.6% -0.8% (*) Before elimination between operating segments (**)This figure does not include extraordinary and non-recurrent income and expenses; please, refer to the paragraph Alternative Performance Measures (***) Ratio between segment EBITDA and Revenue and income Offshore and Specialized Vessels revenuesat March 31, 2021, are equal to euro 96 million, down by 23.5% compared to the same period of 2020. Such trend reflects, on one side, the decrease in volumes led by the downsizing of production capacity with the shutdown of the Brevik shipyard, still active in the first quarter of 2020, and, on the other side, by the redefinition of the product portfolio and of the backlog, in view of the repositioning into more promising sectors such as the offshore wind energy one. Such strategy shows little evidence on the results of the quarter. During 2020 and in the first months of this year, Vard has succeeded in becoming a reference player in the renewable energy sector as well as in the high-tech specialized vessels one. Confirmation of such repositioning is to be found in the order received for 3 SOVs (service operation vessel), which will be employed for the maintenance of the world s largest offshore wind farm, Dogger Bank, located off the North-East coast of England, in the North Sea. The segment s EBITDA as of March 31, 2021 is positive at euro 2 million (negative at euro 1 million at March 31, 2020), with an EBITDA margin at 1.6% (-0.8% at March 31, 2020). Q1 EBITDA benefits from the effects of the restructuring and reorganization plan launched in 2019 and it carries the first signs of the repositioning strategy in sectors with wider market opportunities.

The increase is mainly attributable to the Complete accommodation business area, driven by the cruise volumes developed during the period. Moreover, the segment s business areas are ramping up production activities of their backlog while strengthening their own positioning in the respective markets. The sector s EBITDA at March 31, 2021, stands at euro 10 million (euro 12 million at March 31, 2020), with an EBITDA margin at 4.5% (6.0% at March 31, 2020). Q1 marginality reflects the different combination of products and services offered in the period, while being affected by a lower contribution of the Ship Repair and Conversion business area in the quarter.

Net working capital is positive for euro 328 million (negative for euro 202 million at December 31, 2020). The main change refers to the increase in Construction contracts and clients advances (euro 812 million), attributable in particular to the progress of the cruise ship building program with 7 deliveries scheduled for the year, of which one already delivered in April. Construction loans, dedicated credit instruments used for the exclusive financing of the projects to which they are referred to, stand at euro 1,506 million, up by euro 181 million compared to December 31, 2020. Of these, euro 1,100 million are related to the Parent Company and euro 406 million to the subsidiary VARD. Net financial position[11] reports a net debt balance at euro 1,617 (euro 1,062 million in net debt at December 31, 2020). The change, in line with forecasts, is consistent with the developed production volumes and with delivery schedule, which envisages seven cruise ships to be delivered in the remaining part of the year (of which the first one delivered in April and three expected in Q3). It should be noted that the Net financial position is affected by the strategy of the deferrals granted to the clients, in order to preserve the sizeable backlog as well as to strengthen the relationships with them.

For this reason, the cruise unit, Coral Geographer, built by an offshore shipyard for Australian company Coral Expeditions, has been included among Offshore and Specialized Vessels deliveries BUSINESS OUTLOOK In view of the completion of the ongoing vaccination campaign, by virtue of the health and safety protocols put in place in all Group s shipyards and production sites and in the absence of negative developments due to the pandemic with unforeseeable repercussions, Fincantieri expects to keep production in full swing, as in the second half of 2020, allowing the Group to go back to pre-pandemic growth levels. With regard to the cruise market, while in the United States the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated mid-July as a potential starting point for the resumption of activities, some shipowners, whose routes are not affected by US directives, have already resumed or are about to resume navigation. For instance, Costa Smeralda of Costa Crociere started its Mediterranean Sea operations earlier this month. Despite the crisis triggered by the COVID-19 outbreak, the Group is going back to its growth path, thanks to a sizeable and diversified backlog, that it has been able to fully preserve (in particular in the cruise business area) also thanks to the strategy to support shipowners. Q1 2021 performance allows to confirm the 2021 guidance, with revenues up by 25-30% when compared to the 2020 (excluding pass-through activities) and EBITDA margin levels close to 7%. Net financial position is expected to increase during the first half of 2021, consistently with the cruise shipbuilding business specific financial dynamics and with the reassessed delivery schedule, which includes 7 cruise units, of which 4 scheduled for the second half of the year. Consistently with the deliveries timeline, the net financial position will tend to settle, at the end of 2021, to a value in line with the 2020 one, including the full CapEx plan scheduled for the year.

24 MARCH 2021,ENEL X AND FINCANTIERI COMMIT TO THE ENERGY TRANSITION FOR MARITIME TRANSPORT IN ITALY,"Rome, March 24th, 2021 Enel X and Fincantieri have signed a letter of intent to work together on building and running next-generation port infrastructure with a low environmental impact and developing electricity-powered solutions for ground logistics services. In its first stage dedicated to projects with a national scope, the agreement specifically pertains to: cold ironing, which refers to providing a shoreside power source to docked ships; management and optimization of energy exchanges in new infrastructure; electricity storage and production systems that use renewable sources and fuel cells. The partnership will also ensure that initiatives rolled out in Italy can be replicated in other countries, such as Spain, Portugal and Greece. The letter of intent might be subject to future binding agreements that the parties will define in compliance with the applicable normative and regulatory profiles, including those relating to transactions between related parties. The collaboration between Enel X, Enel's global business line, and Fincantieri, one of the world's largest ship builders, will energize the implementation of electricity-based solutions and decarbonization at ports. A growing number of ports and docks in Italy, and subsequently in other European countries, will offer cold ironing. This initiative will lead to the creation of a far-reaching European cold ironing network. Maritime transport accounts for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions. It is estimated that CO2 emissions from the maritime sector amount to 940 million tons every year, or 2.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Enel and Fincantieri are joining forces to promote the decarbonization of powering docked ships,"" said Eliano Russo, Head of e-Industries at Enel X. Ninety per cent of Europe's ports are located in metropolitan areas, and public opinion in many cities has decried the pollution, noise and vibrations caused by the engines of docked ships. Development of cold ironing infrastructure will prevent this, as docked ships will have an electrical connection onshore. Today, digitalization, sustainability and innovation allow us to offer smart, efficient technologies that will reboot Europe's port and maritime sectors"". Laura Luigia Martini, CEO Business Advisor and Executive Vice President of Corporate Business Development for Fincantieri noted: Developing smart, integrated infrastructures and safeguarding the region would catapult the national port system to a new level characterized by sustainability principles. Through the agreements with Enel X, we will make our skill set available to a highly innovative program, laying the foundation for an authentically digital and green transition that will reverberate throughout Italy's maritime economy, and beyond .",https://www.fincantieri.com/en/media/press-releases/2021/enel-x-and-fincantieri-commit-to-the-energy-transition-for-maritime-transport-in-italy/,https://www.fincantieri.com/globalassets/common/header/logo_new.png,Fincantieri
18 MARCH 2021,FINCANTIERI: DISCOVERY PRINCESS FLOATS OUT IN MONFALCONE,"Trieste, March 18, 2021 Discovery Princess, the sixth Royal-class ship built for the ship operator Princess Cruises, a brand within Carnival Corporation, floated out today at Fincantieri s shipyard in Monfalcone. Interior fittings will now begin, leading the vessel to delivery, scheduled next year. The new unit, at 145,000 gross tons, is built on the basis of the successful sister vessel project of Royal Princess, Regal Princess, Majestic Princess, Sky Princess and Enchanted Princess, built and delivered in the same shipyard starting from 2013, introducing a new generation of ships so well-received by the cruise passengers.

18 FEBRUARY 2021,VARD CONFIRMS ITS LEADERSHIP IN THE SPECIALIZED VESSELS SEGMENT,"Trieste, February 18, 2021 Vard, one of the major global shipbuilders of specialized vessels, will design a cable repair vessel for the French company Orange Marine, leader in undersea telecommunications, which has selected the Fincantieri subsidiary project. The vessel will be built at the Colombo Dockyard, Sri Lanka's largest shipbuildng group, based on the Vard 9 03 design. The references provided by the two companies were key to the acquisition of the order. Thus, the Vard Brattvaag shipyard has already delivered in 2014 the offshore support vessel Pierre de Fermat to Orange Marine, based on the 9 01 design, a state-of-the-art unit in terms of environmental sustainability and equipment. On the other hand, in 2019 Colombo has built the cable-laying vessel KDDI Cable Infinity for the Japanese company Kokusai Cable Ship, also based on the same Vard platform. The 9 03 design for Orange Marine has been specially designed for the maintenance of submarine cables, both fibre-optic telecommunication cables and power cables used in offshore windfarms. Vard has developed the vessel design according to the clients operating requirements with special attention to the vessel hull design in terms of good sea-keeping capabilities, maneuverability, and low fuel consumption. Vard is continuously expanding its portfolio for power and telecom cable laying and repair vessels, developing in-house competence and experience within this segment, working with significant companies in the industry, and positioning itself as one of the most experienced ship designers of such kind of vessels. Currently, the company has two cable laying vessels under construction, the 9 04 project for Prysmian, and the one related to the recently signed contract for Van Oord.",https://www.fincantieri.com/en/media/press-releases/2021/vard-confirms-its-leadership-in-the-specialized-vessels-segment/,https://www.fincantieri.com/globalassets/common/header/logo_new.png,Fincantieri

11 FEBRUARY 2021,NAVIRIS AND NAVANTIA SIGN A MOU FOR THE EUROPEAN PATROL CORVETTE PROGRAM,"Genoa/Madrid, February 11, 2021 NAVIRIS, the 50/50 joint venture company between Fincantieri and Naval Group in charge of development of cooperation programs, and NAVANTIA have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) aimed at enlarging the industrial cooperation for the European Patrol Corvette (EPC) program, the most important naval initiative within the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) project. The EPC will be a smart, innovative, affordable, sustainable, interoperable and flexible vessel to meet the future missions in the evolved world context of mid-21st century. EPC will be a fully ready surface combatant to carry-out diversified missions, primarily aimed at enhancing maritime situational awareness, surface superiority and power projection, particularly in the context of governmental peacetime actions, such as those aimed at counteracting piracy and smuggling, as well as those actions dedicated to humanitarian assistance, migration control and aimed at ensuring freedom of navigation. It will be about 100 meters and 3.000 tons, able to replace in the near future (from 2027 onward) several classes of ships, from patrol vessels to light frigates. The design requirements for these vessels, with a clear objective of commonality of solutions and modularity for adaptation to national requirements, are expected from the Navies in 2021. On the industrial side, NAVIRIS and NAVANTIA will act in a fully coordinated way with Fincantieri and Naval Group for the EPC program. The studies could potentially benefit from European Union and national funds and will include a large part of R&D leading to innovative solutions for making easier the co-development and interoperability, the efficiency of the vessels in operations and the digital data management. The ambition of the project, which has been joined so far by four Countries at PESCO level, (Italy as coordinator, France, Spain and Greece), is to include other European partners to integrate technological bricks, which correspond to innovation streams matching with national EPC requirements and European Commission strategy and guidelines.",https://www.fincantieri.com/en/media/press-releases/2021/naviris-and-navantia-sign-a-mou-for-the-european-patrol-corvette-program/,https://www.fincantieri.com/globalassets/common/header/logo_new.png,Fincantieri

The fitting out phase will now begin during which Fincantieri s skilled craftspeople will bring the ship s elegant interiors to life. Silver Dawn will become the 10th ship in the leading ultra-luxury cruise line s fleet. With the delivery of both Silver Origin and Silver Moon in 2020, and with the delivery of Silver Dawn scheduled for November 2021, Silversea Cruises and the global cruise industry in general continues to demonstrate great resilience. We proudly celebrate this major milestone in the build of our beautiful new Silver Dawn says Roberto Martinoli, President and CEO of Silversea Cruises. Our long-term collaboration with Fincantieri continues to push boundaries in the ultra-luxury cruise industry, while the ongoing support and expertise of the Royal Caribbean Group has been invaluable to the ship s build. While Silver Dawn takes influence from our beloved ships Silver Muse and Silver Moon, our guests will benefit from many pioneering enhancements aboard the tenth ship in our fleet. We look forward to revealing these in the coming months . Luigi Matarazzo, General Manager Merchant Ships Division of Fincantieri, stated: Based on the very successful design of Silver Muse, Silver Dawn is the fourth ship we will have built for Silversea. For a shipbuilder there can be no better acknowledgement than the one of a demanding and prestigious owner who welcomes innovation with enthusiasm. We are therefore extremely proud to celebrate the launch of this ship. She consolidates the technological and management leadership of our Group which takes on even greater value in the very challenging situation we are experiencing . The third ship in the Muse-class series, and part of a long-term plan to grow and enhance the cruise line s already luxurious fleet, Silver Dawn will be a sistership to Silversea s Silver Muse, built in the Fincantieri shipyard of Sestri Ponente (Genoa) in April 2017, and Silver Moon, which was delivered in Ancona in October 2020. Accommodating just 596 guests in 298 ocean-view suites 96% of which will have a private veranda and with a crew-to-guest ratio of 1:1.45, Silver Dawn will maintain the small-ship intimacy and spacious accommodation which are the hallmarks of the Silversea experience. She will offer guests many exciting enhancements when compared to Silver Muse and Silver Moon, which will be unveiled in due course. Providing superlative comfort and an enhanced onboard experience, she will unlock authentic travel experiences for Silversea s discerning guests in the world s most spectacular destinations.
