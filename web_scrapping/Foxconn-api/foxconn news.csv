0,2021/11/11,"Foxconn and Lordstown Motors Enter Into a Transformative, Strategic Partnership","Lordstown Motors Corp. (“Lordstown Motors” or “LMC”) (Nasdaq: RIDE), a provider of electric light-duty trucks focused on the commercial fleet market, and Hon Hai Technology Group (“Foxconn”) (TWSE: 2317), one of the largest electronics manufacturers in the world, today announced that they have entered into a definitive Asset Purchase Agreement regarding LMC’s facility in Lordstown, Ohio. As previously disclosed, on September 30th Lordstown Motors entered into an Agreement in Principle, or AIP, with an affiliate of Hon Hai Precision Industries, also known as Foxconn, to work jointly on Lordstown Motors’ electric vehicle programs in the production and assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. Shortly after the AIP, and as a sign of confidence in the partnership, Foxconn purchased $50 million of common stock directly from Lordstown Motors at a price of $6.8983 per share. The definitive Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”) implements the terms of the AIP and provides as follows: LMC has agreed to sell to Foxconn the Lordstown facility, excluding certain assets such as the hub motor assembly line and battery module and pack lines, for $230 million. Foxconn has agreed to make a down payment of the purchase price of $100 million by November 18th, and subsequent down payments of $50 million on each of February 1st, 2022 and no later than April 15, 2022. The balance of the purchase price will be paid at closing. The parties have agreed to pursue a contract manufacturing agreement for the Endurance pickup truck, which must be entered into before closing—currently targeted by April 30th.  Lordstown Motors and Foxconn will pursue a joint venture agreement to co-design and develop vehicle programs for the global commercial fleet market, using the MIH open platform. Lordstown and Foxconn would have the right to commercialize these new EV programs in North America and internationally. Upon the closing, Foxconn will receive 1.7 million warrants to acquire Lordstown common stock, exercisable for three years, at a price of $10.50 per share. The closing of the transactions contemplated by the APA is subject to closing conditions, including entry into the contract manufacturing agreement, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.   Young Liu, Chairman of Hon Hai Technology Group, commented “This partnership marks the commencement of integrating our resources with Lordstown Motors to develop Ohio into Hon Hai’s most important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&D hub in North America. As we look to inject Hon Hai’s software and hardware capabilities in the information and communications industry with the wealth of automotive experience that resides in this town and our partners, we will be able to provide customers with more real-time and efficient Electric vehicle products.” Daniel Ninivaggi, Chief Executive Officer of Lordstown Motors Corp., stated, “We are happy to have formed a strategic partnership with a company as innovative and forward-thinking as Foxconn. I believe in their EV strategy and look forward to substantial collaboration in the future. In my view, this transaction provides LMC a better opportunity to fulfill its original mission of satisfying the growing demand for electric vehicles, particularly in the underserved commercial market, with a more flexible business model.”  The Foxconn partnership will unlock the tremendous potential of the Lordstown plant by getting it to scale faster. At 6.2 million square feet, and 640 acres, the Lordstown Complex was one of the largest internal combustion engine automotive plants in North America. It is now being converted into a state-of-the-art EV manufacturing facility. Foxconn has an excellent opportunity to fill the plant, having already announced that the Fisker PEAR program is intended to be manufactured in Lordstown.  Lordstown Motors and all OEMs whose vehicles are built at the plant will benefit from the increased capacity utilization, possible use of common components and shared overhead costs. The use of shared space and the MIH open platform provides smaller, more specialized OEM’s the opportunity to achieve the benefits of scale without being a large, fully integrated automaker. Finally, the partnership with Foxconn should enable Lordstown Motors to significantly reduce its raw material, component and other input costs. As one of the largest contract manufacturers globally, Foxconn will bring to bear the purchasing power, supply chain network, and logistics capabilities to significantly reduce vehicle production costs and mitigate supply chain risk. LMC also stands to benefit from Foxconn’s expertise in hardware software integration – critical to EVs – given their experience as a multinational electronics manufacturer.",https://www.foxconn.com/en-us/press-center/press-releases/latest-news/704,https://image.honhai.com/news/DSC05912.jpg

With the theme of ""Sustainable Strategy, Circular Economy and Zero Waste Management at Foxconn "", Ron Horng, Hon Hai Technology Group Vice President and Chief Environment Officer was invited to share about the best practices at Foxconn, with participants from the various industries worldwide. With the business formula “Sustainability=EPS+ESG” introduced by Hon Hai Technology Group Chairman & CEO Young Liu, the company has moved towards the United Nations SDGs (sustainable development goals) through various measures to achieve ""responsible production"". At the forum, the company shared their perspective on the circular economy and their plans to realize a green supply chain.  As a start, Foxconn has prioritized adapting lead-free and halogen-free manufacturing processes in their daily operation in the campuses—protecting their employees and reducing the impact on the environment. In recent years, more projects involving green chemicals have been initiated. Part of the process included a review of the chemicals used in the FATP (Final Assembly Line). This resulted in the company refreshing their list of forbidden chemicals and the introduction of green chemicals instead. At present, green chemicals are widely used in FATP lines across all campuses. This year’s focus will be on the components manufacturing lines, beginning with the identifying of chemical suppliers that would be able to provide a green cleaner and degreasing agent. Beyond a constant review of their internal operations, Foxconn also seeks external partnerships, working with industry organizations like IPC (the global association for electronics manufacturing) to develop industry guidelines for green chemicals. Together with other IPC partners over the past year, Foxconn was part of the group that developed a new IPC-1402 standard for green cleaners, that will debut early next year. The introduction of green chemical standards is an important step toward the sustainability of the electronics manufacturing industry. It not only guarantees the safety and health of workers in the supply chain, but also reduces the environmental impact during production. As a global technology company, Foxconn recognizes the need to give back to the industry and has participated in opportunities and platforms to share their experience on integrating green chemistry in manufacturing operations and supply chains. Some of the opportunities has included the company assisting leading international organizations like ChemFORWORD to build platforms for identifying and developing safer cleaning products. The goal of sharing their industry experience, is for the company to catalyze collaboration that would lead to the development of a more robust green manufacturing environment for the industry. To tackle zero waste, Foxconn Shenzhen Longhua Park launched the UL Turbo Waste management platform in January 2021. Through the data analysis, the system is able to track waste generation, material flow and conversion rate in real time. The data harnessed is further combined with waste reduction and recycling solutions to make continuous improvement.

69,2021/01/21,"Foxconn Announces FOXCONN NxVAE, Unsupervised Learning AI Technology","TAIPEI, 21 January 2021 - Foxconn Technology Group (Foxconn), a global leader in smart manufacturing, today announced the launch of FOXCONN NxVAE, a new unsupervised learning artificial intelligence (AI) technology that ensures higher levels of efficiency and accuracy in the inspection of defects in manufacturing production lines when compared with traditional practices.  As a first step in applying this new technology, Foxconn introduced FOXCONN NxVAE to some handheld device production lines in mainland China. After eight months of research and development, those lines successfully reduced the manpower resources required for defect inpsection by 50 percent. The new technology will also be applied to broader manufacturing uses for verticals such as textiles and healthcare, as part of Foxconn’s support for accelerating transformation of a range of industry sectors.  Figure: The automated production line applied for FOXCONN NxVAE. New technology transforming the production line defect inspection process Defect inspection during the production process is an important step to ensuring product quality. Traditionally, Computer Vision technology is used in defect inspection and that technology identifies defects by recognizing and defining a “Golden Sample” - a perfect product sample - and comparing each product with that sample. The “Golden Sample” comparison, however, varies when it is placed in different manufacturing locations. Slight changes, such as the difference of light sources and the positioning of the DUT, Device Under Test, sample, can result in a comparison failure and that is why there is a need for additional manpower for secondary detection. Supervised learning (deep learning) technology is being increasingly used to enhance the efficiency of this process. The machine learning algorithms are taught to distinguish defects through data labelling, training and inferencing. However, that requires the use of high resolution defect visuals for the machine learning process and that can be time consuming and hard to collect given the high-quality production standards within Foxconn.  FOXCONN NxVAE, with unsupervised learning AI at its core, addresses the above challenges and brings unprecedented benefits to smart manufacturing. The unsupervised learning algorithms in the new solutions can identify products with defects by simply analyzing and clustering unlabeled data from a good product sample without the need for human intervention. The technology, and its increased ability to discover differences in data received, ensures that the inspection process is significantly enhanced, and manual checking becomes unnecessary. Moreover, its self-learning ability does not require collecting, categorizing, and labelling each of the detect visuals thus allowing for a more significant buffer in the usually tight production timeline. FOXCONN NxVAE has the ability to detect the 13 most common types of defects accurately without any errors.  Continual investment and innovation of AI solutions  The vision at Foxconn is to pave the way for next-generation AI solutions. The company has deployed several in-house-developed AI solutions on a number of different production lines, leading to an improvement in reporting accuracy from 95% to 99% and a reduction of at least one third of the operating costs for appearance defect inspection projects. The company’s vision is also reflected in the recent launch of “BOXiedge™”, the next-generation AI processing solution for video analytics. That solution provides market-leading energy efficiency for standalone AI inference nodes, benefiting applications including smart cities, smart medical, and industrial IoT. In the future, FOXCONN NxVAE will also be applied and integrated into “BOXiedge™” solutions.  “The yield rate of our production lines has exceeded 99% and the unsupervised learning algorithm developed by the AI team not only enhances efficiency and reduces the challenges associated with introducing new products into the production line, it also marks an important production efficiency milestone for our industry,” said Gene Liu, Vice President of the Semiconductor Subgroup at Foxconn Technology Group. “This development also demonstrates our company’s vision of “3+3=∞” which symbolizes the infinite possibilities created by Foxconn’s industrial advancement and emerging technologies, and we remain committed to investing in these areas.”  For more information, please contact: Max Deng (max.cm.deng@foxconn.com).  FOXCONN NxVAE Product Information: https://nxai.com.tw/nxvae-unsupervised-learning-en/",https://www.foxconn.com/en-us/press-center/press-releases/latest-news/533,https://image.honhai.com/news/001_1611219900.jpg

We are confident that this product will enable endpoint devices to operate with better performance, lower power, more flexibility, and minimal latency.” Hailo’s specialized Hailo-8™ deep learning processor delivers unprecedented performance to edge devices. Featuring up to 26 Tera Operations Per Second (TOPS), the chip is built with an innovative architecture that enables edge devices to run sophisticated deep learning applications that could previously only run on the cloud. Its advanced structure translates into higher performance, lower power, and minimal latency, enabling enhanced privacy and better reliability for smart devices operating at the edge. “We are thrilled to announce our collaboration with two of the global leaders in AI solutions,” said Orr Danon, CEO and Co-Founder of Hailo. “Our deep learning processor significantly upgrades the capabilities of smart devices operating at the edge, and this collaboration will impact a wide range of industries increasingly driven by edge technology. A new generation of chips means a new generation of capabilities at the edge.”  The next generation of the BOXiedge AI computing solution is equipped with applications for a broader market relying on low latency, a high data rate, high reliability, and quick processing at the edge. Smart retail and smart cities, for instance, require hundreds of cameras - either in-store or in traffic monitoring - to generate video streams that need to be processed locally, quickly, and efficiently with minimal latency. Similarly, for industrial IoT, where every split-second counts, data acquiring, processing, inferencing, and presenting on the production floor rather than in the cloud translates into significant cost savings along with more efficient processing for tasks such as inspection and quality assurance.  About Foxconn Technology Group Established in 1974, Foxconn Technology Group (""Foxconn"") is a leading technological solution provider, that has leveraged its expertise in software and hardware to integrate its unique manufacturing systems with emerging technologies.

105,2019/09/06,Statement from Hon Hai Technology Group,"Foxconn employs a workforce in its operations in China that is comprised of a combination of full-time employees and dispatch workers.  In addition, in some locations, we have an established, short-term internship program that we carry out in cooperation with local governments and vocational schools.  In all cases and with all types of workers, we offer an industry-competitive salary and related benefits that significantly exceeds government-mandated levels. We work hard to comply with all relevant laws and regulations across all our operations.  We can confirm that a recent review of our operations at our facility in Zhengzhou did identify some workforce compliance issues. As soon as we received the results of that review, we immediately began a detailed process to ensure that all issues were addressed.  At no time did we find any evidence of forced labor and we can confirm that this facility currently has no interns working overtime. We did find evidence that the use of dispatch workers and the number of hours of overtime work carried out by employees, which we have confirmed was always voluntary, was not consistent with company guidelines. We did determine that the affected workers were paid all earned overtime and related bonus payments. Our work to address the issues identified in our Zhengzhou facility continues and we will closely monitor the situation. We will not hesitate to take any additional steps that might be required to meet the high standards we set for our operations.",https://www.foxconn.com/en-us/press-center/press-releases/latest-news/616,https://image.honhai.com/news/latest_news_1622700691.png
