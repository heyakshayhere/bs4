28 June 2022,DENEL MEDICAL BENEFIT TRUST UPDATE,"Dear Beneficiary YOUR MEDICAL AID SUBSIDY As you may know, the High Court ruled on 24 February 2022 that the Trust Deed of the Denel Medical Benefit Trust ( DMBT ) must be amended. The purpose of this communication is to provide you with an update of where the DMBT is in terms of implementing the Court Order. To refresh everyone s memory, the Court Order has three important implications, namely: Firstly, you may have elected that instead of receiving a medical aid subsidy from Denel which is paid by the DMBT, you will receive a regular payment from an insurer. This amount will be equal to 66.7% or 15% (depending on the Denel subsidy you are entitled to) of the Discovery Health Essential Comprehensive premium which comes into effect from 1 October 2022, plus 20% thereon. This total amount (hereafter called The Amount ) is guaranteed to increase by inflation plus 4% on each 1 January, with the first increase being effective on 1 January 2023. Y Secondly, if you elected not to accept the above settlement offer , or you did not submit a signed option form to Denel, the DMBT will continue to pay Denel s subsidy to Discovery Health on your behalf. As such, nothing will change for you. The Court Order makes provision that sufficient money must be left in the DMBT so that there is a very high chance that the DMBT will be able to meet Denel s medical aid subsidy obligation to you. Thirdly, the excess assets of the DMBT, over and above that required to provide for the two sets of beneficiaries described above, will be paid to Denel. However, this payment to Denel will only be made once the money needed to secure the above benefits has been settled in full to the insurer. The DMBT is in advanced negotiations with an Insurer to be the appointed insurer. It is essential that sufficient time be spent on this negotiation process as the DMBT Trustees must be comfortable that your interests are well looked after for many years still. At this time the DMBT Trustees believe that there is a very good chance that the policy terms and payment will be finalised by the end of July 2022, although we cannot provide any guarantee in this regard. If we assume that the above target date is met and the implementation date is 1 August 2022, then the following will happen next: If you have accepted Denel s offer: (a)the appointed Insurer will pay the current subsidy amount to Discovery Health on your behalf, so nothing changes in this regard. (b)The difference between The Amount and Denel s subsidy (that is the money in (a) above) will be invested by the Insurer in a portfolio that earns money market returns. This money belongs to you but will be paid out at a later date (see below). (c)the Insurer will take steps to issue an individual policy in your name. It is expected that this process will take about three months which should result in completion around about 1 November 2022. (d)At the same time as the Insurer issues the individual policy, they will pay you the amount it has accumulated on your behalf as per (b) above. However, you will need to pay income tax on this amount. (e)Once the individual policy is in place, the Insurer will pay Discovery Health that part of The Amount you elect, with the balance being paid to you. Note that any amount paid to you will be subject to income tax. You will receive a detailed statement showing what has been paid to Discovery Health and what amount will be paid to you together with the income tax thereon when the Insurer issues you with an individual policy. If you did not accept Denel s offer, your benefits remain the same and Denel s current medical aid subsidy will continue to be paid to Discovery Health. The DMBT Trustees thank you for your patience while getting the Court Order implemented. We are getting close now and we will issue an update note once the DMBT has finalised the policy terms and paid the consideration to the Insurer.

11 August 2021,Far-Reaching Steps To Ensure Denel's Sustainability,"A streamlined and refocused Denel will be able to be a sustainable business and return to profitability within the next five years. This will be done through a comprehensive restructuring of the defence technology company. We are determined to turn Denel around and repurpose it while retaining the core capabilities required to meet South Africa s strategic security requirements, says William Hlakoane, the company s interim Group Chief Executive. Furthermore, we are encouraged by the unwavering support that we have been receiving from our shareholder, the Department of Public Enterprises. This is underlined by its acknowledgement that there is a need to assist Denel with regards to its financial situation. Thus, I am positive that the discussions with other government departments that have keen interest in Denel s survival such as the Department of Defence and the National Treasury will soon bear positive results . For our part as executive management and the Board, we have put together a comprehensive five-year plan to revitalise Denel, which the shareholder is fully behind. Part of this plan includes reducing Denel s current operating divisions (plus one subsidiary) from six to two. One division will focus on engineering, while the other focuses on manufacturing and maintenance, of which the latter is our core business. The engineering division will merge all Denel s capabilities in artillery, infantry and vehicle systems, its missile and precision-guided munitions business as well as its management of complex integrated systems. Furthermore, it will drive the company s diversification of technology into existing and new markets in fields such as command and control, cyber security and communications, whilst researching and developing new technologies of the future. The maintenance and manufacturing division will build on Denel s market reputation in the fields of aeronautics, unmanned aerial vehicle systems and the production of small and medium calibre ammunition as well as the production of combat vehicles. Denel s campuses will be optimised to reduce their footprint and contain costs. This will be supplemented by further reductions in the executive cost structure, and the implementation of the shared services model in areas such as supply chain management, human capital, IT and finance. Hlakoane says conservative estimates indicate that the sale of non-core or non-profit making assets will realise value of about R1.5bn over the next five years. However, there is an immediate need for significant cash injections to support current operations and implement the new operating model. Although some of these activities are at an advance stage, we do acknowledge that it will take some time to sell these assets while the payment of legacy debt and the requirements for liquidity are immediate, says Hlakoane. It is imperative for Denel to continue executing programmes in order generate cash to pay salaries and other operational requirements whilst driving these strategic actions. Notwithstanding the much-needed critical skills that we have lost over the past year as we struggled with payment of employee s salaries, the priority will be to rebuild these skills sets over time while maintaining the current. Denel of the future will have to be globally competitive, therefore it is critical that we are able to attract the next generation of engineers, designers, scientists and technicians, he says. Denel s board and management are not oblivious to the plight of our colleagues who continue to face hardship as a result of our inability to pay full salaries and we continue to work tirelessly to address this issue. We apologise for the stress and anxieties caused to employees and again give the assurance that we will do everything in our power to meet our obligations in line with employee contracts.

27 May 2020,LOCAL VENTILATOR PROJECTS ARE REACHING CRITICAL STAGES,"Two projects to design and manufacture local ventilators to be used for the treatment of Covid-19 patients have reached critical stages. The design and layout phases have been completed and simulation exercises to test the efficacy of the projects will start soon. Project Sabela is coordinated by the defence and technology group, Denel, in partnership with other state-owned entities, research bodies and specialist companies in the private sector. Denel Dynamics, a global leader in the design and manufacturing of advanced missile and precision-guided weapon systems, has switched its focus to the production of medical ventilators to support patients who will be treated for the pandemic in public and private hospitals. In a parallel initiative Denel Land Systems, has joined forces with a leading university, engineering companies and a manufacturer of world-class domestic appliances to produce a full-function ventilator made from easy to source materials. Danie du Toit the Group CEO of Denel says considerable progress has been made in the design stage since Project Sabela was launched in early April. The aim of the project lead by Denel Dynamics is to design, develop and manufacture a low-cost, fit-for-purpose ventilator by utilising the skills and expertise of South African engineers, scientists, researchers, and technicians. We are optimistic about the potential to produce a low-cost, entry-level ventilator that can be used by the medical profession as the number of patients increase and the response levels are ramped up in the coming weeks, says Du Toit. The research team has evaluated a number of solutions proposed by companies across the world and eventually came up with its own design, a Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) device. The team has built a prototype BiPAP ventilator from available, off-the-shelf hardware following an extensive period of consultation with experts and reviews against applicable standards. This prototype is now undergoing further testing and evaluation from which the second design will be made that will meet the requisite criteria for medical ventilators and can be manufactured at scale within South Africa. Du Toit says Denel is proud to be associated with this local initiative and is committed to utilise the resources and expertise used to manufacture defence products towards a medical crisis which is spreading across the world. Denel Land Systems is part of a team led by Cambridge University s Whittle Laboratory, Cambridge Aerothermal, Beko PLC, Prodrive UK and Defy Appliances to develop a low-cost ventilator the OVSI that can be used by patients requiring ventilation at field hospitals, during transport, in normal hospitals and intensive care units. Other companies in the Denel group are also contributing towards the national response to the pandemic during the lockdown stages. Denel Aeronautics is providing valuable technical support to the helicopter fleet of the South African Air Force which has been deployed in all nine provinces. The Oryx transport helicopters carry critical medical and humanitarian supplies to communities on a daily basis and also conduct surveillance operations. Denel Aeronautics has already carried out critical repair work on the main gearboxes of two Oryx helicopters and the technical support teams are on standby around-the-clock to do maintenance, repairs and testing of equipment. Similar technical support has been provided to the C-130 transport aircraft that are undergoing regular inspections, repairs and testing at Denel s maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) facility at the Air Force Base Waterkloof.

25 April 2020,DENEL EMPLOYEES RETURN SAFELY FROM SPAIN,"Denel is pleased to announce the safe return of four of its employees who have been working on a project based in Seville, Spain. The four landed this morning on board the SA Airways aircraft, SA2261, as part of a group of South Africans repatriated from Europe yesterday. They were contracted by Denel Aeronautics at the Airbus assembly plant in Seville, Spain, when the outbreak of the pandemic occurred. Denel Aeronautics had a contract with Airbus to deliver critical parts of the A400M airlifter. The parts are manufactured at the Denel Aeronautics campus in Kempton Park and then shipped to Seville for final assembly. Spain is one of the countries in Europe that has been hardest hit by the virus and the four could not immediately return because of the stringent travel restrictions imposed by both countries. Their stay had to be extended due to the lockdown in Spain and the cancellation of all flights to South Africa. The contract had been due to expire now in mid-April 2020. We want to thank the South African government, particularly the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO), for facilitating the repatriation process of South Africans abroad and ensuring the safe return of the four employees back home. After landing in Johannesburg this morning, they have been placed in quarantine as a precautionary measure before being reunited with their families.

9 April 2020,MESSAGE BY PRESIDENT CYRIL RAMAPHOSA ON COVID-19 PANDEMIC,"My Fellow South Africans, At midnight tonight, it will be exactly two weeks since our country entered into an unprecedented nation-wide lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus. During the course of these last two weeks, your lives have been severely disrupted, you have suffered great hardship and endured much uncertainty. We have closed our borders to the world, our children are not in school, businesses have closed their operations, many have lost their income, and our economy has ground to a halt. And yet, faced with such daunting challenges, you, the people of South Africa, have responded with remarkable patience and courage. You have respected the lockdown and largely observed the regulations. You have accepted the severe restrictions on your movement and many of the daily freedoms that we all take for granted. You have done so because you have understood the devastating effect that this disease will have on the health and well-being of all South Africans unless we take drastic measures. You have also understood that we must do everything in our power to prevent the massive loss of life that would occur if we did not act. For your cooperation, for your commitment and above all for your patience, I wish to thank you personally. I wish to thank you for reaffirming to each other and to the world that we South Africans are a people who come together and unite at moments of great crisis. Earlier today I had a most productive meeting with our Premiers about the work they are doing in provinces and districts to stop the spread of the virus. I also had a discussion with the leaders of all our political parties represented in Parliament, who collectively pledged their support for the efforts that are being made to combat the pandemic. Through this we are demonstrating that we are able to work together across party lines to confront a common threat. Since I announced the lockdown just over two weeks ago, the global coronavirus pandemic has worsened. Two weeks ago, there were 340,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the world. We now have over 1.5 million confirmed cases worldwide. Over 90,000 people across the world have died from this disease. The health systems of many countries have been overwhelmed. Even the most developed economies in the world have not had the means to treat the many thousands who have fallen ill. They have struggled to find the medical supplies and personnel necessary to deal with the pandemic. The devastating effect of this is that many people have died. The global evidence is overwhelming. It confirms that our decision to declare a national state of disaster and to institute a nation-wide lockdown was correct and it was timely. While it is too early to make a definitive analysis of the progression of the disease in South Africa, there is sufficient evidence to show that the lockdown is working. Since the lockdown came into effect, the rate at which new cases have been identified here in South Africa has slowed significantly. From 1,170 confirmed cases on the 27th of March, the number of confirmed cases today stands at 1,934. In the two weeks before the lockdown, the average daily increase in new cases was around 42%. Since the start of the lockdown, the average daily increase has been around 4%. While we recognise the need to expand testing to gain a better picture of the infection rate, this represents real progress. The measures we have taken such as closing our borders and prohibiting gatherings as well as the changes that we have each had to make in our own behaviour, have definitely slowed the spread of the virus. But the struggle against the coronavirus is far from over. We are only at the beginning of a monumental struggle that demands our every resource and our every effort. We cannot relax. We cannot be complacent. In the coming weeks and months, we must massively increase the extent of our response and expand the reach of our interventions. We are learning both from the experiences of other countries and from the evidence we now have about the development of the pandemic in South Africa. Both make a clear and compelling case to proceed in a manner that is cautious and properly calibrated. Simply put, if we end the lockdown too soon or too abruptly, we risk a massive and uncontrollable resurgence of the disease. We risk reversing the gains we have made over the last few weeks, and rendering meaningless the great sacrifices we have all made. Fellow South Africans, This evening, I stand before you to ask you to endure even longer. I have to ask you to make even greater sacrifices so that our country may survive this crisis and so that tens of thousands of lives may be saved. After careful consideration of the available evidence, the National Coronavirus Command Council has decided to extend the nation-wide lockdown by a further two weeks beyond the initial 21 days. This means that most of the existing lockdown measures will remain in force until the end of April. We will use the coming days to evaluate how we will embark on risk-adjusted measures that can enable a phased recovery of the economy, allowing the return to operation of certain sectors under strictly controlled conditions. We will also use this time to ramp up our public health interventions. We did not take this decision to extend the lockdown lightly. As your President, I am mindful of the great and heavy burden this will impose on you. I am keenly aware of the impact this will have on our economy. But I know, as you do, that unless we take these difficult measures now, unless we hold to this course for a little longer, the coronavirus pandemic will engulf, and ultimately consume, our country. We all want the economy to come back to life, we want people to return to work, we want our children to go back to school, and we all want to be able to move freely again. But our immediate priority must remain to slow down the spread of the virus and to prevent a massive loss of life. We must do this while preventing our economy from collapsing and saving our people from hunger. We are determined to pursue a path that both saves lives and protects livelihoods. Our strategy is made up of three parts: - Firstly, an intensified public health response to slow down and reduce infections. - Secondly, a comprehensive package of economic support measures to assist businesses and individuals affected by the pandemic. - Thirdly, a programme of increased social support to protect poor and vulnerable households. As government, together with our many partners, we have used this lockdown period to both refine and intensify our public health strategy to manage the coronavirus. Our approach is to screen in communities and test people in hospitals, clinics and mobile clinics, to isolate those who are infected, and to care for those who are ill in our health facilities. We need to do this intensively and systematically. We have used the last week to develop our screening and testing methodology in various parts of the country. Over the next two weeks, we will roll out the community screening and testing programme across all provinces, focusing in particular on highly vulnerable communities. Those who test positive and cannot self-isolate at home will be isolated at special facilities that have been identified and are now being equipped. At all times, we will observe the human rights of all people. Let us not discriminate against people who test positive. To ensure that our strategies are effectively coordinated and to ensure they are informed by comprehensive, real-time data, we have established the COVID-19 Information Centre at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. This world-class centre will keep track of all screening, testing, isolation and hospitalisation throughout the country. It is already identifying infection hotspots. It is following the spread and the severity of the disease, and enabling us to move our focus and resources where they are most needed. We are working with mobile telephony companies and other institutions to locate those people who have tested positive for the virus and those with whom they have been in contact. As part of the second element of our strategy, we have put in place various measures to provide support to businesses in distress, to workers facing loss of income, to the self-employed and to informal businesses. Many of these measures are being taken up by both large and small businesses. The Unemployment Insurance Fund has set aside R40 billion to help employees who will be unable to work, as part of the effort to prevent jobs losses as a result of the lockdown. To date, it has paid out R356 million. I would like to applaud all those employers who have continued to pay their workers during this difficult time, as well as those employers who are working with unions and government to assist their employees to access these benefits. I would like to call on all businesses to continue to pay their suppliers, to the extent that they can, to ensure that those suppliers can also continue to operate and pay their staff and suppliers. In this respect, I would like to appeal to all large businesses not to resort to force majeure and stop paying their suppliers and rental commitments, as such practice has a domino effect on all other businesses dependent on that chain. We must do all we can to ensure that the underlying economy continues to function and to focus support on those small businesses that really need them. The Industrial Development Corporation has set aside R3 billion for the procurement of essential medical supplies. It has already approved R130 million in funding and expects to approve a further R400 million in the coming week to companies who applied for funding under this special facility. The Small Enterprise Finance Agency has approved the postponement of loan repayments for a period of 6 months. The small business debt relief and business growth facilities are currently adjudicating applications for assistance. There is a total of R500 million available in support. Government has reprioritised R1.2 billion to provide relief to smallholder farmers and to contribute to the security of food supply. In addition to these expenditure measures, the Reserve Bank has also lowered interest rates and has taken measures to inject liquidity into the economy. One of the biggest challenges that all countries in the world are facing is the shortage of medical supplies to fight the coronavirus. As a country we have had to rely on our own capabilities to supply these goods, but have also had to source supplies from other countries. In recent weeks, we have seen a massive mobilisation of South African business, labour, academics and government agencies to build the stocks of medical and other equipment needed to fight coronavirus. We have, for example, established the National Ventilator Project to rapidly mobilise the technical and industrial resources of our country to manufacture non-invasive ventilators, which can be used to support patients afflicted with the disease. Other projects are focusing on increasing the local manufacture of protective face masks, hand sanitisers and pharmaceutical products which can be used by health care workers and the public at large. As the third part of our coronavirus response, we have been working to provide basic needs such as water and to maintain the reliability of food supply to the poorest South Africans. We have also expanded the provision of food parcels and weve provided spaza shops with financial support. To date, government has delivered over 11,000 water storage tanks to communities in need across the country, and many of these have been installed. In addition, 1,000 water tankers have been provided for the delivery of water. Several homeless people have been accommodated in 154 shelters. I am pleased to report that the Solidarity Fund which was established to mobilise resources from companies, organisations and individuals to combat the coronavirus pandemic has so far raised around R2.2 billion. It has already allocated around R1 billion to buy sterile gloves, face shields, surgical masks, test kits and ventilators. It will also allocate funds for humanitarian relief to vulnerable households, in addition to the R400 million set aside by government for Social Relief of Distress grants. All of these efforts, while necessary and commendable, will not be sufficient on their own to cushion the poor from the impact of this pandemic. Nor will they provide the relief that businesses and their employees require. Additional extraordinary measures will need to be put in place in the coming weeks and months to absorb the sudden loss of income to both businesses and individuals. We are in a situation that demands swift action and exceptional methods, a situation that demands innovation and the mobilisation of every resource that we have. Cabinet will be developing a comprehensive package of urgent economic measures to respond both to the immediate crisis and to the severe economic challenges that we must confront in the months ahead. Further announcements on the next phase of our economic and social support strategy will be made in due course. An essential part of our response to this emergency is the principle of solidarity. From across society, companies and individuals have come forward to provide financial and other assistance. In support of this effort, we have decided that the President, Deputy President, Ministers and Deputy Ministers will each take a one-third cut in their salaries for the next three months. This portion of their salaries will be donated to the Solidarity Fund. We are calling on other public office bearers and executives of large companies to make a similar gesture and to further increase the reach of this national effort. In this regard, we welcome the donation of 20,000 cellphones by Vodacom for health workers that will be involved in screening and tracing in communities. As we have stressed before and we will stress once again, our struggle against the coronavirus requires fundamental changes in behaviour from all of us. Until we have contained the coronavirus, the same rules remain. Shaking hands, hugging, sitting close to each other and other forms of physical contact enable this virus to be transmitted, and must be avoided. We must continue to wash our hands regularly and thoroughly using water and soap or sanitiser. To stay safe and to keep others safe we must continue to respect whatever restrictions that are placed on our movement and on our daily lives Over the past two weeks, I have been speaking to other African leaders about a coordinated continental effort to combat the coronavirus and support our people and our economies. We have established an AU COVID-19 Response Fund to mobilise the resources necessary to support this effort. We have reached out to world leaders, even as they struggle with the pandemic in their countries, to assist the continent with essential medical supplies and to support a comprehensive stimulus package for Africa. As we confront this disease in our country, we are part of a great global effort that is bringing humanity together in ways that many never thought possible. For billions across the world, and for us here in South Africa, the coronavirus pandemic has changed everything. We can no longer work in the way we have before. As government, as NGOs, as political parties, as large corporations and small businesses, as financial institutions, as community organisations and as South Africans we will need to adapt to a new reality. As we emerge from this crisis, our country will need to undergo a process of fundamental reconstruction. To do so, we will draw on our strengths: our abundant natural resources, our advanced infrastructure, our deep financial markets, our proven capabilities in information and communication technology, and the depth of talent among our people. We will draw on our proven capacity for innovation and creativity, our ability to come together in a crisis, and our commitment to each other and our common future. We will learn from global experience and the best scientific evidence, but we will craft a uniquely South African response that uses our own capabilities as a nation. This weekend is a sacred time for many South Africans. For many, it will be difficult to spend this time without their friends and family. I ask that you keep in your thoughts tonight all in our land who are vulnerable, destitute and alone. I ask that you give what you can to alleviate their burden. To contribute to the Solidarity Fund in any way you can. This is a difficult time for us all. Yet the message of Easter is one we carry in our hearts tonight. It is the message of hope, of recovery and of rebirth. As we walk this road together, as we struggle to defeat this pandemic, we remain strong and united and resolved. Much is being asked of you, far more than should ever be asked. But we know that this is a matter of survival, and we dare not fail. We shall recover. We shall overcome. May God bless South Africa and protect her people. I thank you.
