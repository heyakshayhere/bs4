PPL holds 27.78% equity stake in the company as a result of this investment. As PPS continues  to strengthen its capabilities and position itself as a leading CDMO, this acquisition marks a significant  addition to PPS’ global capabilities in the development and manufacturing of large molecules for  human clinical trials.    Yapan Bio provides process development, scale-up, and cGMP compliant manufacturing of vaccines  and biologics/bio-therapeutics, including high containment product classes (up to BSL-2+),  recombinant vaccines, RNA/DNA vaccines, gene therapies, monoclonal antibodies, therapeutic  proteins, and other complex biologics. Yapan’s FY21 turnover was INR 12.4cr. The company has  already earned revenues of INR 11.8cr for H1FY22 and is poised for fast growth in response to strong  market demand.

This investment further supports our growth strategy for Piramal Pharma.”    Peter DeYoung, CEO, Pharma Solutions, Piramal Pharma Limited said, “During the past decade,  biologics and their accompanying development services are the fastest growing segments of the  CDMO market. This investment, coupled with the market-leading capabilities of our Grangemouth, UK  site in antibody drug conjugations and our sterile fill/finish capabilities in Lexington, USA,  demonstrates our commitment to growing our service offerings in the large molecule CDMO space.”    Atin Tomar and Nirav Desai, CEO and COO of Yapan said, “We are very excited about this transaction  and are confident that PPS is the ideal partner to take the business through its next phase of growth.  Yapan’s employees and customers, who are the core stakeholders of our business, will most assuredly  benefit from PPS’ expertise in providing integrated services on a global scale.”    In today’s market, many pharma innovator companies are looking for CDMOs to support their  biologics development and manufacturing requirements.

Page 1 of 5  Mr. Ajay Piramal, Chairman, Piramal Group, said, “Over the years, Piramal Enterprises has grown multi-fold with  diverse businesses under one listed holding company structure. In line with our stated strategy, the Board has today  approved the demerger and simplification of our corporate structure, to create two independent listed entities in  Financial Services and Pharmaceuticals, with a leadership position across the business segments they operate in. It will  firmly empower both entities to be future-ready and enable them to independently pursue their growth strategies  with sharper focus and identity.    Piramal Enterprises Limited will get transformed into a large listed diversified NBFC, focused on retail and wholesale  financing, with a consolidated loan book of ~INR 65,000 Crores. Our retail lending platform will be digitally-led, that  will serve the financing needs of the under-served customers in the ‘Bharat’ market. With the recent acquisition of  DHFL, the wholly-owned housing finance housing subsidiary has been significantly scaled to become one of the largest  HFCs of our country, focused on affordable housing finance.    Piramal Pharma Limited will be a large India-listed pharma company with proven capabilities in Contract Development  & Manufacturing, global distribution of complex hospital generics, and a large geographic footprint in the consumer  products market in India. PPL’s Contract Development and Manufacturing (CDMO) business is one of the top three in  India and the 13th largest globally. PPL’s Complex Hospital Generics and India Consumer Healthcare businesses are  well positioned with differentiated products and business models.    Going forward, in line with our philosophy of ‘Doing Well and Doing Good’, both the listed entities will continue to  work towards creating value for all our stakeholders.”    About the Demerger and Simplification of the Corporate Structure:    Pharma:  The pharmaceuticals business will get demerged from Piramal Enterprises Limited and consolidated in Piramal Pharma  Limited (PPL). Hemmo Pharma Private Limited (focused on peptide APIs development and manufacturing capabilities)  and Convergence Chemical Private Limited (setup for development, manufacturing and selling speciality  fluorochemicals), will get amalgamated with PPL to create a consolidated listed Pharma entity.    In consideration of the demerger, PPL shall issue 4 (four) fully paid-up equity shares of PPL of Rs. 10 each to the  shareholders of PEL for every 1 (one) fully paid-up equity share in PEL having a face value of Rs. 2 each held by them,  in accordance with the Share Entitlement Ratio.    Financial Services:  The amalgamation of PHL Fininvest Private Limited with PEL will create a listed Non-banking Financial Services (NBFC)  entity. The merged Housing Finance company, (HFC) post DHFL acquisition, will remain a 100% subsidiary of PEL.    Through this demerger and simplification of the corporate structure, the shareholders of PEL will directly own shares  in both the listed entities, without any cross-holdings and minority stakes.    The composite Scheme of Arrangement is subject to the approval of the shareholders and creditors of the companies,  the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.  (NSE), Bombay Stock Exchange Ltd (BSE) Limited, Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and other regulatory  authorities, as applicable.                                                                Page 2 of 5  Strategic Rationale:    The demerger and simplification of the corporate structure is expected to create synergies for both the companies  and unlock significant value for both the companies and stakeholders.        •   It will simplify the Piramal Enterprises’ corporate structure with two separate pure-play entities in          Pharmaceuticals and Financial Services.        •   It will further strengthen governance architecture for the businesses with separate dedicated Boards and          Management teams.        •   It will create an optimal capital structure for each business.        •   It will give both entities the ability to independently pursue growth plans organically and inorganically.        •   It will enable a better understanding of each sector-focused listed entity by the investor and analyst          community.    Outcome:    The demerger and simplification of the corporate structure will lead to the creation of separate sector-focused listed  entities in Financial Services and Pharmaceuticals.    Piramal Enterprises Limited      • Pursuant to the amalgamation, PEL will become one of the leading diversified NBFCs* in India. The company         offers a wide range of financial products and solutions across both retail and wholesale financing. Through its         digital-led multi-product retail lending platform, the company will provide home loans, small business loans,         loans for working capital to customers, used cars/two-wheeler loans, education loans, personal loans and loan         against securities.        •   PEL will continue to own 100% stake in the Housing Finance company (merged with DHFL) focused on          affordable housing finance. The HFC will address the diverse financing needs of the under-served ‘Bharat’          market through its India-wide platform across 24 states through 301 branches and a reach to ~1 million          customers.        •   The DHFL acquisition has enabled the transformation of the financial services business from a largely          wholesale led model to a well-diversified financial services player. The retail loan book has increased nearly          five-fold, paving the way to achieve a balanced retail-wholesale mix in the near term and 67:33 in the medium-          to-long term. The DHFL transaction will enhance capital efficiency (net debt-to-equity to increase from 1.6x as          in June 2021 to 3.5x in the near term).        •   Within wholesale lending, the company continues to provide financing to real estate developers, as well as          corporate clients.        •   Over the last two years, the company has significantly strengthened the balance sheet and reduced its debt-          to-equity, thereby creating a headroom for growth in coming years.                                                               Page 3 of 5       •    PEL has also formed strategic partnerships with leading financial institutions such as CPPIB, APG and Ivanhoe            Cambridge, and others, across various investment platforms.

To address the current emergency due to the second wave of  Covid-19, the Foundation, will set up 100 Covid Care Centres in rural and tribal blocks across 25 of the  worst affected Aspirational districts, and Home Care Support to the tribal and rural population with  poor access to health services in 112 Aspirational districts across India in partnership with Niti Aayog.  Piramal Foundation will invest INR 100 crores towards COVID Relief in the Aspirational Districts, in  Partnership with Niti Aayog.    The intervention seeks to reach 2 million people in 1143 blocks through a network of 1000+ NGOs and  over 1 lac volunteers. In Maharashtra alone, it aims to reach 1.25 lakh people in 32 blocks of 4  Aspirational Districts of Gadchiroli, Nandurbar, Osmanabad and Washim.    In Maharashtra, the 4 Aspirational Districts have been among the worst hit. These districts account  for 1.6 lakh cases and close to 3063fatalities. The number is growing alarmingly by the day, with almost  3.3 per cent of the deaths in Maharashtra happening in these aspirational districts.    Dr. Swati Piramal, Public Health Expert and Vice-Chairperson Piramal Enterprises Limited said, ""As  the pandemic spreads rapidly from urban areas to the rural hinterlands, containing the second wave  of COVID-19 and curtailing the severity of a third wave is the top priority of the Government. With its  limited public health infrastructure and lack of skilled personnel, the rural health system is not  adequately equipped to manage a surge in cases. There is a need for urgent and innovative action to  address this gap. ‘Anamaya’, the Tribal Health Collaborative and other Piramal Foundation initiatives  will help reduce the burden on the system and improve access to healthcare for the rural and tribal  communities.""    100 30-bedded temporary Covid Care Centres are planned at the block level in 25 aspirational districts,  including 4 districts in Maharashtra. Each Centre will cater to the population in the catchment area of  the associated Primary Health Centre. These will be dedicated spaces for COVID positive,  asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases to be isolated and cared for in a well-ventilated room with  essential facilities.    Home Care Support will be provided to 20 lakh rural and tribal communities in 112 Aspirational  Districts through 1,000+ NGOs and 1 lakh plus volunteers to support COVID patients and families as a  viable alternative for asymptomatic, mild symptom patients seeking support from hospitals. Through  local NGOs the intervention will enlist and train Volunteers to engage with patients based on in-  bound/out-bounds calls to educate caretakers to follow COVID protocol and provide timely updates  about patients.  “This pandemic has re-iterated the power of collaboration for all of us. The support from philanthropic  partners and civil society organisations have contributed immensely to each districts preparedness  and COVID response. Piramal Foundation has been a crucial member of our COVID task force in  Nandurbar, they have been supporting us in the Aspirational Districts Programme for three years now  and with this second wave, they’ve left no stone unturned in supporting us with providing essential  medical supplies, following up with home isolation centres, handholding the on-ground staff,  mobilising communities for covid vaccination, and popularising COVID appropriate behaviour through  community and tribal influencers,” said the District Magistrate, Nandurbar, Maharashtra.    About Aspirational Districts:    Government of India has identified 112 Districts across the country based on a composite index of  challenges faced in terms of poverty, with citizens having relatively poor health and nutritional  outcomes, educational status, and deficient infrastructure. 50 % of ADs, are severely affected by  demographic, geographic and socio economic issues, such as 25 districts being tribal dominated, 23  being flood prone, and where 25% of landless households are dependent on manual labour.

12-May-2021,Piramal Swasthya Supports Bihar Government; Helps Control the COVID Situation in Aspirational Districts,"PRESS RELEASE        Piramal Swasthya Supports Bihar Government; Helps Control the COVID Situation in                                   Aspirational Districts    ▪    Working closely with the Bihar government across 5 Aspirational Districts - Sitamarhi, Katihar, Araria,       Sheikhpura and Begusarai  ▪    Engaging with locals on over 3 lakh proactive calls since April 15, 2021    Patna | 11 May, 2021: Piramal Swasthya Management and Research Institute, the primary healthcare and  nutrition initiative under the aegis of Piramal Foundation, in partnership with Government of Bihar is  collectively working to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic across five Aspirational Districts of the state -  Sitamarhi, Katihar, Araria, Sheikhpura and Begusarai. Piramal Swasthya has collaborated with the district  administrations of these Districts, to anchor COVID control rooms. The team is undertaking several critical  initiatives including monitoring field activities of ASHAs, collating reports and running analysis towards  real-time planning to combat the pandemic.    Since April 15, 2021, the team has proactively conducted more than 3 lakh outbound calls to the  beneficiaries from 40 control rooms across the five Aspirational Districts. The ~300 calls that are made  daily, address concerns related to COVID symptoms, precautions to be taken under home quarantine,  home remedies and fear of reinfection.    Piramal Swasthya’s officials have undertaken the responsibility of tracking COVID patients undergoing  home quarantine and migrants returning to their families, through outbound calls on a daily basis. Further,  they are ensuring that the beneficiaries receive the required medicines along with appropriate counselling  to the patients and family members. All this information is compiled and shared with district  administration on a regular basis.    Aditya Natraj, CEO, Piramal Foundation said, “We at Piramal Swasthya, have been working in tandem  with the Bihar government to provide essential support in the Aspirational Districts of the state. The  ongoing second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has thrown multiple challenges on-ground that include  high rate of infection across age groups, lack of oxygen, inadequate trained medical human resources,  amongst others. To reduce the load on the health system, we have prioritized the responsibility to manage  and support home quarantine, and are offering counselling through a combination of remote and on-  ground activities.”    Udayan Mishra, IAS, District Magistrate, Katihar said, “Piramal Swasthya’s efforts are very appreciative.  The pandemic’s second wave has posed great difficulties in the lives of individuals. The rising infections  and reverse migration have resulted in high stress on the existing healthcare infrastructure. Piramal  Swasthya’s team working along with the district administration is a significant progress in the collaborative  efforts required during this pandemic.”                                                        ***  About Piramal Foundation    Piramal Foundation is a Section 8 company that develops innovative solutions to resolve issues that are  critical roadblocks towards unlocking India's economic potential.

22-Mar-2021,"Piramal Capital & Housing Finance Ltd. raises INR 4,050 Crores via issuance of Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs)","             Piramal Capital & Housing Finance Ltd. raises INR 4,050 Crores                    via issuance of Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs)       NCD issuances in two tranches of INR 2,000 Cr. and INR 2,050 Cr., each having a tenor of 5 years     Transformed the liabilities side through multiple capital raise initiatives     Significantly strengthened the balance sheet, with overall PEL-level net debt-to-equity of below 1x    Mumbai | March 22, 2021: Piramal Capital & Housing Finance Limited (PCHFL), a wholly-owned  subsidiary of Piramal Enterprises Limited (PEL or the Company), has raised INR 4,050 Crores through  issuance of long-term, five-year Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) in two tranches. The first tranche  of the NCD issue amounting to INR 2,000 Crores opened on March 10, 2021 with a pay-in on March  12, 2021. The second tranche of the remaining INR 2,050 Crores opened on March 18, 2021 with a  pay-in on March 19, 2021. Leading rating agency, CARE Ratings has assigned an ‘AA’ rating for both  the issuances.    Mr. Rajesh Laddha, Executive Director, Piramal Enterprises Ltd. said, “Since the beginning of FY 2020,  we have significantly transformed the liabilities profile towards more stable, long-term sources of  funds. The Company has raised over INR 50,000 Crores since Apr-2019, through multiple long-term  borrowings and equity transactions, thereby materially strengthening the Balance Sheet. With  net debt-to-equity of less than 1x times, there is adequate growth capital available for both our  business for the coming few years. The five-year NCD issuances of INR 4,050 Crores re-affirm the  significant improvement of our liabilities side and strength of our balance sheet. We are now well  positioned to tap growth opportunities across both our Financial Services and Pharma businesses.”    Since the beginning of FY2020, despite a highly volatile environment, PEL has significantly  transformed its liabilities profile towards more long-term borrowings. As part of this  transformation, the Company has raised over INR 50,000 Crores since Apr-2019, through:       Several equity transactions leading to inflows of over INR 18,000 Crores, which include:         o   Preferential allotment to CDPQ of INR 1,750 Crores.         o   Rights Issue of INR 3,650 Crores, issue was over-subscribed 1.15 times.         o   Sale of DRG for a gross consideration of ~INR 6,950 Crores, in the midst of COVID-19 crisis in           the U.S.         o   Shriram Transport stake sale for INR 2,300 Crores.         o   Fresh equity investment of INR 3,523 Crores for a 20% stake in the Pharma business by The           Carlyle Group. This PE deal, one of the largest in the Indian Pharma sector, valued our           Pharma business at an EV of USD 2.7 - 3.1 billion.       Raised over INR 32,000 Crores of long-term borrowings (≥1 yr. tenure) since Apr-2019, while      significantly reducing the Commercial Paper (CP) exposure from INR 18,017 Crores in Sep-2018      to INR 1,050 Crores as of Dec-2020.        o     Despite the COVID-19 impact, the Company raised INR 18,940 Crores of long term              borrowings (≥1 yr. tenure) via bank loans and NCDs in FY 2021 till date (including the latest              NCD issuances).    These measures have materially improved the ALM profile of the Financial Services business with  substantial positive gaps across all buckets.    In addition, these transactions have meaningfully strengthened the Balance Sheet of the Company,  leading to:        Equity increased by 30% from INR 27,224 Crores in Mar-2019 to INR 35,467 Crores as of Dec-2020.        Net Debt reduction of INR 24,072 Crores (a decline of 44%) since Mar-2019 to Dec-2020.        Net debt-to-equity fell from 2x times as of Mar-2019 to 0.9x times currently.          o     Net debt-to-equity of the Financial Services business has declined from 4.4x times as of              Dec-2018 to 1.9x times – ratio amongst the lowest across sizable NBFCs/HFCs in India,              significantly improving the capital adequacy ratio to 37% as of Dec-2020 from 22% as of Dec-              2018.          o     Net debt-to-Equity of Pharma business has also come down from 0.9x times as of Mar-2020              to 0.5x times as of Dec-2020 – broadly in line with most large Pharma companies of India.        In addition, during Q4 FY 2020, we also increased provisioning in our Financial Services business       by INR 1,903 Crores, thereby taking the total provisioning to INR 2,935 Cr. as of Dec-2020 –       equivalent to 6.3% of the overall loan book or 6.8% of the wholesale loan book – to meet any       contingencies that may arise due to this prolonged adverse environment.        Our strong balance sheet with adequate provisioning and low leverage, post various capital raise       initiatives, will help us in targeting growth initiatives across both Financial Services and Pharma       sectors.        We believe there is significant opportunity to improve utilization of the equity capital available, as       both our businesses have adequate growth capital for the next few years.                                                                *****      About Piramal Enterprises Ltd:  Piramal Enterprises Limited (PEL), a publicly listed company in India, has diversified business interests in Financial Services  and Pharmaceuticals.

25-Nov-2020,Piramal Sarvajal and Center for Water and Sanitation Launch Composite Water Vulnerability Index Tool,"             Piramal Sarvajal and Center for Water and Sanitation Launch                        Composite Water Vulnerability Index Tool                        - Increasing Water Security for the Urban Under-Served -           Pilot study with CWVI (Composite Water Vulnerability Index) tool designed for ranking of slums              o Study showed that 30% households are Beyond the Pipe (BtP)              o Direct correlation between improved water and sanitation and reduction in incidence of                   water borne disease and improved immunity         The tool and the study was launched on the sidelines of a Webinar on ‘Sustainable Water          Security for Urban Under-Served’    Mumbai | November 25, 2020: Piramal Sarvajal, the safe drinking water initiative of Piramal Foundation  launched a tool named Composite Water Vulnerability Index (CWVI) at its recent Webinar on ‘Sustainable  Water Security for Urban Under-Served’ hosted in association with Center for Water and Sanitation  (CWAS) and Centre for Environmental Planning and Technology (CEPT). The CWVI tool is designed to rank  slums on various parameters such as Availability, Accessibility, Reliability, Quality and Burden of Disease.  This tool designed by Piramal Sarvajal in partnership with CWAS was demonstrated through a Pilot study  in 23 slums of Nagpur, in alliance with the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), that has led the way in  smart-city thinking.    As opined and agreed by the panelists during the Webinar, this tool could be replicated in ten smart cities  in Maharashtra and then scaled-up and administered across various smart cities in India. The CWVI tool  will go a long way in defining and identifying highly vulnerable communities and their specific areas of  challenge. This will further help governing bodies to take a more robust approach to resolve the current  problem of provision of reliable and safe drinking water to urban beyond-the-pipe communities.  Leveraging technology and innovation along with cloud computing, digital finance and development  finance will better equip the country to resolve water management problems. These solutions will also  lead to women empowerment by mobilizing them towards community engagement in water.    The speakers at the Webinar on ‘Sustainable Water Security for Urban Under-Served’ included Dr. Swati  Piramal, Vice-Chairperson, Piramal Group and Director, Piramal Foundation; Shri Mahesh Pathak, Principal  Secretary, Urban Development Department, Government of Maharashtra; Hitesh Vaidya, Director,  National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA); Dr. K. Viswanath, Lee Kum Kee Professor of Health  Communication, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Director, Harvard T.H. Chan School of  Public Health - India Research Center; Dr. Meera Mehta Director, CWAS, CEPT and Anuj Sharma, CEO,  Piramal Sarvajal. The webinar was moderated by Prof Dinesh Mehta, CWAS, CEPT University.    As a part of her Keynote Address at the Webinar, Dr. Swati Piramal, Vice-Chairperson, Piramal Group  and Director Piramal Foundation, said, “Over the past years, India has made great strides in providing  access to improved water sources. To truly achieve our SDG targets, it is imperative for us to focus on  ensuring safely managed water and strengthen water security, especially for the urban under-served  communities. At Piramal Foundation, we collaborate with like-minded partners as we remain committed  in our endeavor to provide access to safe and affordable drinking water for all.”    Shri Mahesh Pathak, Principal Secretary, Urban Development Department, Government of  Maharashtra appreciated the sterling work by Piramal Foundation and CEPT. He underlined the  importance of better water management especially waste-water recycling and reuse. He mentioned that  the state government has a policy for waste-water recycling and reuse and many cities – Mumbai, Pune,  Nagpur have been practicing it. This can reduce dependence on fresh-water resources and help improve  water security. He suggested that organisations like CEPT and Piramal Foundation can support cities in  Maharashtra. This is an opportune moment for such activities as under AMRUT 2.0, that will soon be  launched, improving water services will be a key.    Dr. Meera Mehta, Director C-WAS reiterated that access to safe and affordable water is a key to ensure  achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation for all. She said that SDG 6.1 also  focuses on the universal, equitable and affordable access. She emphasized the need to ensure good  quality water for the poor, as well as in schools and health facilities. Role of women and self-help groups  in these activities were also underlined.    Dr. K. Viswanath, Lee Kum Kee Professor of Health Communication, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public  Health and Director, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health - India Research Center spoke about how  water will be a significant problem leading to all kinds of conflict. He congratulated Piramal Sarvajal on  developing an innovative and powerful tool like the Composite Water Vulnerability Index (CWVI) that has  the potential to change behavior, especially essential in the post-Covid world. Speaking specifically on the  utility of the CWVI for urban planners, he said, “A tool like this can easily capture in an understandable  way, the status of health in these communities. Not only does it allow communities to track their progress  over a period of time, but also compare themselves to other communities”.    Anuj Sharma, CEO, Piramal Sarvajal commented, “This pilot study conducted in Nagpur brings the macro-  level challenge to a defined city-level challenge that can be addressed with specific solutions and targeted  impact. We hope that the study will serve as an inspiration for other Civic Bodies to conduct their own  assessment, especially for those living in slums, explore the viability of off-grid solutions and determine  the willingness to pay for such solutions. At Piramal Sarvajal, we believe that using tools such as the CWVI  provides the right impetus to action and believe that this will be adopted widely across India.”    Hitesh Vaidya, Director, National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), spoke about the increasing levels of  urbanization, challenges of providing equitable, reliable and safe drinking water to all, and the need for  researched data for better governance of water supply services by Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).    This Webinar on ‘Sustainable Water Security for Urban Under-Served’ was attended by dignitaries from  the Government, Academia, Civil Society Organizations, NGOs and community at large. The discussions  highlighted sustainable water security options for the urban under-served and the possibility of scaling up  CWVI for ranking of slums by other ULBs of Maharashtra and other states. A complementary mix of pipe  and off-grid services was highlighted for urban water security amongst other urban water service level  benchmarks.                                                                 ***  About Piramal Foundation:  Piramal Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Piramal Group, a global business conglomerate with diverse interests in Pharma,  Financial Services, Real Estate and Glass Packaging, is a Section 8 Company that develops innovative solutions to resolve issues  that are critical roadblocks towards unlocking India’s economic potential.

This will be achieved by setting up decentralised drinking water solutions and           enhancing water security in remote rural areas across five states over the next three years.             This partnership started three years back primarily committing itself to addressing access and quality           issues in drinking water space in remote rural areas. The solution includes decentralised water purification           units and 24x7, solar powered water ATMs, along-with community awareness and maintenance services           as well as real-time online monitoring. The focus has always been on not only creating new community           assets but also on making sure that there is an in-built sustainability mechanism. These projects are in           water-quality affected areas that were identified as under-served. Over the last three years, the           partnership has covered 64 such locations serving 139,000 people daily.

This integrated water management solution will be implemented across 75           villages, half of which will be in aspirational districts, spread over the states of Maharashtra, Rajasthan,           Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. Aspirational districts are backward districts in India, as           identified by NITI Aayog, in terms of basic amenities, infrastructure facilities, health facilities, standards of           living, etc.             Dr. Swati Piramal, Vice-Chairperson, Piramal Group and Director Piramal Foundation, said, “We are           pleased to have partnered with Standard Chartered to provide safe and affordable drinking water to           marginalized sections of society, especially during such unprecedented times. At Piramal Group, we are           driven by our core purpose of Doing Well and Doing Good, and believe in collaborating with like-minded           partners to create transformational impact at scale. We remain committed in our endeavour to serve the           unserved and underserved sections of society, as we continue working in remote geographies across the           country.”             Commenting on project, Zarin Daruwala, CEO, India, Standard Chartered Bank, said, “Daily access to safe           drinking water is one of the key challenges faced by people in remote rural areas, something that we take  PUBLIC                   PRESS RELEASE           for granted but which for them, especially women is a daily drudgery. Our partnership with Piramal           Sarvajal and Enable Health Society aims to address such specific challenges by providing innovative           solutions on the ground to the last mile communities. One of the ways in which we bring our ‘Here for           good’ brand promise to life is by facilitating real change in the communities in the markets we operate           in.”             Centrally, this phase will empower communities by creating appropriate institutional mechanism at the           local level such as Village Water Committees (VWCs) to undertake water budgeting. This will build           community mobilisation to conserve water, reduce wastage and ensure long term sustainability. Women           would be playing a key role in the VWCs. while addressing water challenges, sustainability and community           ownership would underpin the initiative.             Piramal Sarvajal has been a pioneer in leveraging technology for greater reliability and accountability of           its decentralised programs: even the water conservation solution includes IoT based management of the           storage unit and the borewell recharge structure. The sensors will provide data on local water table           showing water stress and over the years document water conservation outcomes.             The impact study by Enable Health Society, finds that beneficiaries, specifically women, who previously           would travel 1-2 kilometers every day to fetch drinking water, recognise the time and energy saved           because of easy access of potable water. The study has also observed that there has been a 70% increase           in the awareness levels of health benefits of safe drinking water. Impact assessment data shows over 40           per cent lesser medical expenses of Sarvajal users as compared to the non-users over a six-month period.

29-Oct-2020,Piramal School of Leadership in Partnership with Emory University Announces India’s 1st Cohort of Social Emotional Ethical Learning Certified Facilitators,"PRESS RELEASE        Piramal School of Leadership in Partnership with Emory University Announces        India’s 1st Cohort of Social Emotional Ethical Learning Certified Facilitators       Piramal School of Leadership (PSL) becomes the first organization in India to build a cohort of      facilitators certified in Social, Emotional, and Ethical (SEE) Learning     The initiative is in partnership with Atlanta based Emory University’s Centre for Contemplative      Sciences and Compassion-based Ethics, that enables humans to flourish by developing educational      programs, facilitating dialogue and engaging in research     PSL will take SEE Learning to 50,000 schools and 50 Lac children by 2025 through Educators      New Delhi, India | October 29, 2020: To mark the successful completion of the first batch of Social  Emotional Ethical (SEE) Learning Level One Facilitator Certification, a first in India, a virtual event was  hosted by Piramal School of Leadership (PSL) in partnership with Centre for Contemplative Sciences  and Compassion-based Ethics, Emory University, Atlanta, USA. 45 Facilitators were awarded  Certificates on completion of the first level of certification, creating India’s first cohort of certified  facilitators in SEE Learning. Gracing the occasion, were Mr. Ajay Piramal, Chairman, Piramal Group,  and Mr. Tempa Tsering, Director India and East Asia, Office of his Holiness The Dalai Lama. The event  was attended by Mr. Lobsang Tenzin Negi, Executive Director, Centre for Contemplative Science and  Compassion-based Ethics, Emory University, Mr. Brendan Ozawa-de Silva, Associate Director SEE  Learning, Centre of Contemplative Science and Compassion-based Ethics, Emory University, Mr.  Aditya Natraj, CEO PSL, as well as employees of PSL and Emory University.  The SEE Learning training is the result of combined efforts of a team of experts in Developmental  Psychology, Education, and Neuroscience from Emory University, inspired by His Holiness The Dalai  Lama, who has long called for an education of heart and mind and a universal, non- sectarian approach  to bringing the ethical development of the whole child into education. His Holiness says, “Research  has shown that such values of empathy, tolerance, forgiveness, and love can be cultivated through  learning and practice on the basis of common sense, experience, and scientific findings”. He believes,  “the time for Social, Emotional & Ethical learning has come”. Promotion of SEE Learning is His  Holiness’s vision for a peaceful world, happier and compassionate humanity, and he hopes that India  can set a model of education of heart and mind to the world.    Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Lobsang Tenzin Negi, Executive Director, Centre for Contemplative  Science and Compassion Based Ethics, Emory University said, “Compassion is key to unlocking human  potential and SEE Learning is at the heart of this. This is a historic moment that we will all look back  to in the future, in the promotion of compassionate education. You are all trailblazers in this journey.  Piramal Foundation has not just embraced the initiatives of SEE Learning at all levels in bringing  transformation in Education but has also brought concrete actions into existence”.    In his keynote address, Mr. Ajay Piramal, Chairman, Piramal Group said, “We are driven by Seva Bhav  - values of service of others before self. This has the potential to transform our country. Planting the  seeds of Seva Bhav in young children is key, making them empathetic and compassionate people. SEE  Learning nurtures harmonious humanity, service orientation, compassion, love, and builds the  foundation for sustainable Seva Bhav. It is a proud moment as this first cohort of certified trainers will  be the torchbearers who will take SEE Learning to Educators across the country”.  The partnership between PSL and Emory University was forged in June 2019 with an agreement to  incorporate SEE Learning in school curriculum as well as adult learning. Towards that, over the last  several months, the facilitators undertook a rigorous discipline of attending residential workshops,  joining peer learning communities, engaging regularly with experts from Emory, participating in  weekly readings, with practice exercises to facilitate sessions for children and adults, while  maintaining a journal of their personal contemplative practices. PSL has also been integrating SEE  Learning across several programs and initiatives, including the Innovation Hub in Jhunjhunu District,  Rajasthan, No Bag Day in Rajasthan, School Health and Wellness Program (SHWP) curriculum at  National Level along with its implementation in Jharkhand, as well as the introduction of SEE Learning  through Arts, Theatre, Poetry, Sports and SHWP across India’s Aspirational Districts. PSL will promote  SEE Learning as a way of life to inspire compassionate and ethical education leaders to radically  transform the public education system by developing awareness, cultivating compassion and  appreciating interdependence.    Aditya Natraj, CEO PSL said, “Education should result in nourishment of body, mind and soul for holistic  development of the child. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasizes that education must  develop not only cognitive capacities and higher order skills, but also social, ethical and emotional  capacities and dispositions among children, in order to build character and enable learners to be  ethical, rational, compassionate and caring, while preparing them for gainful, fulfilling employment.  We are delighted to have partnered with Emory University to introduce SEE Learning, and are  committed to implementing it across 50,000 schools and 50 lac children over the next 5 years.”                                                               ***    About Piramal School of Leadership (PSL):  Piramal School of Leadership (PSL), the education leadership and women empowerment initiative under the aegis of Piramal  Foundation, is a systems transformation and behavior change organization, working on the most complex problems in the  Indian education system.

29-Jul-2020,Piramal Pharma Solutions Announces Integrated Development Program with Bolt Biotherapeutics for Immune-Stimulating Antibody Conjugates and Sterile Fill-Finish,"PRESS RELEASE           Piramal Pharma Solutions Announces Integrated Development Program with Bolt      Biotherapeutics for Immune-Stimulating Antibody Conjugates and Sterile Fill-Finish        Piramal Pharma Solutions (PPS) provides integrated services including formulation       development, antibody drug conjugates and lyophilized drug product in vials      PPS is handling production of Bolt’s Boltbody™ Immune Stimulating Antibody Conjugate (ISAC),       BDC-1001, currently in a first-in-human Phase 1/2 clinical study for treatment of cancer patients      Mumbai, India, July 29, 2020: Piramal Pharma Solutions, a leading contract development and  manufacturing organization (CDMO), today announced that it is providing Bolt Biotherapeutics (Bolt)  with the supply of both the BDC-1001 ISAC drug substance and the drug product for Bolt’s ongoing Phase  1/2 clinical study in cancer patients.      The Piramal Pharma Solutions (PPS) team is applying its integrated drug development model to Bolt’s  BDC-1001 for the treatment of patients with HER2-expressed solid tumors. The program encompasses  formulation development and ISAC development and manufacture at PPS’ Grangemouth, UK site. The  drug substance is then processed into lyophilized, sterile fill-finish vials at PPS’s Lexington, KY, U.S. site.  This seamless integration across two PPS sites, which shortens delivery timelines and expedites  distribution to clinic, is an example of PPS’ patient-centric philosophy.      According to Peter DeYoung, Chief Executive Officer, Piramal Pharma Solutions, “Bolt’s technology  platform has demonstrated significant, positive data in preclinical models, including the development of  immunological memory against tumors, and is now in a human clinical trial. The manufacturing of ISACs  utilizes essentially the same process as antibody drug conjugate (ADC) manufacturing, enabling us to  capitalize on our deep expertise in this space. Our ability to produce these novel ISACs and package them  for clinical trials in one efficient, integrated process compresses the timeline of the development of Bolt’s  drug. We remain committed to our patient-centric approach and are proud to partner with an industry-  leader like Bolt to help reduce the burden of disease on patients.”  Nathan Ihle, VP CMC & Quality for Bolt Biotherapeutics, added, “Bolt is a leader in ISAC technology,  and our partnership with Piramal Pharma Solutions is important to bring our technology to the clinic.  Piramal’s experience in the manufacture of commercial ADCs provides Bolt with a reliable partner for  the development of BDC-1001.”      The first cycle of drug substance to drug product manufacturing has been successfully completed  through PPS’ integrated program. Additional cycles are in progress, as are further developments that will  benefit future indications and new clinical programs.                                                          ***  About Piramal Pharma Solutions:  Piramal Pharma Solutions is a contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO), offering end-to-  end development and manufacturing solutions across the drug life cycle.

Boltbody™ ISACs have  demonstrated the ability to eliminate tumors following systemic administration in preclinical models and have  also led to the development of immunological memory, which is predicted to translate into more durable clinical  responses for patients. The company’s first Boltbody™ to enter clinical development, BDC-1001, is currently being  evaluated in patients with HER2-expressing solid tumors.    About Bolt Biotherapeutics, Inc.  Bolt Biotherapeutics, based in the San Francisco Bay Area, is a private clinical-stage biotechnology company  developing Boltbody™ Immune-Stimulating Antibody Conjugates (ISACs), a new class of immuno-oncology  therapeutics that combine the precision of antibody targeting with the power of the innate immune system.  Boltbody ISACs have eliminated tumors following systemic administration in multiple preclinical studies and spark  the development of immunological memory, which may lead to more durable clinical responses for patients. Bolt's  platform technology is applicable to a broad spectrum of antibodies targeting tumor antigens expressed on all  types of cancer, including patients who are refractory to the current generation of checkpoint inhibitors. The  company was founded by Dr. Ed Engleman, and its platform is based on technology exclusively licensed from  Stanford University. The company is financed by world-class investors, including Novo Holdings, Vivo Capital,  Pivotal bioVenture Partners, Sofinnova Investments, Nan Fung Life Sciences, RA Capital Management, Surveyor  Capital (a Citadel Company), Rock Springs Capital, Pfizer Ventures, and Samsara BioCapital.

(collectively, “Carlyle”, NASDAQ: CG), has agreed to invest fresh equity capital  for a 20% stake in Piramal Pharma Limited (“Piramal Pharma”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Piramal  Enterprises Limited that will contain its pharmaceutical businesses (“Pharma Business”). The  transaction values the Pharma Business at an enterprise value (EV) of US$2,775 million with an upside  component of up to US$360 million depending on the company’s FY21 performance. Based on the EV  (excluding the upside component), exchange rate and pharma net debt as on 31st March 2020, the  estimated equity capital investment for Carlyle’s 20% stake in Piramal Pharma would amount to  ~US$490 million. The final amount of equity investment will depend on the net debt, exchange rate  and performance against the pre-agreed conditions at the time of closing of the deal.    Piramal Pharma will include (a) Piramal Pharma Solutions, an end-to-end contract development and  manufacturing (CDMO) business; (b) Piramal Critical Care, a complex hospital generics business selling  specialized products across over 100 countries; (c) Consumer Products Division, a consumer  healthcare business selling over-the-counter products in India; and (d) PEL’s investment in the joint  venture with Allergan India, a leader in ophthalmology in the domestic market and Convergence  Chemicals Private Limited.

This fresh growth investment into our pharma business will be used  as growth capital for the pharma businesses to expand capacity across our sites as well as to tap  attractive acquisition opportunities within and outside India.

The  total dividend payout on this account would be INR 316 Crores.    Mr. Ajay Piramal, Chairman, Piramal Enterprises Ltd. said, “The last few quarters have been challenging for the  Indian economy. The situation has further worsened due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a subsequent economic  recovery likely to be long-drawn. To navigate through such an environment, we have significantly strengthened  and deleveraged our balance sheet through multiple initiatives to raise capital.  Our Pharma business continues to be operational despite COVID 19 lockdowns and has delivered a healthy revenue  growth of 13% YoY to INR 5,419 Crore and an EBITDA margin of 26% for FY20.  We have consciously shrunk our wholesale loan book by 12% and more importantly, reduced our large single  borrower exposure by INR 4,200 Crores over the past year. Further, given the uncertain macro environment, we  have created INR 1,903 Crores of additional provision to mitigate potential contingencies in our Financial Services  business.  We continue to make best efforts to support our employees, customers and society, towards overcoming this  unprecedented global health crisis.”                                                                                                                  Page 1 of 4        Net Profit Reconciliation: Details of one-off adjustments to determine ‘Normalized Net Profit’:         One-off Adjustments (INR Crores, unless otherwise stated)                                                          Q4 FY2020          FY2020         Reported Net Profit                                                                                                 (1,703)              21          (A) Add: DTA write-off and MAT Credit Reversal                One-time accounting write-off of INR 1,758 Cr. of Deferred Tax Asset (DTA) and reversal of                   +1,758             +1,758                Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) Credit, as the Company opted for a lower tax rate under the new                corporate tax regime          (B) Add: Incremental conservative provisions                One-off incremental provisions of INR 1,903 Cr.

20-Dec-2019,Piramal Enterprises Announces the Appointment of Jairam Sridharan to Lead its Foray into Consumer Finance,"PRESS NOTE           Piramal Enterprises Announces the Appointment of Jairam Sridharan                       to Lead its Foray into Consumer Finance      Mumbai, India | December 20, 2019: Piramal Enterprises Limited (‘PEL’, NSE: PEL, BSE: 500302) today  announced the appointment of Jairam Sridharan as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of its Consumer Finance  Business.      Jairam comes with over two decades of deep expertise in domestic and international retail finance.  Previously, as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Axis, Jairam raised over US$1.8 Bn, the largest private equity  infusion in banking at the time, and led the finance, strategy, M&A and investor relations functions.      Before that, he was President, retail lending & payments at Axis Bank, where he led the transformation  of Axis into a retail bank growing the book 6 times in 5 years. During this period, Axis emerged as one of  the top 5 retail lending institutions in the country. Before joining Axis Bank, Jairam served Capital One  Financial, one of America’s most pioneering tech-enabled consumer banks, as Head of their ‘New to  Credit’ card acquisitions. He started his career at ICICI Bank, where he headed their ‘business intelligence  unit’ and developed the analytical capabilities of the bank.      Commenting on the appointment Anand Piramal, Executive Director, Piramal Group said, “We are  delighted to welcome Jairam Sridharan. Jairam not only has rich experience in building a large retail  finance business but also has deep knowledge of technology and analytics, a combination that positions  us well as we build a business of the future.”      Consumer and small business financing is one of India’s most exciting growth opportunities. Current  penetration in consumer finance in India is a third of China, and a fifth of that in the US. In addition, only  5 out of 80 million MSMEs have access to formal credit. Rapid internet penetration and progressive  government reforms such as IndiaStack and GST have made India a data rich and digitally driven country.      “Our hope is to create a world class new age AI-led lending business that helps fuels the growth of small  businesses and fulfils the aspiration of Indian consumers. We believe greatly in India’s financial services  story, both on the wholesale and retail side, and this foray helps us build a more innovative, diversified  and complete financial services conglomerate.” said Anand Piramal.      Jairam holds a Bachelor of Technology degree in Chemical Engineering from IIT Delhi and Post Graduate  Diploma in Management from IIM Kolkata where he was awarded a Roll of Honour for academic  excellence. In 2015, Jairam was on The Economic Times’ ‘40 Under 40’ list of India’s hottest business  leaders. In 2019, the Institutional Investor magazine named him ‘Best CFO’ in their All-Asia Executive team  for Banks, based on Sell-Side analyst votes.                                                                *****  About Piramal Group:  The Piramal Group, led by Ajay Piramal, is one of India’s leading business conglomerates with a global footprint.

18-Dec-2019,India Resurgence Fund Receives Investment Commitment From Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB),"           India Resurgence Fund Receives Investment Commitment From                     Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB)       CPPIB commits US$225M to the India Resurgence Fund platform (“IndiaRF”)     IFC had earlier committed US$100M     Piramal Enterprises Limited and Bain Capital Credit as joint sponsors, have also committed an initial      US$100M each to IndiaRF     Fund will invest in distressed assets, seeking turnaround and operational improvements      Mumbai, India | Wednesday, December 18, 2019: The India Resurgence Fund platform, a distressed  assets buyout platform set up with Piramal Enterprises Limited and Bain Capital Credit as joint sponsors,  has received a commitment of US$225M from Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, through its wholly  owned subsidiary, CPPIB Credit Investments Inc.    IndiaRF seeks to make investments in assets which are in distress through the purchase of existing debt  and equity securities through bankruptcy courts or directly from lenders, or through newly issued  securities; and to take control over the turnaround of such assets through recapitalization and operational  improvements.    IndiaRF had earlier raised US$100M from the International Finance Corporation (“IFC”) through its  Distressed Asset Recovery Program. IFC has played the role of anchor investor for IndiaRF and will use its  global expertise, alongside that of CPPIB, to help implement environmental, social and corporate  governance standards at IndiaRF.    “We are pleased to anchor a fund that will have a meaningful impact in the Non-Performing Loan (“NPL”)  resolution space with a focus on revival and turnaround. We believe that helping to address India’s NPL  problem will have a very significant positive spillover effect in the economy, including saving and creating  jobs,” said Mengistu Alemayehu, South Asia Director, IFC.    “Our investment in IndiaRF represents an increase in our credit commitments in India, targeting attractive  risk-adjusted returns in the sizeable Indian distressed credit space,” said John Graham, Senior Managing  Director & Global Head of Credit Investments, CPPIB. “Strong partnerships are at the core of how we  invest – a strong local operator with active oversight from a trusted global partner will allow us to further  increase our investments in India for the long term.”    IndiaRF has also raised capital from other international high-net-worth investors and family offices  through the current round.    “The resolution of the NPL problem continues to be an important reform agenda for the Government of  India. The Government and RBI have shown alacrity in addressing the teething issues under the  Bankruptcy Code, which has given confidence to international investors. Setting up of an independent  judicial machinery has led to efficient resolution of these assets and helped preserve the value of many  enterprises. Effective resolution would release capital for banks to fund new capital asset formation,  which would in turn fuel future economic growth for the country. We are delighted that following the  initial support from IFC to this platform, CPPIB has also increased its existing association with the Piramal  Group and its engagement with India,” said Ajay Piramal, Chairman, Piramal Group.    Jonathan Lavine, Co-Managing Partner, Bain Capital and Chief Investment Officer, Bain Capital Credit  said, “We are very pleased that CPPIB and IFC have committed to the IndiaRF platform, two of the largest  and most experienced global and Asia Alternatives investors. It is a strong endorsement of the opportunity  that Bain Capital Credit and the Piramal Group identified at the time of setting up the platform. The  distressed assets opportunity in India presents a unique investment opportunity and continues to attract  the attention of quality long-term international investors”.                                                                       *****    About CPPIB  Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) is a professional investment management organization that invests the funds not  needed by the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) to pay current benefits in the best interests of 20 million contributors and beneficiaries.

17-Dec-2019,Piramal Swasthya and The Rockefeller Foundation Announce Partnership to Accelerate India’s Public Health Transformation,"   Piramal Swasthya and The Rockefeller Foundation Announce Partnership to                  Accelerate India’s Public Health Transformation         Harnessing the Power of Artificial Intelligence of Public Health Outcomes         Collaboration will harness innovative digital technology to support the Government of India’s          vision to provide quality healthcare for all         This partnership will focus on mothers and children in Aspirational Districts, which include          both tribal and non-tribal vulnerable populations of India    Mumbai, Maharashtra | Tuesday, December 17, 2019: Piramal Swasthya Management and Research  Institute, the primary healthcare initiative of Piramal Foundation, and The Rockefeller Foundation today  announced a strategic partnership to align with and support the Government of India’s vision to ensure  Universal Health Coverage. In the initial stages, the partnership aims to set a global example by leveraging  digital technology to reduce preventable deaths amongst mothers and children living in Aspirational  Districts and tribal areas.    The Piramal Swasthya and Rockefeller teams will be working closely with the government on building  cutting-edge primary health innovations and scaling them through policy interventions. The partnership  will strengthen healthcare systems by integrating technologies such as artificial intelligence for evidence-  based decision making. The idea is to save maternal and child deaths by providing appropriate and timely  insights leading to effective policy making and implementation of focused interventions.    The Piramal-Rockefeller partnership focuses on five of the 25 Aspirational Districts that are mentored by  NITI Aayog. They are also part of the 117 Aspirational Districts identified by the Government of India as  having urgent health and development needs. Many residents of these districts are members of tribal  populations, who have significantly worse health outcomes than non-tribal populations. The maternal  mortality rate in India is 122 deaths per 100,000 live births, while in the tribal communities it is even  higher. Similarly, other health indicators such as infant mortality rates, child malnutrition rates, and  incidence of malaria and tuberculosis are much higher among tribal communities than the general  population.    At the outset, the Piramal-Rockefeller partnership will focus on two main streams of work:       Develop and test novel approaches for using digital technology—including mobile          communications, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning—to more          efficiently and effectively deliver primary healthcare services to vulnerable people in their          communities.       Assess how vital information on community health needs can be better collected and analyzed          through digital tools, so that the government and others can make informed, real-time decisions          about targeting health resources.    “We are delighted to partner with The Rockefeller Foundation to leverage our combined strengths and  experiences and to co-create transformative solutions for equitable primary care health services in India.  Health should be a right for everyone, not a privilege for some,” said Dr. Swati Piramal, Vice Chairperson,  Piramal Group, and Director, Piramal Swasthya. “India is at the cusp of a historic public health  transformation, and we are hopeful that this partnership will accelerate government goals to democratize                                                     ----1----  health across the country. Through this partnership, we are committed to building an evidence-based  decision-making culture in the government’s primary healthcare ecosystem in India, and institutionalizing  it. Piramal Swasthya is also building a technology platform for primary care which is going to be a public  good. The platform will help create better ways for the government health workers to make informed  decisions when it comes to identifying issues in primary healthcare. The aim is to create a technology &  evidence driven system as a public good in public primary healthcare which will help create better  governance, accountability and knowledge repository.”    “Digital innovation offers tremendous promise to deliver quality healthcare to more people, especially  the most vulnerable among our communities,” said Dr. Rajiv J. Shah, President, The Rockefeller  Foundation. “By working with Piramal Swasthya, we aim to accelerate India’s commitment to using digital  technology to promote health equity, which will serve as an exemplar for the world.”    The Piramal-Rockefeller partnership brings together two impact- and outcome-driven organizations with  a robust history of collaboration with governments to strengthen public health programs for vulnerable  people. Both teams stand committed towards complementing and supplementing the Indian  Government’s vision of Universal Health Coverage. This partnership will work towards co-creating high  impact solutions that will contribute significantly towards bringing a change in the space of primary public  healthcare that India needs.                                                        ###    About Piramal Swasthya  Piramal Swasthya, under the aegis of Piramal Foundation, is focused on bridging public healthcare gaps by supplementing and  complementing Government of India’s vision to meet Universal Health Care for all.

In cancer, AXL suppresses the body’s immune response to  tumours and drives cancer treatment failure across many indications. AXL inhibitors, therefore, have  potential high value at the centre of cancer combination therapy, addressing significant unmet  medical needs and multiple high-value market opportunities. Research has also shown that AXL  mediates other aggressive diseases.  About bemcentinib  Bemcentinib (formerly known as BGB324), is a potentially first-in-class selective AXL inhibitor in a  broad phase II clinical development programme. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating bemcentinib  in multiple solid and haematological tumours, as monotherapy and in combination with current and  emerging therapies (including immunotherapies, targeted therapies and chemotherapy).  Bemcentinib targets and binds to the intracellular catalytic kinase domain of AXL receptor tyrosine  kinase and inhibits its activity. Increase in AXL function has been linked to key mechanisms of drug  resistance and immune escape by tumour cells, leading to aggressive metastatic cancers.      About AML  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of aggressive leukemia in adults, which has  the lowest survival rate for all types of leukemia. In 2018, it is estimated there were nearly 20,000  new cases of AML diagnosed in the United States. Many AML patients older than age 60 are unable  to tolerate intensive induction chemotherapy treatment.      About BerGenBio ASA  BerGenBio is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing transformative  drugs targeting AXL as a potential cornerstone of therapy for aggressive diseases, including immune-  evasive, therapy resistant cancers. The company’s proprietary lead candidate, bemcentinib, is a  potentially first-in-class selective AXL inhibitor in a broad phase II oncology clinical development  programme focused on combination and single agent therapy in lung cancer and leukaemia. A first-  in-class functional blocking AXL antibody (BGB149) and an AXL-ADC (ADCT-601) are undergoing phase  I clinical testing. In parallel, BerGenBio is developing a companion diagnostic test to identify those  patient populations most likely to benefit from bemcentinib: this is expected to facilitate more  efficient registration trials supporting a precision medicine-based commercialisation strategy.      BerGenBio is based in Bergen, Norway with a subsidiary in Oxford, UK. The company is listed on the  Oslo Stock Exchange (ticker: BGBIO). www.bergenbio.com  ",https://www.piramal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PRESS_RELEASE_-_BerGenBio_PPS_03122019-1-1.pdf,https://www.piramal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/logo.svg,Piramal

Shri Rameshwar Teli –  Member of Parliament and Hon’ble Union Minister of State, Food Processing Industries, Govt. of  India along with MLA Lahoal – Mr. Rituparna Baruah in the presence of Mr. R K Talukdar ED (HR&A),  OIL India Ltd., Mr. Hardeep Singh Bambrah – Head, Assam & North East Operations, Piramal  Swasthya and Mr. Pallav Jha – DC, Dibrugarh, launched 7 mobile medical vans in Dibrugarh today.    Oil India Limited has been conducting mobile dispensary services in the OIL operational areas in  Assam and Arunachal Pradesh through its in-house healthcare team of doctors and paramedics and  catering to the primary healthcare needs of poor and the needy free of cost since 1980s. However,  this has also been supplemented with Project SPARSHA under which mobile health camps are  conducted in remote areas, where access to primary healthcare is a challenge.    Piramal Swasthya Management and Research Institute (PSMRI), one of largest not for profit  organization supported in the public health space has been selected by Oil India Limited as the  implementing partner for this project in the OIL operational areas of Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, Charaideo  districts in Assam and Changlang district in Arunachal Pradesh. The project consists of 7 Mobile  Medical Units, each having a capacity of 2 Doctors, 2 Nurses, and 2 Pharmacists which will conduct a  total of 168 camps on a monthly basis by providing free health checkups, lab tests and medicines to  the targeted and vulnerable population of these districts.    The concept is to basically provide primary health care services to the inaccessible and vulnerable  population of the remote OIL operating areas. This is an end to end solution, thereby cutting the  distance, cost and time of the beneficiaries by providing the health service right at their door steps.  The Mobile Dispensary primarily extends the following services:      i)      Clinically diagnosing and treating select NCDs and chronic diseases and common              diseases /ailments.      ii)     Conduct health checkups, lab tests and dispensing medicines to beneficiaries as deemed              necessary via valid prescriptions provided by competent Medical Officers (Doctors).      iii)    Provide awareness on lifestyle diseases and special flood relief camps          On this occasion, Shri Rameshwar Teli - Honb’le Hon’ble Union Minister of State, Food Processing  Industries, Govt. of India said “ I appreciate the efforts being taken up by Oil India Limited through  their CSR initiatives in providing healthcare services in their OIL operational areas of Assam and  Arunachal Pradesh. Considering the skewed Doctors availability in rural and tea garden areas, the  SPARSHA project will immensely benefit its covered population to a great extent. I also acknowledge  the contributions and experience of Piramal Swasthya in running Govt. and CSR projects across India  including 104 services in Assam. If time permits I will personally visit the camps to have a look at the  activities and will also inform the community members through the village and panchayat members  to avail the SPARSHA services”      Adding on to this, Mr. R K Talukdar, ED (HR&A) OIL India Ltd. said “Oil India limited under our  corporate social responsibility initiative is extending mobile dispensary services in the remotest parts  of its operational areas of Dibrugarh, Tinsukia and Charaideo districts of Assam and Changlang  district of Arunchal Pradesh where medical services are not readily accessible. For implementing OIL  Sparsha mobile dispensary project for the next four years, we have collaborated with Piramal  Swasthya to contribute towards the healthcare sector of our region.”      Commenting on the partnership Shri Vishal Phanse – CEO, Piramal Swasthya said “India has  embarked on the journey towards ensuring Universal Health Coverage and Piramal Swasthya is  contributing with its experience & expertise of building innovative solutions that impact at scale. Our  partnerships with corporates, thought leaders across public & private sectors, innovators & not for  profits in the domain have helped us in moving towards our vision of transforming health  ecosystems. OIL India Ltd has been a proactive partner and expanding our services across Assam and  Arunachal Pradesh would certainly help in moving the health indicators of the states significantly.”  Each of the 7 vans would conduct 24 service camps in a month and the mobilization of beneficiaries  is facilitated by engaging 2 Field Volunteers in each location of service. Given the problems of  availability, accessibility and affordability of primary health services in the remote and unreached  areas of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh by the rural population, the “Sparsha” Mobile Healthcare  Service at the beneficiaries’ doorsteps comes as a boon for the needy patients of the operational  areas of Oil India Ltd.  About Piramal Swasthya  Piramal Swasthya is focused on bridging public healthcare gaps by supplementing and complementing Government of  India’s vision to meet Universal Health Care for all.

19-Nov-2019,Piramal Foundation and Gates Foundation Partner to Setup a Tribal Health Collaborative for India,"PRESS RELEASE                        Piramal Foundation and Gates Foundation Partner to Setup a                                  Tribal Health Collaborative for India       The new Collaborative will focus on improving health and nutrition in high-burden and tribal districts, in      support of the Government of India’s work to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 3 by 2030    Tuesday, November 19, 2019 | India: Piramal Foundation today announced the setting up of a Tribal Health  Collaborative for India - the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will be one of their first partners in this Collaborative.  This multi-stakeholder Collaborative will focus on improving health and nutrition outcomes in high-burden and  tribal districts, including the Aspirational Districts, and aims to support the Government of India as it works  towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 by 2030. SDG 3 is focused on ensuring healthy lives and  promoting well-being for all.    The Tribal Health Collaborative will work closely with the Government of India by supplementing and  complementing its efforts towards achieving Universal Health Coverage. It aims to build a high-performing,  sustainable health ecosystem to address the needs of marginalized sections of society, particularly tribal  communities, covering a population of more than 150 million across several districts, including Aspirational  Districts in Central, Eastern, and North-Eastern India.    Ajay Piramal, Founder, Piramal Foundation said, “We’re committed to supporting India’s vision to achieve its SDG  3 goals by 2030. Increased focus on rapidly transforming the lives of marginalised sections of society, will serve to  accelerate impact at scale. Piramal Foundation has been working with unserved and underserved tribal  communities across several states in India, including 25 of the Aspirational Districts. Given the complexity and  magnitude of the problem, we believe that partnerships with like-minded, values-based organizations such as Bill  & Melinda Gates Foundation, that seek to complement the Government’s efforts, will provide the much needed  impetus. Our proposed Collaborative aims to harmonize the interventions of the Government, Organizations and  Philanthropists with the ‘voice of the community’ by creating a framework to democratize healthcare in India.”    Bill Gates, Co-chair, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation said, “India’s focus on health and nutrition, particularly for  its most vulnerable, is critical to the country and the world’s efforts to meet SDG3. We look forward to continuing  our partnership with the government in its work to improve the health and well-being of the world’s poorest.”    India’s tribal population has poor health indicators when compared to the general population. The average  maternal mortality rate in India is 130 deaths per 100,000 births, while tribal communities average 230 deaths per  100,000 births. Similarly, other health indicators such as infant mortality, child malnutrition rates, and incidence  of malaria and tuberculosis are much higher among tribal communities than the general population.    The Collaborative will rest on two key pillars: working closely with the government, and co-designing and co-  implementing interventions for tribal communities.    The four key functions of the platform include:      1. Facilitating the implementation of key public health interventions in partnership with government          functionaries across all levels.      2. Developing and enabling knowledge sharing across districts by working closely with the District          Administration.      3. Optimizing utilization of district level funding for improved healthcare services.      4. Leveraging technology to ensure better governance and accountability, and creating an integrated         beneficiary-focused health technology platform for the delivery of affordable and accessible primary         healthcare services for all.    The collaborative is slated to launch in early 2020 with participation from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,  Piramal Foundation, and additional partners to be announced.                                                                     *****    About Piramal Foundation  Piramal Foundation is a Section 8 company that develops innovative solutions to resolve issues that are critical roadblocks towards  unlocking India's economic potential.

(PCHFL) for Commercial Paper Programme worth Rs.10,500 Crores.  CRISIL has evaluated the business and financial risk profile of the overall financial services  business, and also factored the managerial and financial risk profile of the holding company,  Piramal Enterprises Limited’s (PEL) lending book.    PCHFL welcomes these topmost ratings as it reaffirms the Company’s robust business portfolio,  diversified revenue streams and established presence across the spectrum of real  estate financing along with increased product offerings. Over the last nine months, in line with  our efforts to improve the asset-liability profile, ever since the first signs of liquidity strain  emerged in the Indian market, the Company has raised funds of INR 23,700 Crores.    CRISIL in its report stated that “the company has put in place adequate credit appraisal, strong  risk management and processes, which has supported the reported asset quality metrics. The  management too has taken steps in order to reduce concentration risk in the portfolio with  focus on growing the individual housing loans portfolio. But, what has really supported the  asset quality metrics in the past, has been the ability of the entity to get timely repayments/exits  via refinancing. In fiscal 2019, in addition to a regular Rs 3,601 crores of collections, the Group  has also received prepayments to the tune of Rs 13,483 crores. For some of the loan accounts,  the group has received prepayments covering the scheduled re-payments over the next 12-24  months.    The report stated that on a standalone basis, the resource profile for PCHFL is well diversified  across instruments with bank and financial institutions loans at 61%, NCDs constituting around  24% and Commercial Papers at 16% as on March 31, 2019. The management is also taking  proactive steps to improve the resource profile mix through increasing long-term funding  sources. The Company has managed a sanction of Rs 1,050 crores (USD 150 million) of ECBs in  the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and also plans to raise additional long term funds in the current  fiscal, which would support the diversification into longer term funding sources.”    CRISIL has recently also assigned the highest rating A1+ to PEL for the short-term non-  convertible debentures amounting to Rs 1500 crores and the commercial paper programme  amounting to Rs. 12,000 crores by (PEL).

The company will provide its housing finance offerings namely home loans, loans against     property and small ticket construction finance for home buyers (salaried and self-employed) in the Indore market.       With a robust network of 800+ developer relationships and 3,000+ channel partners, the housing finance business     of PCHFL has 16 branches across 15 cities. Going forward, in the next 3-6 months, PCHFL plans to open its housing     finance operations in Navi Mumbai and Palava.       Commenting on the launch, Mr. Khushru Jijina, Managing Director, Piramal Capital & Housing Finance Limited     said, “Indore is an important growth market for PCHFL. This launch marks our foray into Madhya Pradesh and is     aligned to our strategy to expand our housing finance presence where there is a growing demand for real estate     and home loans. We are excited to partner with developers & channel partners to strengthen their business and     offer housing finance solutions to their customers. Currently, the housing finance business contributes ~10% to     PCHFL’s overall loan book, which is expected to increase to 15-18% by March 2020.”       PCHFL has three innovative products in its portfolio that cater to the needs of the market and customers.     I.    SUPERLOANS factor in future income potential whilst assessing the credit parameters for a retail loan to         enable customer to purchase their ideal home. SUPERLOANS is designed to enable customers to buy their first         home at a much younger age (28 years as opposed to the generally observed average age of 35 years of first-         time home buyers)  II.    AdvantAGE is a product where in the initial years, the loan is serviced based on the combined income and         after few years, the loan is serviced at a lower EMI based on the income of only one applicant for e.g. father         and son  III.   Bridge is a product for customers who wish to buy a new house but have to wait to sell their existing house.         Bridge loan gives time to these customers to sell their existing property to the right buyer and covers the         funding gap between purchase of new house and sale of existing house.       PCHFL has a focused strategy to expand its housing finance business which is a combination of multiple elements:     a unique business model – B2B2C – (business to developer to customer) which is a key differentiator; existing     robust relationships with developers & channel partners combined with innovative offerings; and a single window     that provides end-to-end financing solutions.

20-Jun-2019,"Piramal Pharma Solutions Expands its High Potency API Capability at Riverview, MI Facility","PRESS RELEASE          Piramal Pharma Solutions Invests $10 million USD to Expand its High Potency                   API Capability in its Riverview Facility in U.S.           ~ Expansion enhances the company’s ability to serve the growing ADC market ~    Riverview, Michigan, June 20, 2019: Piramal Pharma Solutions (PPS), a leading Contract Development  and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO), today announced the Grand Opening of a new wing at the  Riverview site dedicated to the production of high potency active pharmaceutical ingredients (HPAPIs)  with low Occupational Exposure Levels (OELs). The total investment required to upgrade the site was  approximately $10 million USD. This includes the new QC/analytical lab and two kilo-labs, as well as a  doubling of the office space, which was needed to support the dramatic growth at the Riverview site.  Local dignitaries participated in the event, including Riverview Mayor Andrew Swift, Wayne County  Executive Warren C. Evans and other officials representing the City of Riverview, Wayne County and  Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC).  To date, the Riverview site has had the containment capability and engineering controls to safely handle  HPAPIs with OELs down to 1mcg/m3, at scales ranging from grams to ~250 kilos. The new wing, which  consists of two kilo-labs and a QC/analytical lab, brings more to the table. It was designed with the  required engineering controls and containment solutions to handle HPAPIs with OELs <1mcg/m3 and as  low as ~20ng/m3. Materials will primarily be produced in this new wing at kilo-lab scales; lots of <5 kilos  can be produced in this new state-of-the-art facility.    Vivek Sharma, CEO, Piramal Pharma Solutions said, “We are one of only a few companies in the contract  development and manufacturing market that have the capability to produce HPAPIs at such low OELs. It’s  another example of how we remain committed to partnering with our customers to serve the patient  community and reduce the burden of disease.”    Historically, the site operated as one shift, five days a week. Today, the site operates twelve hours a day,  seven days a week, and is headed towards being a full 24/7 site. The Riverview site expansion also provides  significant benefits to the local economy, including the addition of new high-tech jobs. The local staff has  increased from 80 to 127 people, with a projected total of approximately 150 employees in the near  future. This includes high-tech staffing of PhD and BS degreed scientists, plus manufacturing operators  and other skilled workers.    Vince Ammoscato, Vice President and Riverview Site Head, added “This new, enhanced capability opens  the site up to a new base of customers, including the antibody drug conjugate (ADC) market. We are  equipped to offer ADC customers a seamless end-to-end solution, since we can develop the HPAPI  payloads and linkers here in Riverview, send them to our site in Scotland for the antibody conjugation,  then back to our Lexington, Kentucky site for sterile fill and finish.”    The ability to offer a fully integrated solution for the ADC market – from proof-of-concept studies to  conjugation development, clinical and commercial ADC GMP batch manufacturing and fill/finish –  represents a significant strategic advantage for Piramal Pharma Solutions.    According to Mr. Ammoscato, more expansions are forthcoming. There is additional real estate available  on the site for added capacity and new capability enhancements that will be designed to match the market  needs of the pharmaceutical industry.                                                     ***    About Piramal Pharma Solutions:  Piramal Pharma Solutions is a contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO), offering end-to-end development  and manufacturing solutions across the drug life cycle.

28-May-2019,Piramal Foundation Leverages Internet of Things (IoT) to Sustain Water Resources across India,"    PRESS NOTE        Piramal Foundation Leverages Internet of Things (IoT) to Sustain Water Resources                                       across India         Launched ‘Smart Stand Post’: An Automated Volume Water Dispensing Unit as a Pilot Project        across 5 districts of Madhya Pradesh    Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh | 28 May 2019: Piramal Foundation and Public Health Engineering  Department (PHED) of Madhya Pradesh at a summit in the city today, deliberated on implementing  effective solutions to enable sustainability of water resources through innovative use of technology.  The summit saw national experts speak on ‘Source Sustainability’ and discuss its application in the  Madhya Pradesh. The inaugural session was attended by Shri Sukhdev Panse, Hon’ble Minister PHED;  Shri Sanjay Shukla, Principal Secretary PHED; Mr. Anuj Sharma, CEO, Piramal Sarvajal and Shri  Rajendra Hardenia, Senior Social Activist - Water Management amongst other prominent experts  and government officials from across the country.    Speaking on the initiative, Shri Sukhdev Panse, Hon’ble Minister PHED said, “This has been a fruitful  initiative with experts brainstorming on impactful implementable solutions on Source Sustainability.  Piramal Foundation’s IoT enabled Smart Stand Post that we will be piloting in the state holds a promise  to the nation as a whole. We are confident that we can implement these learnings to bring about  transformation at grassroots level.”    As per a recent report by the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture, a country is classified as water  stressed and water scarce if per capita water availability goes below 1700m3 and 1000m3 respectively.  With 1544m3 per capita water availability, India is already a water-stressed country and is moving  towards becoming water scarce. Apart from the promotion of water conservation efforts for water  resources availability and groundwater recharge, there should be an effective water management  system linked with the performance of local level water institutions.    Mr. Anuj Sharma, CEO, Piramal Sarvajal said, “India accounts for ~17% of the world’s population and  only 4% of the world’s fresh water resources. Due to an inefficient water resource management  system and climate change, India faces a persistent water shortage. The urgent need of the hour is to  implement solutions that can make safe drinking water easily available to all. With the use of  technology such as Internet of Things (IoT) we can democratize water access, reduce water wastage  and arrest unauthorized usage of water. While we implement new methods of recharging water  resources, these measures would be able to distribute the precious resource in an equitable manner.  A pilot will soon be demonstrated.”    Piramal Foundation today also launched the Smart Stand Post, a smart card based automated water  dispensing unit that will soon be demonstrated at Swajal habitations. Unlike existing water units,  Smart Stand Post will have 3 options for dispensing water free of charge from an overhead. This will  allow access to multiple users at the same time but prevent unauthorized (without smart cards) users.  Through IoT, the data from sensors will be captured and forwarded to a central server for remote  monitoring.  The 4 key advantages of Smart Stand Post technology over conventional methods of water delivery  are:  1) Time Efficiency: Multiple users can access water simultaneously from a single unit.  2) Prevents Unauthorised Access: Restricted to authorised RFID card holders.  3) IoT enabled Real-time Monitoring: Allows for early intervention of resource availability and real       time data collection of water dispensed.  4) Data Analysis: Enables analysis of water usage patterns to support better anticipation & planning.      The 5 districts earmarked to Piramal Foundation in MP, to facilitate implementation of Swajal Scheme  are Khandwa, Damoh, Barwani, Vidisha and Singrauli.    Speaking on the occasion, Shri Sanjay Shukla (IAS), Principal Secretary PHED in his key note address  said, “PHED has been working with Piramal Foundation and other partners for implementing the  Swajal schemes in the 7 Aspirational Districts of MP. I urge policymakers and key stakeholders to  institutionalise sustainability structures to enable efficient source sustainability of water, that has so  far been a challenge in drinking water programmes, historically.”    The summit today was on Source Sustainability and IoT (Internet of Things) in the Swajal Scheme of  the Government. Swajal is a pilot project by Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation (MDWS), that  is designed as a demand driven and community centered program to provide access to safe drinking  water on sustainable basis to people in rural areas. The scheme has been currently launched in 112  Aspirational Districts of India.    The summit had 2 panel discussions on water sustainability models and challenges of implementing  them. The panels comprised of domain experts such as Dr. P.K. Jain (CGWB), Mr. Ajay Diwakar (PHED),  Mr. Uday Patankar (GSDA Maharashtra) and amongst others.

07-May-2019,Piramal Enterprises Limited Signs MoU with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board,"PRESS RELEASE        Piramal Enterprises Limited Signs MoU with Canada Pension Plan Investment           Board; Sets Up Asset Aggregation Platform Focused on Renewables       Execute MoU to co-sponsor a renewable energy focused InvIT with a targeted initial corpus of      US$600m; CPPIB and PEL initially allocate US$360m and US$90m respectively, with the ability to      scale further     First perpetual ‘white label’ platform to aggregate operating assets with a stable yield profile      across both solar and wind    Tuesday, 7th May 2019, Mumbai, India: Piramal Enterprises Limited (“PEL”) today signed a  Memorandum of Understanding with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (“CPPIB”), a Canadian  pension fund, to co-sponsor a renewable energy focused Infrastructure Investment Trust (“InvIT”).  With an initial corpus of US$ 600 million, and the option to scale further, the InvIT would seek to  acquire up to 1.5-2GW of stable and cash generating renewables assets on a hold-to-maturity basis,  with a firm focus on diversification of both asset type as well as off-taker profile.    Ajay Piramal, Chairman, Piramal Group, said “We are pleased to partner with CPPIB on the launch of  the first ever InvIT in India, focused on renewables. The foundation of this partnership is based on a  shared ethos and values that leverage CPPIB’s global track record of value creation in the  infrastructure space with PEL’s long term strategy and goodwill in India. We are enthusiastic about  the opportunity as it is truly scalable and continue to remain committed to creating value for our  shareholders.”    Both PEL and CPPIB will act as Co-Sponsors of the proposed InvIT and hold up to 75% of the units (with  CPPIB committing US$360m and holding up to 60%; PEL committing US$90m and holding 15% ) and  seek to raise capital from other like-minded investors for the remaining 25%.

We believe that the  timing is therefore opportune for aggregating assets in this sector given that the existing players are  willing sellers in light of a constrained capital market environment - both debt and equity. This is the  first truly neutral ‘white-label’ InvIT – led by a fiduciary and supported by patient capital and strong  corporate governance – that we believe, can serve as a strong catalyst for the sector as a whole.”                                                                ***    About Piramal Enterprises Limited:    Piramal Enterprises Limited (PEL) is one of India’s large diversified companies, with a presence in Financial Services,  Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare Insights & Analytics.

As an extension to this  programme, PFEL is working in partnership with Government of Jharkhand and NITI Aayog to  improve Education Indicators in Pakur and Sahibganj districts. Through the Aspirational Districts  Transformation Programme (ADTP) PFEL supports District Collectors and District Education Officials  to develop the capacity of 200 Middle Managers for supportive supervision. It also enables  community engagement and alignment of multiple stakeholders for improving learning outcomes  and school enrolment in these districts.    One of the key challenges identified in Pakur and Sahibganj was low attendance. To address this,  Gandhi Fellows, PFEL’s on-ground implementers, mobilized ‘Bal Sansad’ (student cabinet) by  conducting workshops in 30 government schools of Barhait block, Sahibganj.

Gablofen should be reserved for patients unresponsive to oral baclofen therapy, or those who experience  intolerable central nervous system side effects at effective doses.  Patients should first respond to a screening dose of intrathecal baclofen prior to consideration for long term  infusion via an implantable pump.  Spasticity due to traumatic brain injury: wait at least one year after injury before considering Gablofen therapy.  IMPORTANT RISK INFORMATION   WARNING: DO NOT DISCONTINUE ABRUPTLY   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning   Abrupt discontinuation of intrathecal baclofen, regardless of the cause, has resulted in sequelae that include   high fever, altered mental status, exaggerated rebound spasticity, and muscle rigidity, that in rare cases has   advanced to rhabdomyolysis, multiple organ-system failure and death.   Prevention of abrupt discontinuation of intrathecal baclofen requires careful attention to programming and   monitoring of the infusion system, refill scheduling and procedures, and pump alarms. Patients and caregivers   should be advised of the importance of keeping scheduled refill visits and should be educated on the early   symptoms of baclofen withdrawal. Special attention should be given to patients at apparent risk (e.g. spinal   cord injuries at T-6 or above, communication difficulties, history of withdrawal symptoms from oral or   intrathecal baclofen). Consult the technical manual of the implantable infusion system for additional post-   implant clinician and patient information.    CONTRAINDICATIONS  Hypersensitivity to baclofen.  Do not use Gablofen for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous or epidural administration.  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Risk of life-threatening overdose during pump refills. Use extreme caution when filling the Medtronic  SynchroMed® II Programmable Pump which is equipped with an injection port that allows direct access to the  intrathecal catheter. Direct injection into the catheter through the catheter access port may cause a life-  threatening overdose.  Use only with Medtronic SynchroMed® II Programmable Pump (or other pumps labeled for intrathecal  administration of Gablofen (baclofen injection)).  Potential for contamination due to non-sterile external surface of prefilled syringe. Although the drug solution  and pathway in the Gablofen prefilled syringes are sterile, the external surface of the prefilled syringes (all  strengths, including the 50 mcg/mL strength) are non-sterile and have the potential to lead to contamination  and consequent adverse reactions. The use of Gablofen prefilled syringe in an aseptic setting (e.g., operating  room) to fill sterile intrathecal pumps prior to implantation in patients is not recommended, unless the  external surface of the prefilled syringe is treated to ensure sterility. Gablofen supplied in vials may be used  with conventional aseptic technique to fill intrathecal pumps prior to implantation.  Resuscitative equipment and trained staff must be available during screening dose, dose titration, and refills  due to the potential life-threatening CNS depression, cardiovascular collapse, and/or respiratory failure.  Overdose may cause drowsiness, lightheadedness, dizziness, somnolence, respiratory depression, seizures,  rostral progression of hypotonia and loss of consciousness progressing to coma.  Use with caution in patients with psychotic disorders, schizophrenia or confusional states as it may exacerbate  condition(s).  Fatalities have been reported with intrathecal baclofen use.  Caution should be used in patients with a history of autonomic dysreflexia.  Presence of infection may increase the risk of surgical complication and complicate dosing of Gablofen.  May cause drowsiness: use caution in operation of automobiles, dangerous machinery and activity that may  be hazardous by decreased alertness. Other CNS depressants and alcohol may add to this effect.        Potential development of intrathecal mass formation. Clinicians should monitor for signs and symptoms of  new neurologic symptoms including the use of imaging diagnostic modalities.  Oral baclofen use has been associated with a dose-related increase in incidence of ovarian cysts.  ADVERSE REACTIONS  SERIOUS ADVERSE REACTIONS  Sudden withdrawal of Gablofen can result in serious complications that include high fever, confusion, muscle  stiffness, multiple organ-system failure, and death. Inform patients that early symptoms of Gablofen  withdrawal may include increased spasticity, itching, and tingling of extremities. If Gablofen withdrawal or a  pump malfunction is suspected, patients should be brought immediately to a hospital for assessment and  treatment.  Gablofen overdose may occur suddenly or insidiously, and symptoms may include confusion, drowsiness,  lightheadedness, dizziness, slow or shallow breathing, seizures, loss of muscle tone, loss of consciousness, and  coma.  Other serious adverse events may include: potential development of intrathecal mass formation, drainage,  infection, meningitis, unmanageable trunk control, CSF leakage, coma and death.  COMMON ADVERSE REACTIONS  The most common adverse reactions in patients with spasticity of spinal origin were hypotonia (25.3%),  somnolence (20.9%), dizziness, nausea/vomiting, hypotension, headache, and convulsions.  The most common adverse reactions in patients with spasticity of cerebral origin were hypotonia (34.7%),  somnolence (18.7%), headache (10.7%), agitation, constipation, leukocytosis, chills, and urinary retention.  Other common adverse events may include hypoventilation, hypertonia, paresthesia, increased salivation,  back pain, pruritus, diarrhea, peripheral edema, asthenia, pain, confusion, speech disorder, amblyopia,  accidental injury, and dry mouth.  USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  Pregnancy Category C. The effect of baclofen in labor and delivery is unknown.  Breastfeeding: Baclofen is excreted into breast milk at oral therapeutic doses.  Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 4 years have not been  established.  MITIGO™ INDICATIONS AND USAGE  MITIGO (Morphine Sulfate Injection, USP – Preservative-free) is an opioid agonist for use in continuous  microinfusion devices and indicated only for intrathecal or epidural infusion in the management of intractable  chronic pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are  inadequate. Important Risk Information    WARNING: RISKS WITH NEURAXIAL ADMINISTRATION; LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; RISK OF  ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME; and RISKS FROM  CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS See full prescribing information for  complete boxed warning.    Single-dose neuraxial administration may result in acute or delayed respiratory depression up to 24 hours.  Because of the risk of severe adverse reactions when MITIGO is administered by the epidural or intrathecal  route of administration, patients must be observed in a fully equipped and staffed environment for at least 24  hours after the initial dose.  Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor closely, especially upon initiation  or following a dose increase. Patients must be observed in a fully equipped and staffed environment for at  least 24 hours after each test dose and, as indicated, for the first several days after surgery.  MITIGO exposes users to risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess  patient’s risk before prescribing and monitor regularly for these behaviors and conditions.  Prolonged use of MITIGO during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be  life-threatening if not recognized and treated. If prolonged opioid use is required in a pregnant woman, advise  the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be  available.  Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants,  including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve  concomitant prescribing for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate; limit  dosages and durations to the minimum required; and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory  depression and sedation.    CONTRAINDICATIONS  Significant respiratory depression  Acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting in absence of resuscitative equipment Concurrent  use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or use of MAOIs within the last 14 days  Known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus  Hypersensitivity or intolerance to morphine Neuraxial administration of MITIGO is contraindicated in patients  with: Infection at the injection microinfusion site, concomitant anticoagulant therapy, uncontrolled bleeding  diathesis the presence of any other concomitant therapy or medical condition, which would render epidural  or intrathecal administration of medication especially hazardous  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Risk of Inflammatory Masses: Monitor patients receiving continuous infusion of MITIGO via indwelling  intrathecal catheter for new signs or symptoms of neurologic impairment. Risk of Tolerance and Myoclonic  Activity: Monitor patients for unusual acceleration of neuraxial morphine, which may cause myoclonic-like  spasm of lower extremities. Detoxification may be required. Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in  Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Monitor closely,  particularly during initiation and titration.  Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient  off of the opioid. Severe Hypotension: Monitor during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of MITIGO in  patients with circulatory shock Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors,  Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of MITIGO  in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.    ADVERSE REACTIONS  Most serious adverse reactions were respiratory depression, apnea, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest,  shock, and cardiac arrest. Other common frequently observed adverse reactions include: sedation,  lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and constipation.    USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm. Hepatic and Renal Impairment: May affect the metabolism and excretion  of MITIGO.

20-Jan-2019,Piramal Sarvajal Provides Accessible Safe Drinking Water Solutions across Bhubaneswar,"    Piramal Sarvajal Provides Accessible Safe Drinking Water Solutions across                                   Bhubaneswar       Leverages ‘Hub & Spoke’ model to provide access to safe drinking water     Deployed 40 water ATMs that have delivered ~20 lakh litres water since 2006    Bhubaneswar, India |January 02, 2019: Piramal Sarvajal, an initiative of the Piramal Foundation, has  strategically deployed 40 water ATMs to make safe drinking water accessible across key locations by  using its ‘Hub & Spoke’ model, in Bhubaneswar. In response to an outbreak of jaundice and dengue  cases that occurred in Bhubaneswar in 2014, due to broken water supply lines, a tender was floated by  Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation. This tender was awarded to Piramal Sarvajal in 2016 for  installation of safe drinking water facilities. The innovative ‘Hub & Spoke’ Model consists of 1  purification unit (Hub) and 10 water ATMs (Spokes). A Customized tanker vehicle dispenses water  through no-touch transfer mechanism, thereby maintaining the purity of the purified water.    Commenting on the development, Anuj Sharma, CEO, Piramal Sarvajal said, “We are delighted with the  successful deployment of our water ATMs and the resultant off-take witnessed in areas where  previously, access to safe drinking water has been a luxury. Leveraging technology for monitoring and  key observations provides key insights for our teams, which in turn enable us to offer impactful  solutions. The substantial increase in beneficiaries reaffirms our commitment to democratize access to  safe drinking water across India.”    To minimize reoccurrence of such incidents and to address the challenges of access to safe drinking  water faced by the urban underserved population (slums and public places) in Bhubaneswar, Piramal  Sarvajal has deployed 4 purification plants (Hub) and 40 water ATMs (Spokes) across the city. The  consumers can individually avail 10 litres of water free of cost, daily, in flexible quantities, from any of  the Piramal Sarvajal ATMs by using RFID card. Since its set up in 2016, Piramal Sarvajal has provided  access to over 20 lakh litres of safe drinking water in Bhubaneswar.    Piramal Sarvajal aims to work towards reaching the last mile. It ensures studying and setting up plants,  timely maintenance, spreading awareness and consumption of safe drinking water through its  innovative and impactful solutions. The key considerations for efficient deployment of Piramal Sarvajal  ATMs:       Building awareness on ATM locations       Proximity to denser population of beneficiaries    Based on a review of expected optimal capacity utilization for each ATM, 14 of the 40 Water ATMs were  found to be under-utilized. And as suggested to Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation, these 14 ATMs  are being moved to new locations with better water 0ff-take opportunities. The first 4 relocated ATMs  are already dispensing more than 450 litres per day on an average.                                                   -End-  About Piramal Sarvajal:    Piramal Sarvajal, seeded by the Piramal Foundation in 2008, is a mission-driven social enterprise which  believes that pure drinking water should be accessible and affordable for everyone.

Currently, PCHFL has a strong presence in wholesale real estate funding in Ahmedabad and now has launched its  retail offerings for home buyers (salaried and self-employed). The company provides end-to-end real estate  financing solutions across the entire capital stack such as structured debt, construction finance, flexi lease rental  discounting, housing finance etc. The housing finance business will offer home loans, loan against property and  construction finance in the Ahmedabad market.    Building on its strong relationships with developer partners in Ahmedabad, PCHFL has sanctioned and disbursed  INR 2000 crores through its wholesale business. Now with the launch of its retail business, PCHFL will be able to  offer holistic financial solutions across the entire spectrum of real estate.    Known for its innovative products that meet the needs of the market and customer, PCHFL today announced the  launch of two new products - AdvantAGE and Bridge. AdvantAGE is a product specially designed for father-son  where both father & son pay higher EMI in the initial years and then in the later years the son pays lower EMI for  the remaining tenure. Again, Bridge is a product for customers who wish to buy a new house but have to wait to  sell his/her existing house.

Samhi Group owns ~29 hotels and has marquee investors. This structured debt investment will allow Samhi  Group to support their growth plans and refinance existing lenders across three assets – The Courtyard and  Fairfield by Marriott in Bangalore, the Sheraton in Hyderabad and the Hyatt Regency in Pune.    This is the third significant investment made by PCHFL in the hospitality sector over last 6 months. Prior to this,  PCHFL had invested ~INR600 crore with the Gurgaon based Vatika Group (against the Westin Gurgaon and the  Westin Sohna) and ~INR600 crore with Advantage Raheja Group (against the JW Marriott, Bangalore and the  Crowne Plaza, Pune). All loans are against operational assets.    PCHFL has also concluded 5 other transactions, totalling to ~INR450 crore against 5 hotel assets, (three  operational and two in final stages of construction and fit out) operated by top tier brands like Taj, Hyatt,  Radisson, etc. across regions like Bangalore, Hyderabad, Shimla and Goa. Of this, INR100 crore will be extended  as last mile funding towards the completion of the first Taj Luxury Resort in Himachal Pradesh coming up in  Theog, near Shimla. The Taj Theog is a 99 key full service five star luxury property built over a hilltop of ~5 acres  with a 360° view of the Himalayan range and is expected to be operational within the next six to nine months.    Mr. Khushru Jijina, Managing Director, Piramal Capital & Housing Finance Ltd said “We believe that this is an  opportune time to target the hospitality sector with ‘intelligent’ capital. As the traditional lenders are unable to  provide ‘holistic’ solutions, expertise of our Group and our presence across the capital stack enables us to cater  to this industry with unique customized solutions and innovative structures. Our ability to act as a catalyst  between owners and operators alike further adds to our distinct competitive advantage over others. Over a  span of 6 months, we have deployed INR ~2000 crore towards the hospitality sector as we scale our offerings  within this vertical to reach a target book size of INR 10,000cr in the next 3 years. The industry is firmly on a  path of growth, ably supported both domestic and foreign tourism, has higher disposable income and is  witnessing a general change in spending habits of target customers.”    Mr. Ashish Jhakanwala, Founder and CEO of SAMHI Group said “We continue to see accretive acquisition  opportunities in hotel sector and we are perhaps best positioned to take advantage of these. We have found,  in Piramal, a partner of choice given their unique understanding of the sector coupled with their ability to  provide flexible and targeted funding that allows us to pursue growth while maintaining the right capital  structure.”    About Piramal Capital & Housing Finance Limited:  Piramal Capital & Housing Finance Limited (PCHFL), wholly owned subsidiary of Piramal Enterprises Limited (the flagship  company of Piramal Group), is registered as a housing finance company with National Housing Bank (NHB) and engaged in  various financial services businesses.

16-Jul-2018,Piramal Capital & Housing Finance Limited Receives a Rating of ‘CARE AA+; Stable’ From CARE Ratings,"   Piramal Capital & Housing Finance Limited Receives a Rating of ‘CARE AA+;                            Stable’ From CARE Ratings    Mumbai, 16th July 2018: Piramal Capital & Housing Finance Limited (‘PCHFL’) has been assigned  a long term rating of ‘CARE AA+; Stable’ for its debt instruments post the scheme of  amalgamation of Piramal Finance Limited (‘PFL’) and Piramal Capital Limited (‘PCL’) with PCHFL  (erstwhile Piramal Housing Finance Limited). PFL was rated ‘CARE AA; Stable’ by CARE Ratings  and post the amalgamation, the long term debt instruments have been assigned a rating of  ‘CARE AA+; Stable’ in PCHFL. PCHFL has now become a wholly owned subsidiary of Piramal  Enterprises Limited (PEL) and is the flagship entity for the Group’s financial services business.    This rating recognizes the strong performance across both real estate and non-real estate  sectors over several quarters, takes into account robust risk management metrics, a stringent  in-house asset management and monitoring process that has kept NPAs in check despite a  strong ramp up of the lending business. The rating also reflects conscious and sustained effort  to diversify the asset base even as the scale of business increased and add granularity to the  loan book through a foray into retail Housing Finance, lending more towards construction  finance and lease rental discounting under Real estate segment, expansion to multiple sectors  by the Corporate Finance Group and focus on mid-market corporate through the Emerging  Corporate Lending vertical.    The rating also factors in a highly successful QIP and Rights Issue undertaken by PEL during the  past financial year of ~INR 7,000 crore, of which INR 5,000 crore has been allocated to the  financial services business. On the liability side, the ratings reflect robust treasury management  with low levels of leverage.    Mr. Khushru Jijina, Managing Director, Piramal Capital & Housing Finance, said “FY2018 was  an eventful year for us as we made conscious and definitive strides towards an increasingly  diversified and more granular portfolio. We continued to grow our real estate lending business  with a foray into hospitality and an increased exposure to Lease Rental Discounting (LRD).”    He further added, “For non-real estate, the growth in our Corporate Finance Group comprised  mainly of senior debt and project finance and with Emerging Corporate Lending, we set the  foundation for more granular lending. Our retail housing finance vertical also established a  strong footprint in a relatively short period of time.”    “We believe that with the restructuring and the recent allocation of capital, coupled with our  complete suite of diversified products across wholesale and retail will prove to be a distinct  competitive advantage in our journey of continued growth. This credit rating from CARE serves  as a fitting validation of our efforts” he said.  About Piramal Capital & Housing Finance Limited:  Piramal Capital & Housing Finance Limited (PCHFL), wholly owned subsidiary of Piramal Enterprises Limited (the flagship  company of Piramal Group), is registered as a housing finance company with National Housing Bank (NHB) and engaged  in various financial services businesses.

Learning Centers were set-up for students for their lessons and  homework after school, by engaging the community youth.    In collaboration with NPSS, several initiatives were implemented to increase the enrollment in schools,  through participation in events such as ‘Pravesh Utsav’, where the Gandhi Fellows, with the support of  headmasters and teachers performed ‘Nukkad Nataks’ and organized rallies.

The Programme targets the unserved and under-served, and endeavors to make quality  primary healthcare services available, accessible and affordable for all.    In India, basic healthcare is a critical challenge for the unserved and underserved populace, due to lack  of resources, lack of adequate medical centres and steep costs of treatments. Karnataka has made  significant progress in providing healthcare facilities to the residents over the last few decades.  However, despite the progress, the State has a long way to go in achieving the desired health goals.  Inequity in access to healthcare services, as evidenced by health outcomes in Karnataka, makes it  imperative to come up with supportive programmes to provide available, accessible and affordable  healthcare to the underprivileged communities.    Commenting on the initiative, Mr. Ittira Davis, MD & CEO, Ujjivan Financial Services said, “Ujjivan has  always conducted self-sustained social development programmes for the benefit of the community at  large, and has believed in its CSR well before it was made mandatory under the Companies Act, 2013.  Ujjivan has partnered with Piramal Foundation for executing various CSR Programs in the Healthcare  space, and on behalf of Ujjivan and in collaboration with Piramal Swasthya, we endeavor to provide  technology enabled health services to the community at large, specifically the unserved and  underserved.”    Mr. Vishal Phanse, CEO, Piramal Swasthya said, “Piramal Swasthya envisions transforming the primary  health ecosystem in India by providing high impact solutions through thought leadership and  partnerships. Mobile medical vans have made a positive impact on communities that we serve. This  collaborative initiative will focus on providing accessible and affordable primary healthcare services to  the unserved and underserved communities. Ujjivan Financial Services has been one of the proactive  partners in this regard, and we are optimistic that our partnership will aid in improving the state’s health  outcomes.”                                                            ***  About Ujjivan Financial Services:    Ujjivan Financial Services Ltd. is registered as an NBFC-Non-Deposit-taking Systemically Important - Core Investment Company –  (NBFC-ND-SI-CIC) with RBI and is the holding company and promoter of its 100% subsidiary “Ujjivan Small Finance Bank”, which  is a small finance bank and licensed under Section 22 (1) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 to carry on the business of small  finance bank in India.

The growth in income was primarily driven by increase in size of loan book, which grew  by 69% to Rs.42,168 Crores vs Rs.24,975 Crores in FY2017. Construction Finance now accounts for 60% of our  real estate loan book. Gross NPA ratio (based on 90 dpd) as on 31 March 2018 was at 0.3%.

Global Pharma FY2018 revenues were higher by 13.1% to Rs.3,976 Crores and Q4 FY2018 revenues grew 12.9%  to Rs.1,245 Crores and. Growth was driven mainly on account of addition of new products, strong order book  and delivery across all key segments of the business. The Global Pharma margins for FY2018 have improved to  22% as compared to 20% during FY2017 on back of high margin acquisitions and operational improvements.  During the quarter, the Company underwent 11 regulatory audits (including 2 USFDA inspections) and 35  customer audits. The products acquired from Janssen & Mallinckrodt continue to perform in line with  expectations. The transition and integration are progressing well.    Revenue from India Consumer Products for FY2018 was at Rs. 346 crores, impacted by the introduction of  GST and its implementation. Residual impact of GST on the wholesale channel can still be felt across the  industry. Revenue for the quarter was lower at Rs.85 Crores due to the base effect (as the business had  delivered a growth of 45% YoY in Q4FY2017) reduction of trade spends and normalization of credit policy from  Q4 onwards. During the year, the company acquired Digeplex and associated brands from Shreya Lifesciences  to consolidate its position in the gastro-intestinal (GI) segment.    Healthcare Insight & Analytics (HIA)    Revenue for FY2018 was Rs.1,209 Crores and for the quarter was at Rs.234 Crores, a growth of 3%. Growth  during the quarter was driven by strong growth in Life Sciences Data & Analytics, which was partly offset by  lower demand for research products, which are being replaced with dynamic, user-centric applications.  Currency fluctuations also impacted the topline. The Company continues to evolve its delivery model from large,  static research reports to (a) digitally delivered, user-centric applications, and (b) analytics services.

The Programme targets the unserved and under-served, and  endeavors to make quality primary healthcare services available, accessible and affordable for all.    In India, basic healthcare is a critical challenge for the unserved and underserved populace, due to lack  of resources, lack of adequate medical centres and steep costs of treatments. Maharashtra has made  significant progress in providing healthcare facilities to the residents over the last few decades.

The  infant mortality rate of 24 per 100 live births and maternal mortality of 68 per 1 lakh live births (source –  National Family Health Survey 4 and NITI Aayog) are significantly high. Inequity in access to healthcare  services, as evidenced by health outcomes in Maharashtra, makes it imperative to come up with  supportive programmes to provide available, accessible and affordable healthcare to the  underprivileged communities.

Ujjivan  Financial Services has been one of our proactive partners, and our partnership would definitely help in  positively improving the state’s health outcomes.”                                                            ***  About Ujjivan Financial Services:    Ujjivan Financial Services Ltd. is registered as an NBFC-Non-Deposit-taking Systemically Important - Core Investment Company –  (NBFC-ND-SI-CIC) with RBI and is the holding company and promoter of its 100% subsidiary “Ujjivan Small Finance Bank”, which  is a small finance bank and licensed under Section 22 (1) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 to carry on the business of small  finance bank in India.

14-Feb-2018,Piramal Finance targets affordable and mid-income housing sector,"Press Release    Piramal Finance targets affordable and mid-income housing sector           Identifies initial pipeline of INR3000cr across major metros; intends to scale up to US$2bn by 2020         Dedicated team to focus on pure and preferred equity transactions         Unique ability to facilitate financial closure for the project, as well as home finance for end users, at time of          entry itself    Wednesday, 14th February 2018, Mumbai: Piramal Finance Limited (PFL), a subsidiary of Piramal Enterprises Limited,  has set up a dedicated team to invest in affordable and mid-income residential projects across major metros in India.  PFL has identified an initial pipeline of INR3000cr with transactions across the major metros under active  consideration.    With the unique ability to participate across the entire capital stack, PFL will follow its trademark partnership  approach for its investments in the affordable housing space.    PFL is able to provide both pure and preferred equity capital to top-grade developers that are looking to buy or  develop land and need early-stage growth capital. PFL may also actively pursue an opportunistic acquisition of land  on its own accord and invite developers to participate on a joint development basis.    At the same time, through its proprietary wholesale loan book PFL is able to sanction milestone linked construction  finance for the project so that the developer is able to achieve financial closure for the project at the very outset.  With the introduction of RERA, this is a unique advantage as it enables the developer to unilaterally focus on  executing the project without worrying about financing.    Additionally, through PFL’s sales and research function Brickex, the developer is able to leverage a multi channel  distributor and broker network to identify a marketing strategy and incentivize a community of partners that will  further drive primary sales.    Finally, typical end users projects within this segment tend to be a mix of both salaried professionals and self  employed individuals. Traditional home loan providers tend to focus on the salaried class which restricts the  developer’s ability to generate interest from self employed end users for want of financing. Piramal Housing Finance  is able to bridge this gap by funding individual home buyers (both salaried and self-employed) through a range of  tailor made products focused on the affordable segment.    Khushru Jijina, Managing Director, Piramal Finance Limited and Piramal Housing Finance Limited, said “While many  players in the market are focused on providing equity or debt capital towards affordable and mid income housing,  we believe that our ability to provide a comprehensive end-to-end solution – including both early stage equity as  well as construction linked debt – is truly unparalleled as it helps the developer achieve financial closure for the  project on Day Zero. Our ability to further drive sales through Brickex and fund those sales through customized home  loan products specifically tailored towards salaried as well as self employed end users acts as unique competitive  advantage. We now have a highly experienced team focused exclusively on scaling our presence within this segment  and intend to scale up to US$2bn by 2020.”  About Piramal Enterprises Limited  Piramal Enterprises Limited (PEL) is one of India’s large diversified companies, with a presence in Financial Services, Pharmaceuticals and  Healthcare Insights & Analytics.

18-Jan-2018,Piramal Finance Limited Forays into the Hospitality Sector,"PRESS RELEASE                    Piramal Finance Limited Forays into the Hospitality Sector    - Commits INR 1200 crores across Marquee Hotel Assets in Gurgaon (Westin), Bangalore (JW                                   Marriott) and Pune (Crowne Plaza) -    Mumbai, January 15, 2018: Piramal Finance Limited (PFL), a subsidiary of Piramal Enterprises Limited, has  forayed into the hospitality sector with multiple transactions done in quick succession. The platform has  committed INR 650cr towards two marquee hotel assets in North India, followed by another INR 550cr  across another two assets in Bangalore and Pune, respectively.    PFL deployed INR 650cr in Vatika Hotels Pvt Ltd, thereby providing a comprehensive financing solution to  the Vatika Group to consolidate their existing lenders and increase their stake in the company by providing  an exit to existing equity investors. The investment was made against two established hotel assets being  operated by Marriott. The Westin Gurgaon is a 313 room key hotel strategically located in Gurgaon’s  central business district near IFFCO Chowk. The hotel has been operational since 2010 and is a highly  successful business cum leisure destination with consistently high occupancy rates and an established F&B  and Banqueting business. The Westin Resort Sohna is an established destination property developed as a  weekend getaway located an hour away from IFFCO Chowk.    Similarly, in one of the largest fund raising deals within the hospitality sector in Bangalore, PFL has  sanctioned ~INR 550cr of structured debt towards the Advantage Raheja Group (promoted by Mr Deepak  Raheja) to support their growth plans and enable a refinance of existing lenders across two hospitality  projects – The JW Marriott in Bangalore and the Crowne Plaza in Pune. Both the properties enjoy the  advantage of being in prime locations and expect excellent growth in terms of Occupancy and Revenue  per Available Room (RevPAR).    Hospitality is an evergreen sector and quality assets at good locations have thrived across business cycles.  Hotels are long gestation projects and require long term financing partners who can provide tailor made  solutions which can help the asset ride successfully across business cycles. PFL has always followed a  partnership approach and will follow similar approach with respect to investments in hospitality with the  ability to participate across the entire capital stack – be it senior debt opportunities, mezzanine funding,  last mile funding towards completion and acquisition financing opportunities in the sector.    Khushru Jijina, Managing Director, Piramal Finance Limited, said “Identifying a niche in the market and  creating uniquely customized funding solutions has always been our forte and we have been fortunate in  being able to apply the same across sectors in the past. The hospitality sector is uniquely positioned at  the intersection of being both a real estate and a service oriented business in our opinion and through the  combination of our Wholesale RE Funding platform, the Corporate Finance Group and our Capital Markets  Group, we are able to service the needs of this industry across the entire capital stack, on behalf of both  hotel owners as well as operators, on a holistic basis. I look forward to many more such transactions as  we commit more resources towards the sector.”    Gaurav Bhalla, Director, Vatika Group, said “We are extremely pleased to have extended our partnership  with the Piramal Group beyond residential and concluded a transaction against our hotel assets. We  believe they bring a unique perspective along with an ability to understand the business extremely well  and have provided us with unique insights as well as creative and customized solutions time and again to  meet our growth capital needs.“    Deepak Raheja, Promoter, Advantage Raheja Group, said “The team from Piramal was able to  understand the industry dynamics and create a tailored solution that would not have otherwise been  possible from a standard / typical lender. I am extremely pleased with our association which transcends  beyond the provision of capital towards engagement on the growth and revenue optimization strategy  for both the hotel assets and we look forward to scaling this relationship further.”                                                                   ***    About Piramal Enterprises Limited:  Piramal Enterprises Limited (PEL) is one of India’s large diversified companies, with a presence in Financial Services,  Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare Insights & Analytics.

ICRA also notes the synergies that the existing business will provide to  the retail housing finance vertical established in September. This growth will be supported by an ever  increasing understanding of the dynamics of the market segments that PFL lends towards and adequate  risk assessment systems and processes to monitor and effectively manage the portfolio.

14-Nov-2017,"Piramal Swasthya Announces the Launch of D.E.S.H. – a Community-Based Cancer Screening Program for Early Detection of Oral, Breast and Cervical Cancer in Assam","PRESS RELEASE         Piramal Swasthya Announces the Launch of D.E.S.H. – a Community-Based Cancer Screening              Program for Early Detection of Oral, Breast and Cervical Cancer in Assam           Aims to reduce the impact of Oral, Breast and Cervical Cancer burden in the state through          early screening and detection, thereby reducing late-stage diagnosis and mortality         Key components of the model include community outreach, education and mobilisation,          screening for cancer, referral and mobility for treatment at cancer hospital, continuous          tracking and follow-up         Program covers a population of 15 lakh in remote villages of Kamrup district         Collaboration with Dr. B. Borooah Cancer Institute for referral and treatment of positive cases         Appropriate technology-based program ensuring end-to-end coverage with continuous          tracking, referral and follow-up      Guwahati, November 13, 2017: Piramal Swasthya, an initiative under the aegis of Piramal Foundation  (the philanthropic arm of the Piramal Group), today announced the launch of its community-based  cancer screening program – D.E.S.H., to detect cancer early and thereby reduce mortality. It is  expected to reduce the impact of the cancer burden in Assam through early detection of Oral, Breast  and Cervical Cancers in rural areas.    Dr. Swati Piramal, Vice Chairperson, Piramal Group, who has been closely involved in the project,  inaugurated D.E.S.H in Guwahati, by flagging off a state-of-the-art Mobile Cancer Screening Unit.    Need for the Program in Assam:    Cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. In India, the cancer  burden is high and is projected to increase over one-and-a-half times in the next 20 years. Within  India, Assam has the highest proportional mortality ratio due to cancer. Kamrup is the district with  the 4th highest incidence of cancer-afflicted persons in India, according to the Population-Based  Cancer Registry Report (2012-14). States in the north-eastern region, due to a multitude of reasons,  have few effective cancer screening programs and very few cancer care centres.    D.E.S.H. – Detect Early, Save Her/Him:    Piramal Swasthya has launched its community-based screening program – D.E.S.H. for Oral, Breast  and Cervical Cancers in Kamrup. The program components include creating community awareness,  screening for cancer through mobile cancer screening units, mobility for the patients detected positive  to a treatment centre, tracking and follow-ups.  Equipped with cutting edge equipment (including a mammography unit) and staffed by doctors,  nurses and radiographers, the Mobile Cancer Screening Unit will screen the local population for oral,  breast and cervical cancer every Monday to Thursday. On Fridays and Saturdays, another vehicle will  be used to ferry those who have screened positive, to Guwahati’s Dr. B. Borooah Cancer Institute.  Unique features:         Community-based mobile cancer screening unit         Counselling session for those who were detected positive         Provision of transport for these patients to Dr. B. Borooah Cancer Institute.         Safe and secure Electronic Medical Record for every patient with a Unique Beneficiary ID for          monitoring and tracking         Referral and follow-up of positive patients, thereby ensuring complete end-to-end cover         Patients to be enrolled with the existing Atal Amrit Yojana insurance program      Speaking about the initiative, Dr. Swati Piramal, Vice-Chairperson, Piramal Group, said, “Piramal  Swasthya aims to transform India’s health ecosystem through high impact solutions, partnerships and  thought leadership. Cancer awareness and screening is of utmost importance as it ensures early  detection, thereby increasing the chances of survival and reduction in treatment costs. The North-  Eastern states of India are reported to have the highest incidence of cancer, with Kamrup district being  ranked the fourth-highest. There are very few cancer care centres or programs in Assam to cater to  such patients. The difficult climatic conditions, coupled with poor infrastructure, leads to reporting of  only advanced cases with a higher morbidity and mortality.    “Piramal Swasthya has realised a need for a community-based cancer screening program in Assam to  prevent, screen, diagnose and treat Oral, Breast and Cervical Cancers in rural areas. We believe that  our program will have a significant impact in helping to reduce cancer-related mortality in Assam. After  successful implementation in Kamrup, this program can be scaled across the state and the rest of the  North-East region as well.”                                                         -ends-    About Piramal Foundation:    Piramal Foundation is the philanthropic arm of the Piramal Group.

As is standard practise across our platform, we committed  to an in depth study of the sector over the past few quarters which, has culminated in announcing these  first two transactions. The industry has grown at a 15% CAGR over the last decade, which is significantly  higher than the OEMs themselves. Both RSB and Indoshell have long standing relationships with major  OEMs and command higher wallet share of their respective customer set. We look forward to more such  transactions as we further scale up our investment focus towards this sector.”    RK Behera, Chairman and Managing Director, RSB Group said “We are pleased to have partnered with  an organisation of such repute as being a funder of choice in the market today. This investment has  provided us with a long-term solution to our capital requirements. Going forward, we believe the auto  component demand would be fuelled by stable government framework and increasing economic  activity.”    Balaji Jagadeesan, Managing Director, Indo Shell Mould said “This tranche of funding from the Piramal  Group has helped us solve a cash flow mismatch situation and further enables us to meet the  incremental demand from two wheeler OEMs. In addition, we are now well placed to cater to our export  clients in the commercial vehicle segment through our new state-of-the-art export oriented facility  situated near Coimbatore.”  About Piramal Enterprises Limited:  Piramal Enterprises Limited (PEL) is one of India’s large diversified companies, with a presence in Pharmaceuticals,  Healthcare Insights & Analytics and Financial Services.

Addressing his fans present at the Pandal, Prosenjit said, “Durga Pujo is actually the celebration of ‘life’  and it is the most anticipated time of the year for many of us. This has also been a hectic time for me  professionally, with the release and recent success of my film, ‘Yeti Obhijaan’. Yet, I haven’t shied away from  gorging on some of my favourite Pujo delicacies like Kosha Mangsho, Fish Kobiraji, Shingara and some spicy  Puchkas. But on the downside, a combination of heavy, spicy foods, irregular meals and lack of sleep can  often aggravate my acidity, for which I use an effective antacid like Polycrol.”    A product by Piramal Healthcare, Polycrol has helped relieve acidity for millions of consumers, since the  past 50 years. Irregular eating patterns, fasting and then enjoying the rich and spicy festive cuisine, as it  happens during festivals such as Durga Pujo, may often lead to acidity. Polycrol contains activated  dimethicone, magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide, all of which work collectively to neutralise  stomach acids and release entrapped gases in the stomach, providing express relief..    Keeping Indian palates and preferences in mind, Piramal Healthcare launched a new, refreshing, Paan  flavoured variant of Polycrol earlier this year. Going forward, there are plans for more such variants.    “Polycrol has been a part of my household and it has truly been a saviour for me. I carry a bottle of Polycrol  with me wherever I go, so I can eat what I want without worrying about acidity. This Durga Pujo, I would urge  all my fans to enjoy the festivities, and eat to their heart’s content. I wish everyone a Shubho Maha Ashtami!”  added Prosenjit.    On October 1st, Prosenjit’s fans will also have the chance to interact with the superstar online, via  Facebook Live.

01-Nov-2017,Piramal Imaging to Present New Research in PET Imaging at CTAD Annual Meeting,"        Piramal Imaging to Present New Research in PET Imaging at CTAD Annual Meeting      Research Presented Provides Further Insights into Amyloid Imaging and New Data on Investigational                                             Imaging Agents    Boston, November 01, 2017 ‒ Piramal Imaging today announced new research on positron emission  tomography (PET) imaging tracers to be presented at the 10th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease in  Boston. Presentations on the approved diagnostic imaging agent florbetaben F18 cover new kinetic  analyses and more detailed information on the clinical impact of amyloid-PET imaging. Clinical updates of  tau PET-imaging tracer PI-2620 will be presented.    Scientific updates at the CTAD conference – November 1-4, 2017  Location: Boston Park Plaza, Boston, MA, US            Clinical evaluation of 18F-PI-2620, a next generation TAU PET agent in subjects with Alzheimer’s           disease and progressive supranuclear palsy           Date: November 2, 2017 | 9:00-9:15am ET           Presenter: Oral presentation by Dr. Andrew Stephens, MD, PhD Piramal Imaging          Value of 18F-florbetaben amyloid PET in the diagnostic work-up of most complex patients with           dementia in France: a naturalistic study           Date: November 4, 2017 | 10:30-10:45am ET           Presenter: Oral presentation by Dr. Mathieu Ceccaldi, MD, PhD AP-HM - Hôpital de la Timone,           Marseille          Simplified Non-Invasive Tracer Kinetic Analysis for 18F-Florbetaben PET using a Dual Time-           Window acquisition protocol           Date: November 3 and 4, 2017           Presenter: Poster presentation by Dr. Andrew Stephens, MD, PhD Piramal Imaging        About Neuraceq™ (florbetaben F18 injection)    Indication  Neuraceq™ is indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of the brain to estimate beta-  amyloid neuritic plaque density in adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for  Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other causes of cognitive decline.    A negative Neuraceq™ scan indicates sparse to no amyloid neuritic plaques and is inconsistent with a  neuropathological diagnosis of AD at the time of image acquisition; a negative scan result reduces the  likelihood that a patient's cognitive impairment is due to AD. A positive Neuraceq™ scan indicates  moderate to frequent amyloid neuritic plaques; neuropathological examination has shown this amount  of amyloid neuritic plaque is present in patients with AD, but may also be present in patients with other  types of neurologic conditions as well as older people with normal cognition.  Neuraceq™ is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations.  Limitations of Use       A positive Neuraceq™ scan does not establish the diagnosis of AD or any other cognitive          disorder.       Safety and effectiveness of Neuraceq™ have not been established for:          o Predicting development of dementia or other neurologic conditions;          o Monitoring responses to therapies.    Important Safety Information    Risk for Image Interpretation and Other Errors  Neuraceq™ can be used to estimate the density of beta-amyloid neuritic plaque deposition in the brain.  Neuraceq™ is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations. Neuraceq™ images should be interpreted  independent of a patient's clinical information. Physicians should receive training prior to interpretation  of Neuraceq™ images. Following training, image reading errors (especially false positive) may still occur.  Additional interpretation errors may occur due to, but not limited to, motion artifacts or extensive brain  atrophy.    Radiation Risk  Administration of Neuraceq™, similar to other radiopharmaceuticals, contributes to a patient´s overall  long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with  an increased risk of cancer. It is important to ensure safe handling to protect patients and health care  workers from unintentional radiation exposure.    Most Common Adverse Reactions  In clinical trials, the most frequently observed adverse drug reactions in 872 subjects with 1090  Neuraceq™ administrations were injection/application site erythema (1.7%), injection site irritation  (1.1%), and injection site pain (3.4%).    About the tau research collaboration  PI-2620 was discovered in a research collaboration between Piramal Imaging and AC Immune, a Swiss-  based clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on neurodegenerative diseases. Piramal Imaging  obtained the exclusive, world-wide license for research, development and commercialization of all tau  PET tracers generated within the discovery program. First-in-man clinical studies were performed at  Molecular Neuroimaging LLC, a division of Invicro LLC, New Haven, Connecticut.    About Piramal Imaging SA  Piramal Imaging SA, a division of Piramal Enterprises, Ltd., was formed in 2012 with the acquisition of the  molecular imaging research and development portfolio of Bayer Pharma AG. By developing novel PET  tracers for molecular imaging, Piramal Imaging is focusing on a key field of modern medicine.  www.piramal.com/imaging  For More Information:  Investor Relations: Hitesh Dhaddha / Bhavna Sinyal | Piramal Enterprises Ltd.

With a total investment of INR 2,400 crores, including land and project execution costs, Agastya  Corporate Park sprawls over 16.25 acres, and offers its occupants 50,000 sq. ft. of landscaped  greenery amidst a dynamic, state-of-the-art environment, in Kurla. Piramal Enterprises, one of  India’s large diversified companies, will anchor its offices at Piramal Ananta in Agastya Corporate  Park. The company will consolidate over 800 employees and their operations at the commercial hub.    Constructed in a record 19 months, the forecasted revenue of the total leasable area of 1.9 million  square feet (Phase 1 & Phase 2), Agastya Corporate Park will record INR 5,300 crore in revenue –  the summation of net rentals and sale.    Anand Piramal, Executive Director, Piramal Group, said: “Agastya Corporate Park is a  representation of the future of Mumbai’s commercial real estate industry. A destination where  organisations can thrive amidst the outdoors, Agastya Corporate Park is envisaged to become a  workspace of the future. With world-class amenities, stunning and stimulating décor and interiors,  and a state-of-the-art façade, this commercial district will enable companies, employees, and  retailers to be part of a truly dynamic and collaborative environment.”    The campus design, based on the principle of Biophilia, which seeks to connect human life and  nature, integrates natural elements of light and ventilation to create a harmonious work  environment that promotes well-being and efficiency within a progressive office campus with  timeless architecture. The blend of articulated long elevations, aesthetic terracotta panels and glass  is a conscious mix of modern and tradition to create a striking building façade and high performance  values. The double glazed units with acoustic interlayer façade provides excellent thermal and noise  insulation. Low rise buildings framing a large central garden, provide the perfect interplay between  work and nature.    Occupants of Agastya Corporate Park will be able to take advantage of a slate of amenities,  including: a 600-plus seater contemporary Food Hall, Fine Dining and Grab & Go eateries, bar &  lounge, cafes, bakery, a variety of stores, ATMs, entertainment spaces, ample parking facilities,  state-of-the-art surveillance, among others.    Phase 1 of Agastya Corporate Park comprises three independent buildings that are connected by  greenery. The project features premium multi-format office space, key retail and F&B offerings,  plenty of green open spaces, and spectacular outdoor terraces for gatherings and events.    Designed by leading industry players in the global commercial real estate space, Agastya Corporate  Park offers warm-shell office premises, finished common areas, open spaces, centralised air-  conditioning, dedicated passenger & service elevators and staircases, conference/board room  facilities for meetings, dedicated service yard for smooth functioning, ample car parking, integrated  building management system, and visitor management at the concierge’s desk.  Agastya Corporate Park has been designed by Seattle-based Callison USA. BuroHappold managed  the Structural & MEP Design services, while Belt Collins Singapore assisted in planning and design.  L&T India and Turner India worked together on the construction of Agastya, while Lerch Bates  oversaw vertical transportation.    A destination within itself, Agastya Corporate Park will attract office-goers and visitors from  surrounding locales, where retailers can gain access to the right crowd. Designed to be a one-stop-  shop for all needs, Agastya Corporate Park will seek the best retailers to provide quality products  and services that live up to the expectations of today’s increasingly savvy consumers.    The interiors of the PEL offices were organized around the concept of how we live culturally and how  the whole village is organized around the large central square, where there would be a well where  people have a reason to come and meet. Then there are smaller street squares or nodes where  people of different age groups would come to meet and mingle with each other. These are  opportunities where people come to meet and build relationships. These would then lead to greater  bonding among people and help to resolve bigger challenges of their daily life.    This metaphor had been captured on every floor, with a large central meeting space and smaller  pantry areas scattered along the floor. The privilege of light and ventilation is given to all with all  meeting rooms distributed to the central core. Since people travel long to reach workplaces in  Mumbai, enough resting spaces, shower rooms, crèche facilities and Food provisions have been  addressed at strategic locations. The facility is centrally air-conditioned to allow for energy efficiency  and to create more pleasant work atmosphere. Carefully integrated greenery, colors, art and  graphics create a soulful modern workplace. The PEL offices will also house all new age office  facilities that include a creche, gymnasium, games room, massage room and large terraces that  enhance employee experience.    Agastya Corporate Park offers seamlessly connectivity to the International and Domestic Airports,  Bandra Worli Sea Link, Bandra Railway Station, and the Eastern and Western Express Highways.  Additionally, the development is within 7 to 10 minutes from Bandra Kurla Complex, Kurla Railway  Station, Vidyavihar Railway Station, and the Santacruz Chembur Link Road.

05-Jul-2017,Piramal Finance Limited introduces a unique ‘Flexi Line of Credit’ for the renewable energy sector – sanctions an additional INR700cr to ACME Solar Holdings Limited,"PRESS RELEASE    Piramal Finance Limited Introduces a Unique 'Flexi Line of Credit' for the Renewable Energy Sector                   - Sanctions an Additional INR700cr to ACME Solar Holdings Limited -    Mumbai, July 5, 2017: Piramal Enterprises Limited (NSE: PEL, BSE: 500302), through its subsidiary  Piramal Finance Limited (PFL), sanctioned an additional INR700Cr to ACME Solar Holdings  Limited (“ASHL”). The deal was made through Corporate Finance Group (“CFG”) of Piramal Finance  Limited by introducing a new product - a Flexi Line of Credit - for the renewable energy sector. This aims  to make a line of funding available to the borrower based on operational projects, with the flexibility to  draw/repay during the tenure.    ACME is one of the largest Independent Power Producers (IPP) in solar energy space in the country with  a portfolio of over 1.8GW. The current operational capacity by July end is over 1 GW, reaching 1.4 GW  by September end and company is present across the 14 states. PFL had first invested Rs. 499 Cr with  ACME in July 2016, together with its partner APG.    Mr. Khushru Jijina, Managing Director, Piramal Finance Ltd., said, “We are pleased to offer the second  round of funding to ACME group with our unique ‘Flexi Line of Credit’. ACME has a strong track record of  execution, with projects spread across the country, which reduces the off-take risk, and has signed PPAs  for the complete portfolio. In addition, our first round of funding has already seen pre-payments taking  place in a short span of time. They are among the best managed renewable energy companies in the  country, in terms of quality of portfolio and growth.  Renewable Energy has been one of the key focus area for our group and Piramal has benefited by  being one of the early movers in the sector. Given the government’s focus on clean energy,  we believe, renewables will be one of the key contributors to the energy requirement of the country  and Piramal is committed to continued investments in sustainable energy in the near future.”    ACME Group Chairman and Managing Director, Mr. Manoj Kumar Upadhyay, said, “We are happy to  partner with Piramal for the second time over the last one year. The current funding provides us with  the required flexibility to invest in solar and electric transportation business and ensure timely  completion of projects. Given the growth dynamics of the renewable space in India we believe  renewables would constitute major portion of India’s installed capacity.”    The Corporate Finance Group (CFG) has been one of the early movers within the Renewable Energy  space. CFG has diversified over time both in terms of sector and in offerings. CFG is now sector agnostic  and offers capital across the risk curve including senior debt, acquisition finance, promoter finance,  private equity exits alongside its previous focus on mezzanine investments. Though infrastructure which  includes roads and renewables has been the focus so far, recently the group has also funded corporates  in cement, entertainment, security management, packaging and more recently, the auto components  and logistics space.                                                    ***  About Piramal Enterprises Limited:  Piramal Enterprises Limited (PEL) is one of India’s large diversified companies, with a presence in  Pharmaceuticals, Healthcare Insights & Analytics and Financial Services.

Operating Profit       Operating profit for Q4 FY2017 was 135% higher at Rs.1,119 Crores, primarily driven by strong revenue       performance across all businesses during the quarter, increase in non-operating other income and fall in R&D       expenses.

Interest Expenses  Interest expense for the Q4 FY2017 and FY2017 were higher primarily on account of increase in debt for making  investments under Financial Services segment.

As is standard practise across our platform, we committed  to an in depth study of the sector over the past few quarters which, has culminated in announcing these  first two transactions. The industry has grown at a 15% CAGR over the last decade, which is significantly  higher than the OEMs themselves.

We look forward to more such  transactions as we further scale up our investment focus towards this sector.”    RK Behera, Chairman and Managing Director, RSB Group said “We are pleased to have partnered with  an organisation of such repute as being a funder of choice in the market today. This investment has  provided us with a long-term solution to our capital requirements.

I am very happy to be associated with a company  that believes in innovation and is backed with strong consumer research.

15-Mar-2017,"Piramal Swasthya and National Health Mission (NHM), Govt. of Assam partnership: Citizen Health Consultations and Services for Vulnerable and Remote Communities Reach Nearly 2 crore Mark","   Piramal Swasthya and National Health Mission (NHM), Govt. of Assam   partnership: Citizen Health Consultations and Services for Vulnerable and               Remote Communities Reach Nearly 2 crore Mark      India, Guwahati, March 15, 2017: Piramal Swasthya Management and Research  Institute, an initiative under the aegis of Piramal Foundation, has been a strategic partner  with the National Health Mission (NHM) and Government of Assam to provide affordable and  accessible healthcare to the most vulnerable sections of the community.    Piramal Swasthya is a leading not-for-profit organization in Remote Health Advisory and  Intervention and Community Outreach Programs in India. In Assam, the focused  journey began in 2010 with the objective to improve access and reach of quality primary  health services. Piramal Swasthya co-created and pioneered the 104 Health Information  Helpline platform and subsequently added the Assam Mother & Child Tracking System  (MCTS) i.e. an outbound call centre for tracking and monitoring pregnant mothers and  children. The Remote Health Advisory and Intervention platform continues to innovate with  seamless addition of high impact interventions like India’s first National AIDS Helpline  1097 which became operational on behalf of NACO. The synergy with Govt. of Assam  deepened further in 2011 with the launch of “Sanjeevani” - the first of its kind robust, cost  effective and scalable Village Health Outreach Program (VHOP).    Speaking about the deepening relationship with the Govt. of Assam, Vishal  Phanse, CEO, Piramal Swasthya said, “Piramal Swasthya aims to transform India’s  health ecosystem through high impact solutions, partnerships and thought leadership.  Assam is one of the most proactive states in the country to have demonstrated thought  leadership in using the Public Private Partnership model to achieve transformation at scale  in positively improving the State’s health outcomes. Piramal Swasthya, with its value  system and expertise, has aligned itself to this “transformation at scale” vision and the  thought leadership of the Honorable Health Minister of Assam. The way ahead is to replicate  the learnings and innovate at scale.”    Program Details:    The Sanjeevani Village Health Outreach Programme aims at early identification and  treatment of Chronic Diseases like Hypertension, Diabetes, Defective Vision, Epilepsy,  Asthma, Tuberculosis and Malaria. It also addresses the acute shortage of doctors and  specialists in the rural areas of Assam through a robust referral management system and  integration with 104 health information and MCTS helplines. Sanjeevani operates a fleet of  80 Mobile Medical Units (MMU) reaching out to over 3,700 villages in 32 districts of the  state, covering a population of over 62 lakh which is about 1/3rd of the entire rural  population of Assam. These vans provide integrated services for disease identification,  screening, diagnosis, monitoring and treatment, follow up and referral of high risk cases.  Since its launch, Sanjeevani has provided more than 52 lakh services, through more than  240 paramedics, to the people of Assam. So far, over 1.20 Lakhs diabetics and 95 thousand  hypertension patients have been under the disease management of the program.  Sanjeevani has now emerged as a robust platform that can be effectively leveraged further  by Piramal Swasthya and Govt. of Assam.    The 24x7 Sarathi Help Information Helpline (104) has been successfully operating in  Assam for over six years and addresses the challenge of poor access to timely health advice  and information. It has received over 1.15 crore calls so far and provides services such as  medical advice, psychological counselling, ASHA helpline, health services information  directory and a service improvement registry. In order to ensure that patients receive  uniform and consistent diagnosis and treatment, the helpline uses a Clinical Decision  Support System (CDSS) using more than 85 Algorithms and 640+ Disease Summaries,  developed by Piramal Swasthya.    The Assam Mother & Child Tracking System (MCTS) call centre initiative facilitates  timely delivery of antenatal and postnatal care services to pregnant women and  immunisation to children. Till date nearly 23 lakh calls have been made to beneficiaries.    Piramal Swasthya has partnered with NACO to achieve goals of the fourth phase of the  National HIV/AIDS Control Programme (NACP IV) that are aligned with the government’s  12th Five-Year-Plan. Till date, over 1.82 lakh calls in Assam have been addressed.

Strong profitability was mainly on account of improved top-line performance, partly offset by        increase in interest expense, depreciation and higher tax rate.                                                                                                                                  Page 2 of 5  Interest Expenses    Interest expense for the Q3 FY2017 and 9M FY2017 was higher primarily on account of increase in  debt for making investments under Financial Services business and partly for the acquisitions carried  out in Pharma business.

Ivanhoé  Cambridge is allocating an initial US$250m for this purpose. PEL will commit an  additional amount alongside and co-invest between 25% and 50% of each  transaction.    There is a strong demand for equity in the capital stack as blue chip real estate  developers increasingly prefer the option of partnering with investors in the early  stages of the development life cycle over high cost financing. Naturally, the  capital will be made available to a selective list of Grade A developers who have  already demonstrated a track record of execution capability, corporate  governance and strong return potential. The investment focus shall include the  Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Delhi (NCR), Bangalore, Pune and Chennai.    Ajay Piramal, Chairman, Piramal Enterprises Limited said, “We are  extremely pleased to be partnering with Ivanhoé Cambridge, a global  institutional leader of great reputation with a long term value system and  investing philosophy aligned with our own. Given the scale of our existing real  estate offering and roster of existing developer relationships, the partnership will  enable us to execute on very compelling opportunities to deliver high quality  residential developments in the local markets that we service.”    Khushru Jijina, Managing Director, Piramal Fund Management said, “This  alliance with Ivanhoé Cambridge is consistent with our philosophy of acting as a  perpetual provider of capital and underlines the confidence reposed by  institutional investors time and again in our abilities as a fiduciary. We believe  that the timing is opportune for the provision of both pure and preferred equity  capital at an early stage in the project life cycle. Such equity funding with Tier 1  development partners will enable us to deploy capital over a longer time horizon  and facilitate participation in larger projects with the ability to generate returns  across real estate cycles.”   Michael Sabia, President and Chief Executive Officer, CDPQ, said: “India   represents a key market for our global growth. We look forward to a long-term   and fruitful business relationship with Piramal in the years to come.”     Daniel Fournier, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ivanhoé   Cambridge said: “We are excited to participate in India’s success story   alongside one of India’s leading fund manager.

05-Jan-2017,Piramal Enterprises Limited announces its plan to Enter Housing Finance,"Piramal Enterprises Limited announces its plan to Enter Housing  Finance        Piramal Finance Limited („PFL‟), a 100% subsidiary, to apply to National       Housing Bank for incorporating a housing finance company („HFC‟) as       its subsidiary      Leverage existing strength in wholesale funding to diversify into retail       finance    Thursday, 5th January 2017, Mumbai: At a Board Meeting held earlier today, Piramal  Enterprises Limited announced plans to enter the retail housing finance market. The  Board of Directors has given its approval for Piramal Finance Ltd to make an application  to the National Housing Bank (NHB) for incorporating a Housing Finance Company (HFC)  as its subsidiary.    Piramal Finance Limited (“PFL”) already has a long standing presence in wholesale  finance, catering to the entire spectrum of financing needs across real estate (both  residential and commercial) as well as non-real estate (operating infrastructure and  other sectors) sectors with a current overall loan book extending to INR 19,170cr. In  addition, the Group also acts in a fiduciary capacity managing external funds with an  AUM of INR 7,315cr, including alliances with leading global investors.    The existing suite of products for real estate underlines PFL‟s ability to cater to the entire  capital stack, i.e. from early stage equity until later stage debt / construction finance for  residential and both mezzanine / structured debt as well as lease rental discounting for  commercial. Individual housing loans, therefore, are both a diversification strategy as well as  a natural extension of its business, completing its suite of products with an offering for the  retail customer segment.    Ajay Piramal, Chairman, Piramal Enterprises Limited said, “Having successfully scaled  up our presence in wholesale finance through Piramal Finance Limited, we believe that we  have established a blueprint for growth within the real estate asset class. We therefore, feel  that the timing is opportune for us to make a foray into retail housing finance. We would  naturally stand to benefit from our existing relationships with our development partners and  our ability to extend the tenure of our relationship from financing construction of the project  to the funding the individual home buyer.”    Khushru Jijina, Managing Director, Piramal Finance Limited said, “Having consolidated  our presence in the wholesale finance segment, we are excited to extend our services into  retail home finance. The scale of our relationships and existing investments across 300+  projects with 100+ development partners will enable us to hit the ground running.”    Retail housing as an asset class has always been representative of the significant economic  potential demonstrated by India‟s growing middle class with the individual home loan  segment tracking healthy growth. Given a fundamental underlying demand for urban housing  coupled with increasing affordability amongst a growing working class, the long term outlook  for this business is attractive.

Gablofen® has also been approved for launch in 8 European markets.

Ajay Piramal, Chairman, Piramal Enterprises Limited, commented on the acquisition, “We continue  to invest in the growth of our pharmaceutical businesses. This would be our 7th pharma acquisition in the  last two years, taking our investment for inorganic growth to Rs. 3,000 crores across our pharmaceutical  businesses. All these acquisitions are expected to be value accretive and will improve our pharmaceutical  segment’s growth and EBITDA in percentage and in absolute terms. This transaction is a step further in  our strategy to make investments, in both internal developments and acquisitions, to expand our presence  in the global generic hospital drug market, which is greater than US $20 billion in size. Through this  strategy, our focus continues to be the creation of long term value for shareholders.”    Peter DeYoung, CEO – Piramal Critical Care, added, “This is Critical Care’s second acquisition in the  last four months, following our acquisition of a portfolio of anesthesia and pain management injectable  drugs from Janssen Pharmaceutica NV. This acquisition provides Piramal a leadership position within the  intrathecal spasticity segment and the opportunity to access the intrathecal pain management market,  which is complementary to our critical care focus, and leverage our current operations and capabilities,  especially in the US. These acquisitions add branded products that are in attractive niches with barriers to  entry and limited competition. Along with our Inhalation Anesthesia products, we are building an exciting  portfolio to offer our customers and a substantially more diversified revenue base.”    Completion of the transaction is subject to HSR review in the US and certain other conditions.

29-Nov-2016,"Piramal Fund Management increases footprint in South India; crosses INR 10,000crore in consolidated investments","    Piramal Fund Management increases footprint in          South India; crosses INR 10,000crore in                 consolidated investments     -   Partners with select tier 1 developers to support their multi-city         portfolio in Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad    Tuesday, 29th November 2016, Bangalore / Chennai / Hyderabad: Piramal Fund  Management (PFM), the financial services arm of Piramal Group, has surpassed INR  10,000crore in aggregate investments from the proprietary book of Piramal Enterprises, in  South India. This milestone has been aided by a focused approach in treating Bangalore,  Hyderabad and Chennai as a single region, where synergies can be drawn from both existing  and new relationships with Tier 1 developers, and by leveraging its ability to sanction large  deals across the capital stack (Example: Adarsh Group - INR 1000cr, Ozone Group - INR  1050cr).    PFM’s three fold strategy to expand its product offerings, its portfolio companies and its  geographical reach, has enabled a steady growth of more than 80% CAGR in the last two  years. Building on the complementarities that exist in both marketing and execution across the  region, a number of tier 1 developers from Bangalore such as Prestige, Purvankara, Salarpuria  and Mantri, have forayed into Chennai and Hyderabad. As a natural progression and extending  the existing relationships with many of these tier 1 developers, PFM is actively underwriting  transactions across multiple projects with the same developers who have now entered other  cities in south.    Khushru Jijina, Managing Director, Piramal Fund Management said, “Piramal Fund  Management is committed to enabling liquidity in the ecosystem and as markets consolidate,  we will extend our partnerships in South India by underwriting multi-city portfolios with  existing and new Tier 1 developers. We have consistently increased our exposure across  Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad over the past few quarters. Consolidation is a healthy sign  which will make the end users recognize Tier 1 developer’s track record and execution  capabilities.”    “It has been a great experience working with Piramal Fund Management. They are one of the  first fund managers in the country that have the foresight to provide customized funding  solutions. Mr. Khushru Jijina and his team have exceptional insight and expertise due to their  experience in the field. They are innovative, ahead of the market and very reliable partners. I  would personally and highly recommend PFM to the Real Estate Sector.” said Bijay Agarwal,  Managing Director, Salarpuria Sattva Group    “Our relationship with PFM is fairly new and we are thoroughly impressed with their  professionalism, practical decision making approach stemming from the understanding of  specific requirements of developers and their speed in closing transactions. My personal  interaction with Mr. Jijina has been extremely positive and I am thrilled by his proactive  approach towards building relationships. We look forward to a long and mutually beneficial  association with PFM as we continue to develop the South region” said Sushil Mantri,  Managing Director, Mantri Developers  PFM’s exposure in the south extends across both the residential as well as the commercial  segment including a recently launched flexible Lease Rental Discounting (LRD) product as well  as customized funding for plotted land developments. The first phase of the Piramal Preferred  Partner program, under which a INR15,000cr line of credit was extended to select  developments has been 50% utilized at this stage and a second phase is likely to be launched  in FY’17 targeting, amongst others, selected developers in South India.

01-Nov-2016,Neuraceq Automated Synthesizer Synthera (Neuraceq Synthera) Received Shonin Approval in Japan,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                                                 Media Contacts:                                                                                 Nicole Fletcher                                                                                 Piramal Imaging                                                                                 nicole.fletcher@piramal.com                                                                                 +1 (857) 202-1122    Neuraceq Automated Synthesizer Synthera (Neuraceq自動合成装置  Synthera) Received Shonin Approval in Japan    Matran, Switzerland, November 1, 2016 ‒ Piramal Imaging S.A. today announced that  it has received Shonin (medical device) approval from the Ministry of Health, Labor and  Welfare (MHLW) of Japan for Neuraceq Automated Synthesizer Synthera (Neuraceq自動合成  装置 Synthera). The approval, obtained through Piramal Imaging’s service partner, SCETI  K.K., Tokyo, enables Japanese hospitals and imaging centers access to the equipment  needed for on-site manufacturing of the β-amyloid imaging agent florbetaben 18F, which is  approved in the EU, U.S. and South Korea under the brand name Neuraceq™.    “The availability of Neuraceq Automated Synthesizer Synthera (Neuraceq自動合成装置  Synthera) will contribute to further advance public health in Japan by assisting in the  diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia, a growing concern in the  Japanese society,” said Dr. Ludger Dinkelborg, Director of the Board, Piramal  Imaging. “In addition to expanding the market reach for Neuraceq™, the Shonin approval  for Neuraceq Automated Synthesizer Synthera (Neuraceq自動合成装置 Synthera) supports  our ambition of making this important diagnostic tool available on a global scale to the  expanding population facing dementia”, Dinkelborg added further.    Neuraceq Automated Synthesizer Synthera (Neuraceq自動合成装置 Synthera) is a medical  device manufactured by IBA, SA RadioPharma Solutions, Belgium. MHLW has approved the  device, IBA Synthera V2, as the manufacturing platform for the in-house production of  florbetaben 18F solution for Japanese hospitals. Florbetaben 18F, made on Neuraceq  Automated Synthesizer Synthera platform (Neuraceq自動合成装置 Synthera), is a  radioactive diagnostic agent approved in Japan for visualization of brain beta-amyloid  plaques in patients with cognitive impairment suspected to have Alzheimer’s disease.    Florbetaben 18F binds to neuritic beta-amyloid plaques in the human brain, a hallmark  characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, a condition that slowly destroys memory and cognitive  abilities and currently affects over 46 million people worldwide1. Until today, an estimated  20-30% of patients with dementia2 have been misdiagnosed and often experience extended  diagnostic episodes before receiving a clinical diagnosis. A definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's  disease can only be made after death based on autopsy findings of beta-amyloid plaques  and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain.

Recently, Piramal Imaging submitted a Summary Technical Document (STED) medical  device dossier to the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) seeking approval  for Neuraceq Automated Synthesizer Synthera (Neuraceq自動合成装置 Synthera). Under  the Shonin approval process, Neuraceq Automated Synthesizer Synthera (Neuraceq自動合  成装置 Synthera) is approved as a radioactive-material medical-treatment instrument  (category: Equipment 10), with the general designation of radiopharmaceutical synthetic  equipment (70009000), Class III. The device is to be distributed to Japanese hospitals by  SCETI K.K., Tokyo, who will also train hospital personnel on its use.    About Neuraceq™ (florbetaben F18 injection)    Indication Neuraceq™ is indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of the  brain to estimate beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density in adult patients with cognitive  impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other causes of  cognitive decline.    A negative Neuraceq™ scan indicates sparse to no amyloid neuritic plaques and is  inconsistent with a neuropathological diagnosis of AD at the time of image acquisition; a  negative scan result reduces the likelihood that a patient's cognitive impairment is due to  AD. A positive Neuraceq™ scan indicates moderate to frequent amyloid neuritic plaques;  neuropathological examination has shown this amount of amyloid neuritic plaque is present  in patients with AD, but may also be present in patients with other types of neurologic  conditions as well as older people with normal cognition.    Neuraceq™ is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations.    Limitations of Use          A positive Neuraceq™ scan does not establish the diagnosis of AD or any other         cognitive disorder.        Safety and effectiveness of Neuraceq™ have not been established for:            o   Predicting development of dementia or other neurologic conditions;            o   Monitoring responses to therapies.    Important Safety Information          Risk for Image Interpretation and Other Errors Neuraceq™ can be used to         estimate the density of beta-amyloid neuritic plaque deposition in the brain.         Neuraceq™ is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations. Neuraceq™ images should         be interpreted independent of a patient's clinical information. Physicians should         receive training prior to interpretation of Neuraceq™ images. Following training,         image reading errors (especially false positive) may still occur. Additional         interpretation errors may occur due to, but not limited to, motion artifacts or         extensive brain atrophy.        Radiation Risk Administration of Neuraceq™, similar to other         radiopharmaceuticals, contributes to a patient´s overall long-term cumulative         radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an         increased risk of cancer. It is important to ensure safe handling to protect patients         and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure.        Most Common Adverse Reactions In clinical trials, the most frequently observed         adverse drug reactions in 872 subjects with 978 Neuraceq™ administrations were         injection/application site erythema (1.7%), injection site irritation (1.2%), and         injection site pain (3.9%).

The products to be acquired are five injectable  versions of well-established Janssen brands, Sublimaze (fentanyl citrate), Sufenta  (sufentanil citrate), Rapifen (alfentanil hydrochloride), Dipidolor (piritramide), and  Hypnomidate (etomidate) (the “Products”).    Piramal has agreed to acquire the brand names and all related IP as associated with the  Products, including the know-how to make both the active pharmaceutical ingredients  (“API”) and the finished dosage forms of the Products. The Products are currently  marketed in over 50 countries. The potential acquisition does not include the transfer of  any manufacturing facilities or employees. As part of the transaction, Janssen will  continue to supply finished dosage forms for up to three years and API for up to five  years.

Commenting on the occasion, Ajay Piramal, Chairman, Piramal Enterprises said,  “Healthcare is an important focus area for Piramal Enterprises and we are strongly  committed to growing this segment. The healthcare segment has grown at 17% CAGR  over the last five years. This would be our 6th healthcare acquisition in the last two  years, inorganically investing Rs. 1,800 crores across our Healthcare businesses. This  acquisition is critical in shaping our product offerings, providing access to global markets  and leveraging our existing capabilities. This acquisition is an important step in enabling  Piramal Critical Care to start to address the global generic injectable hospital drug  market which is greater than US$20 billion in size. At Piramal, we constantly focus on  creating long term value for our shareholders.”    Peter DeYoung, CEO – Piramal Critical Care said, “We are currently the third largest  player in the Inhalation Anesthesia market globally and continue to grow in that niche  segment. These injectable anesthesia and pain products are a terrific addition to our  existing portfolio that will allow us to provide greater value to our customers leveraging  our existing organisation and distribution partners. Four of the acquired products are  controlled substances which have higher barriers to entry. Once the business is fully  transitioned to us, our customers and business partners will benefit from our broader  product basket, and in turn we can grow the value of the acquired product portfolio  through our team’s focused sales and marketing efforts. We remain committed to pursue  additional value enhancing organic and inorganic opportunities in the future. ”    The completion of the transaction is not subject to any further regulatory approvals.

Ltd today  announce the companies have entered into a strategic partnership and licensing agreement to provide  PET Pharm Biotech with exclusive rights to manufacture, market, and distribute NeuraCeq (florbetaben  F18 injection), throughout Taiwan. Neuraceq is a radiopharmaceutical tracer for Positron Emission  Tomography (PET) imaging of patients being evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other causes of  cognitive impairment.    Alzheimer’s disease, a condition that slowly destroys memory and cognitive abilities, currently affects  more than 190,000 people in Taiwan according to Taiwan’s Consumers Foundation. Until today, an  estimated 20-30% of patients with dementia have been misdiagnosed and often experienced extended  diagnostic episodes before receiving a clinical diagnosis.1 Historically, a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's  disease could only be made after death based on autopsy findings of beta-amyloid plaques and  neurofibrillary tangles in the brain after death. Today, a comprehensive clinical evaluation in combination  with in-vivo biomarkers, such as beta-amyloid PET imaging, improves the diagnostic accuracy while the  patient is still alive, allowing for optimal patient management and better health outcomes.    “We are confident that our commitment to providing access to diagnostic beta-amyloid radiotracers in  Taiwan will have a significant impact on the management of patients suspected of having Alzheimer’s  disease,” said Chih-Hao K. Kao, Chairman of the Board of Directors at PET Pharm Biotech. “In the context  of evidence-based medicine, the introduction of NeuraCeq in the marketplace will offer a new clinical  evaluation method for patients, physicians and caregivers alike in the diagnosis and management of  Alzheimer’s disease. It could potentially help identify more efficacious interventions to help prevent, halt  or slow down this terrible disease. PET Pharm Biotech is currently applying for a marketing authorization  with the Taiwanese FDA.”    “Piramal Imaging continues to expand its manufacturing and distribution network to bring NeuraCeq into  new markets,” said Ludger Dinkelborg, Member of the Board, Piramal Imaging. “The partnership with PET  Pharm Biotech demonstrates our commitment to further expanding our global presence and increasing  access to beta-amyloid PET scanning for imagers and referring physicians to advance the accuracy of  clinical diagnosis in Alzheimer’s disease.”                                                                                            US-FBB-0816-0136v1.5  About NeuraCeq (florbetaben F18 injection)    Indication  Neuraceq™ is indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of the brain to estimate beta-  amyloid neuritic plaque density in adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for  Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other causes of cognitive decline.    A negative Neuraceq™ scan indicates sparse to no amyloid neuritic plaques and is inconsistent with a  neuropathological diagnosis of AD at the time of image acquisition; a negative scan result reduces the  likelihood that a patient's cognitive impairment is due to AD. A positive Neuraceq™ scan indicates  moderate to frequent amyloid neuritic plaques; neuropathological examination has shown this amount  of amyloid neuritic plaque is present in patients with AD, but may also be present in patients with other  types of neurologic conditions as well as older people with normal cognition.    Neuraceq™ is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations.    Limitations of Use      • A positive Neuraceq™ scan does not establish the diagnosis of AD or any other cognitive          disorder.      • Safety and effectiveness of Neuraceq™ have not been established for:          o Predicting development of dementia or other neurologic conditions;          o Monitoring responses to therapies.    Important Safety Information    Risk for Image Interpretation and Other Errors  Neuraceq™ can be used to estimate the density of beta-amyloid neuritic plaque deposition in the brain.  Neuraceq™ is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations. Neuraceq™ images should be interpreted  independent of a patient's clinical information. Physicians should receive training prior to interpretation  of Neuraceq™ images. Following training, image reading errors (especially false positive) may still occur.  Additional interpretation errors may occur due to, but not limited to, motion artifacts or extensive brain  atrophy.    Radiation Risk  Administration of Neuraceq™, similar to other radiopharmaceuticals, contributes to a patient´s overall  long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with  an increased risk of cancer. It is important to ensure safe handling to protect patients and health care  workers from unintentional radiation exposure.    Most Common Adverse Reactions  In clinical trials, the most frequently observed adverse drug reactions in 872 subjects with 978  Neuraceq™ administrations were injection/application site erythema (1.7%), injection site irritation  (1.2%), and injection site pain (3.9%).                                                                                         US-FBB-0816-0136v1.5  About Piramal Imaging SA  Piramal Imaging SA, a division of Piramal Enterprises, Ltd., was formed in 2012 with the acquisition of  the molecular imaging research and development portfolio of Bayer Pharma AG.

01-Sep-2016,"In the largest debt transaction within the real estate funding space, Piramal Fund Management invests Rs 2,320 crore in Lodha Group’s Projects","  In the largest debt transaction within the real estate funding  space, Piramal Fund Management invests Rs 2,320 crore in Lodha                           Group’s Projects    September 1 2016; Mumbai: Piramal Fund Management (PFM), one of the largest real  estate focused fund & funding platforms and part of Piramal Enterprises, has invested Rs  2,320 crore across a bouquet of several projects of Lodha Group in Mumbai. This is the  single largest debt transaction to take place in the real estate funding space. Lodha  Group has been India’s largest real estate developer by sales for four consecutive years.  This is the second investment by PFM in the Lodha Group. Earlier, PFM had invested Rs  425 crore in Lodha Venezia, an advanced stage project in Mumbai.    PFM has committed Rs 2,320 crore across multiple projects to replace various existing  debts. This funding will enable Lodha to complete and deliver marquee projects in South  & Central Mumbai. The invested projects are at various stages of advanced construction  and completion with established sales and locked-in receivables. The deal has been  structured as a fixed return debt investment with periodic coupon payments and has an  appropriate security mechanism in place, including hard asset cover as well as an escrow  of receivables.    Lodha Group has a track record of robust business performance and an ability to produce  high quality products across different market segments. The group recorded gross sales  of over Rs 8,000 crore in FY 15-16, sustaining market leadership and unparalleled  growth across market cycles. As a result of this transaction, Lodha will not only be able  to complete and deliver its marquee projects on time, but also reduces its cost of funds  which will have a significant positive impact on its bottomline.    PFM is uniquely capable of catering to the entire capital stack – right from early stage  equity to late stage debt and construction finance and is therefore able to act as a  perpetual provider of capital for the real estate development life cycle. PFM also recently  announced the ‘Piramal Preferred Partner’ programme whereby its selected existing  development partners are allowed to draw from a pre-sanctioned limit in order to pursue  opportunistic acquisitions.    Mr. Khushru Jijina, Managing Director, Piramal Fund Management said: “I am  pleased to have furthered our relationship with the Lodha Group. This transaction  demonstrates our ability and willingness to scale our financing relationships with our  choice of partners and stands testament to the marketing and execution track record  demonstrated by Abhishek Lodha, MD, Lodha Group. The use of proceeds will ensure  completion of what we believe to be marquee projects in Central and South Mumbai.”    Mr. Abhishek Lodha, Managing Director, Lodha Group said: “PFM’s holistic  approach to real estate financing creates a win-win for both parties in terms of quantum  and cost. Khushru Jijina, MD, Piramal Fund Management has extensive domain  knowledge and has played a key role in consummation of this deal in record time. We  are seeing momentum building up in our business with sales, deliveries and collections  all moving up. This transaction will further strengthen our balance sheet and give us  room to further improve our growth. We are pleased to have deepened our relationship  with PFM and look forward to a long-term engagement with them.”    About Piramal Enterprises Limited  Piramal Enterprises Limited (PEL) is one of India’s large diversified companies, with a presence in Healthcare,  Healthcare Information Management and Financial Services.

This potential transaction is expected to be completed by the  end of August.    Located in Riverview, Michigan, Ash Stevens has over 50 years of experience in contract  manufacturing, and serves several biotech, mid-size pharma, and large pharmaceutical clients  worldwide.

Operating Profit    Operating profit for Q1 FY2017 was 174% higher at Rs.638 Crores, primarily driven by strong  revenue growth and fall in R&D expenses, partly offset by higher employee benefit expenses.  OPBITDA margin was higher at 36% in Q1 FY2017 as compared with 17% in Q1 FY2016.    Net Profit    Net Profit for Q1 FY2017 was 36% higher at Rs. 231 Crores. Strong profitability was mainly on  account of improved top-line performance, lower R&D expenses and higher share of income from  associates, partly offset by increase in interest expense and depreciation.

Financial Services    Income from Financial Services was 98% higher at Rs.635 Crores for Q1 FY2017. The growth in  income was primarily driven by increase in size of Loan Book.

Company has delivered a strong revenue performance with growth across all three        business segments. 58% of our Q4 FY2016 revenues and 61% of our FY2016 revenues were earned in        foreign currency.          Operating Profit          Operating profit for Q4 FY2016 was 141% higher at Rs.468 Crores, primarily driven by strong revenue        performance across most of our businesses during the quarter and fall in R&D expenses. OPBITDA        margin was higher at 27% in Q4 FY2016 as compared with 15% in Q4 FY2015.          Operating profit for FY2016 was 111% higher at Rs.1,872 Crores. R&D expenses were lower during the        period on account of scaling back of our investments in NCE research in FY2015. OPBITDA margin was        higher at 28% in FY2016 as compared with 17% in FY2015.            Net Profit          Net Profit for Q4 FY2016 was up by 89% at Rs.180 Crores as compared to Rs.95 Crores in Q4 FY2015.        Healthy profitability was mainly on account of improved performance across business segments and lower        R&D expenses. Net Profit for FY2016 was Rs.951 Crores                                                                                                                           Page 2 of 7  Interest Expenses    Interest expense for the Q4 FY2016 and FY2016 were higher primarily on account of increase in debt for  making investments under Financial Services segment.    Exceptional Gain / Loss    Exceptional net gain was Rs.72 Crores during Q4 FY2016 primarily on account of sale of certain  properties. In Q4 FY2015, the exceptional gain was Rs.4 Crores.

It’s our way of celebrating this city by rejoicing art, culture and its rich legacy”.    Highlights:     -   Ray by Subodh Gupta: Subodh Gupta’s majestic sculpture entitled “Ray” that is also a metaphor for       India. The nation state, in its idealized form, is the large bucket poised at the top, from where a       fountain of subjects pours forth. These subjects come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, but all       work together to hold up the nation state, to support its principals and ideals. The people are the       foundation of a nation, it is their strength and energy that allow the concept of the nation to exist, to       mold it into a vision which mirrors their diversity. The artist uses the most humble of materials, the       stainless steel kitchenware that is found in virtually every home in India, to convey his vision, his       hopes and aspirations which he shares with every Indian.   -   Byculla Soufflé: In an inspiration to celebrate the rich history of South Mumbai, “The Byculla Soufflé”       is a dance, light and sound show by Shiamak Davar’s troupe. ""The Byculla Soufflé"" is also a much       known Edwardian dish. The dish was a pride of the Byculla Club in Bombay. It was a sweet mousse in       which layers of cream are flavoured with different liqueurs. The recipe is in the book dated 1880 - The       Byculla Club, 1833-1916, a history by Samuel T. Sheppard. It was served to the elite both British and       Indians at the Club in many great celebrations. You can taste the Byculla Soufflé at the Aranya       Experience Centre and see the Aranya Show Flats on the 9th floor of Piramal Towers   -   Little Sultan & Little Badshah: These are mini toy trains designed to remind people of the rich       history of Thane & Byculla. Thane was the terminus for the first ever passenger train in India. On 16       April 1853, the passenger train service was inaugurated between Victoria Terminus and Thane.       Covering a distance of 34 km), it was hauled by three locomotives one of which was name “The       Sultan” which is now in the National Railway Museum. Inspired by this epic journey which celebrated       the importance of Thane we are creating “The Little Sultan” a locomotive a reminder of Mumbai’s s rich       history. Little Badshah is a tribute to philanthropist David Sassoon and other leading business men –       The Badshahs of Bombay who contributed to many important landmarks in Mumbai city.   -   Themed Gardens: After two successful flower shows in Mahableshwar and Vaikunth Thane, an       attempt is being made to grow flowers in the heart of Mumbai. In the midst of a concrete jungle and       the hustle and heat of Mumbai, flowers remind you of an innate connection with nature and provide       bursts of life and colours of the spring festival   -   Piramal Art Museum showcasing “A Painter Prince: Raja Ravi Varma Collection”: An exclusive       exhibit showcasing the works of Raja Ravi Varma at Piramal Museum of Art. Raja Ravi Varma was an       Indian artist from the princely state of Travancore, Kerala who achieved recognition for his depiction of       scenes from the epics of the Mahabharata and Ramayana. His paintings are considered to be among       the best examples of the fusion of Indian traditions with the techniques of European academic art.       Varma's paintings became an important motif in of the time, reproductions being found in almost       every Indian home. His exposure in the west came when he won the first prize in the Vienna Art       Exhibition in 1873. He is considered among the greatest painters in the history of Indian art. His work       brings together artwork from a variety of time periods in Ravi Varma’s life and from different parts of       the country that he visited in search of patronage and inspiration.   -   The Main Street: The Main Street is an event space for the festival where jazz music, dance and light       shows celebrating the Aranya Festival will take place. At night, the Elektra Light festival with giant       lights of feathers reminiscent of the Krishna himself will help to celebrate the festival of spring- the       harvest bringing resurgence, revival and a fresh new spirit                                                            ****  About Piramal Aranya:    Piramal Aranya is Piramal Realty’s signature project located in Byculla.

It is currently launched in two markets of Southern India namely  – Chennai & Coimbatore. Throatsil comes in a unique spray format which helps reach back of the  throat. It has a 3 in 1 Action that gives relief from throat pain, fights throat infection and soothes  cough. The product contains Amylmetacresol BP & 2 and 4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol which helps  reduce infection in the throat and Benzocaine which is like a local anesthetic commonly used as a  topical pain reliever or in cough drops.    Kedar Rajadnye – President & Chief Operating Officer, Consumer Products Division,  Piramal Enterprises said “We have always believed that the consumer is empowered to take  his/her own decision. Our products in the OTC category essentially target the problem solving  space and help the consumer solve problems that disrupts their day-to-day lives. Our recent  launch – Throatsil caters to the unmet need for sore throat relief in the self-care space.  Environmental changes, pollution and contamination of air have led to frequent throat infections.  Throatsil will help consumers achieve quick recovery and return to their regular lifestyle.”    **Increasing levels of air pollution and spread of infections in an urban lifestyle are known to be  some of the main reasons for various respiratory infections. Exposure to particulate matter can  cause sore throat pain, which causes irritation, and can cause mild discomfort to severe pain in  throat. The National Ambient Air Quality Standard for PM10 for residential, industrial and rural  areas is 55 ug/m3. However, the same level for Chennai and Coimbatore was found to be higher,  at 67. 72 ug/m3. This study and research has led to the test launch of Throatsil in these cities.    “Our study and research shows that Tamil Nadu is second largest state in India affected with  throat infections. Hence, we have chosen two cities in the state – Chennai and Coimbatore to  conduct our test launch.” added Kedar.    Throstsil’s simple packaging i.e. spray format and light weight bottle makes it handy for traveling  purpose. Throatsil is available at an MRP 149 for 45ml in menthol flavour.

23-Feb-2016,Piramal Fund Management launches novel ‘Piramal Preferred Partner’ program; intends to pre-sanction funding limits for chosen Tier 1 developers to pursue acquisitions; targets funding commitments of I,"Piramal Fund Management launches novel ‘Piramal Preferred  Partner’ program; intends to pre-sanction funding limits for  chosen Tier 1 developers to pursue acquisitions; targets funding  commitments of INR15,000cr in the first phase    Wednesday, 23rd February 2016, Mumbai: Piramal Fund Management (“PFM”) has  announced the „Piramal Preferred Partner‟ program whereby it‟s selected existing  development partners are allowed to draw from a pre-sanctioned limit in order to  pursue opportunistic acquisitions. PFM intends to commit an amount of INR15,000cr in  the first phase of this program to a select group of existing relationships.    By making capital available at an earlier stage, the developers would be able to focus  on their core competence i.e. originating the best transactions available in this  marketplace without worrying about their external financing requirements which  typically tend to distract them from the project specific underwriting. As a result of  our pre-approved limits, the developers will be able to close their choice of  transactions much faster. Naturally, this facility would be extended to a selective list  of developers who have already demonstrated both the strength of balance sheet as  well as the execution capability required for the intended end use. The limit itself  would also be arrived at keeping in mind various other organization and project  specific parameters and would be reset on a periodic basis.    In keeping with the platform‟s philosophy, this line would be fungible across the entire  suite of funding and financing options that the Platform is capable of extending – right  from early stage equity to senior secured debt / construction finance and even a  structured bulk purchase of individual units.    Khushru Jijina, Managing Director, Piramal Fund Management said, “This is a  concept that was borne out of the relationship driven approach that we have always  exhibited with our development partners. We were already prevalent across the entire  capital stack and able to act as a perpetual provider of capital for multiple projects. By  offering this facility, our development partners will always be able to demonstrate a  competitive advantage as against their peer group.”    About Piramal Enterprises Limited  Piramal Enterprises Limited (PEL) is one of India‟s large diversified companies, with a presence  in healthcare, healthcare information management and financial services.

It is up to                  impacted the lives of over  corporate foundations like ours to provide the risk capital in creating models that                  400 women  can be replicated further.    We also understand that as Piramal Foundation, our resources will never address  all problems across the country. Collaboration with like-minded partners can  create force multipliers and help make a dent on key social issues. It is with this  mindset that we have created strong partnerships with 10 state governments,  including Rajasthan, as also international organizations such as Michael & Susan  Dell Foundation, World Diabetes Foundation, McArthur Foundation, Harvard's GEII (Global Education Innovation  Initiative), New York University, Plan International, amongst others.    India has a large population, multiple cultures and uneven development. The problem can be addressed from multiple  perspectives. Our approach at the Piramal Foundation has been to break down the ‘life cycle’ of the problem and go  after one or two issues where we can cause disproportionate change. It brings focus to both, the strategy and the  execution.”      Dr. Swati Piramal, Vice Chairperson, Piramal Enterprises said:  “Most initiatives of the Foundation – clean drinking water, women’s empowerment, education – were initially piloted in  Bagar, District Jhunjhunu. We are privileged that these initiatives have now been replicated in different states of the  country and are being studied internationally. The investments made by the Piramal Foundation in its activities have  been supported by Piramal Enterprises Ltd and its subsidiaries as well as personal philanthropy of the Piramal family.     Our solutions are aimed at creating the ‘software’ for greater efficiency and quality, rather than only building hard  infrastructure. For instance, in education, the Piramal Foundation for Education Leadership focuses on building  leadership capacity which, in turn, has a positive impact on student learning outcomes. In Rajasthan, this approach  has helped PFEL deliver a 21% increase in learning outcomes in Maths and Language in 2014-15 across approx. 700  government schools, in partnership with the respective headmasters and education officials.    In the area of safe drinking water, we have worked with over 150 entrepreneurs in Rajasthan in deploying advanced  remote monitoring technology in community solutions to ensure safe drinking water in these villages. This patented  technology helps in bringing accountability and transparency to the purification and distribution process while creating  a self-sustaining business model for the entrepreneur.    Our engagement on primary healthcare in Rajasthan covers a 104 Health Helpline operated out of Jaipur, over 80  mobile medical units across 20 districts and operating 13 Primary Health Centres (the last in partnership with WISH  Foundation). Our technology enabled solutions help improve the access and availability of government healthcare  services to a rural population that is otherwise deprived of a vital support system.    Another supported initiative is Annamrita. To fight the problem of hunger and illiteracy the government of India  launched the mid-day meal scheme in 1994. The midday meal initiative was taken up by ISKCON Food Relief  Foundation in 2005 under the Annamrita banner. Piramal Foundation has supported the set-up of 2 central kitchens of  Annamrita. Operating across 8 states of India, it serves 1.2 million mid-day meals daily through 20 ISO certified  centers. Of this Piramal supports approx. 70,000 student meals.    Piramal Foundation is not new to philanthropy. In the 1930s, Seth Piramal Chaturbhuj Makharia, set up the state’s  first school for girls in Bagar, Dist Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan, which is operational till date. The first school child admitted  here was a harijan. The Piramal Group has demonstrated over the years that the ultimate driver of all social efforts  should not just be the redressal of an immediate problem, but also the building of a long-term sustainable ecosystem.  It is an opportune time for the corporate sector to step up and build capacity &apply long-practiced corporate  philosophies to effect change that is largely consensual, sustained and systemic.

17-Nov-2015,Piramal healthcare invests £2.0 mn in scotland,"PRESS RELEASE        PIRAMAL HEALTHCARE INVESTS £2.0 MN IN SCOTLAND        - Investment expected to add GBP 3-5 mn to global revenue  Mumbai, London; 17 November 2015: Piramal Healthcare UK Ltd., has invested £2.0 million  into Scotland to expand its manufacturing base at Grangemouth, to manufacture Antibody  Drug Conjugates to global markets. This new investment into Scotland will yield additional  revenue of £3-5 mn over 5 years to Piramal Healthcare’s revenues.    The announcement was made by the First Minister at Piramal’s new facility, where up to 20  new high-skill job roles will be created, backed by £200,000 Regional Selective Assistance  funding.    Last month’s launch of the industry-led Life and Chemical Sciences Manufacturing Strategy,  positioned Scotland as a globally competitive base for sustainable high-value  manufacturing. Piramal Healthcare is a key element to the antibody drug conjugate (ADC)  hub in Scotland and this further expansion is testament to Scotland’s attractiveness as a life  sciences manufacturing location.

Company has delivered a strong revenue performance with growth        across all three business segments. 62% of our Q2 FY2016 revenues and 63% of H1 FY2016        revenues were earned in foreign currency.          Operating Profit          Operating profit for Q2 FY2016 was 122% higher at Rs.476 Crores, primarily driven by strong        revenue performance across most of our businesses during the quarter and fall in R&D expenses.        R&D expenses were lower during the quarter on account of scaling back of our investments in NCE        research in FY2015. OPBITDA margin was higher at 31% in Q2 FY2016 as compared with 17% in        Q2 FY2015.          Operating profit for H1 FY2016 was 110% higher at Rs.776 Crores.

Page 2 of 7  Net Profit excluding exceptional items    Net Profit excluding exceptional items for Q2 FY2016 was at Rs.255 Crores as compared to Rs.41  Crores in Q2 FY2015. Healthy profitability was mainly on account of improved performance across  business segments and lower R&D expenses.    Net Profit excluding exceptional items for H1 FY2016 was at Rs.460 Crores as compared to Rs.97  Crores in H1 FY2015.      Interest Expenses    Interest expense for the Q2 FY2016 and H1 FY2016 was higher primarily on account of increase in  debt for making investments under Financial Services segment.    Exceptional Gain / Loss    Exceptional loss was Rs.9 Crores during Q2 FY2016. In Q2 FY2015, the exceptional loss was Rs.374  Crores on account scaling back of investments in NCE research.    Exceptional loss was Rs.12 Crores in H1 FY2016. Exceptional net gain of Rs.2,657 Crores in H1  FY2015 primarily included gain on sale of 11% stake in Vodafone India for Rs.8,900 Crores (an  Investment of Rs.5,864 Crores made in FY2012), partially offset by the amount written down on  account of scaling back of our investments in NCE research.    Share of Associates    Income under share of associates for the Q2 FY2016 and H1 FY2016 primarily includes our share in  the profits of Shriram Capital for the period.

Pharma Solutions  Revenues from Pharma Solutions business grew by 5% YoY to Rs.543 Crores in Q2 FY2016. Growth  rate for the Q2 FY2016 was moderate due to the lumpy nature of this business. In H1 FY2016,  revenues grew by 16% YoY to Rs.1,110 crores vs Rs.961 Crores in H1 FY2015. We successfully  integrated Coldstream facility and commenced investing in its capability & capacity expansion to take  benefit from rapidly growing outsourcing business in Sterile injectables. Formulation development  business witnessed good traction. Pithampur successfully cleared 3rd USFDA audit in less than a  year.

Critical Care  Revenues from Critical Care business grew by 19% YoY to Rs.208 Crores in Q2 FY2016 primarily on  account of increasing access to new markets, growth in our market share across geographies and  positive impact of INR depreciation. We became No.1 player in Isoflurane and increased sales  volume of Sevoflurane in the US market. Post our entry last year, our market share in UK increased  to 15%. We entered the markets of Malaysia and Iraq during the quarter.

Page 4 of 7  Consumer Products  Revenues from Consumer Products business were broadly in line at Rs.86 Crores in Q2 FY2016 and  Rs.178 Crores in H1 FY2016. High growth in most of our top brands was largely offset by temporarily  lower growth in i-pill and Saridon.    Saridon continues to maintain no. 1 rank in headache category. Lacto and i-pill maintains their  leadership positioning. We commenced exports of few brands to nearby countries that have a reach  of Indian media. We increased digital presence with an exclusive launch of Untox ™ with Snapdeal  during the quarter. We are expanding to towns with more than 20,000 population. Initially, we have  expanded in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.    Financial Services    Income from Financial Services was 82% higher at Rs.429 Crores for Q2 FY2016 and 75% higher at  Rs798 Crores for H1 FY2016.

Also, during the  quarter, we were recognized as the ‘Best Overall Investment Manager (India)’ by Euromoney in its  11th Annual Real Estate Survey 2015.      Information Management    Revenues from Information Management business grew by 23% YoY, to Rs.275 Crores in Q2  FY2016, primarily driven by growth in data and analytics products and the acquisition of HBI.

29-Sep-2015,Piramal targets becoming the global market leader in development & manufacturing of Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs),"FOR EMBARGOED RELEASE: SEPT29, 2015      Piramal targets becoming the global market leader in  development & manufacturing of Antibody Drug  Conjugates (ADCs)      Fifth anniversary of the first commercial ADC (Adcetris) sees Piramal      introduce ‘Proof of Concept’ service for next wave of ADC growth    29 September, 2015: Piramal Enterprises' Pharma Solutions division, a world  leader in contract development and manufacturing (CDMO), has set a target of becoming  the market leader in ADCs contract commercialization over the next five years**. This is  based on its focused investments at its current site in Grangemouth UK and its recent  acquisition of Coldstream – a specialised ADC fill/finish site, in Kentucky, USA.    The CDMO sees the market for commercial ADCs accelerating over the next few years  and a steady increase in number of potential drug targets entering into the clinical  phase. Piramal expects about eight drugs to move into its commercial production by  2020 which is a significant jump considering it only manufactures one commercial  product today. The CDMO suggests that despite the increase in development targets for  ADCs, the global contract manufacturing sector still remains significantly under  resourced with only a handful of players with experience and even less with the required  regulatory accreditations .  Piramal is now in its fifth year of commercial production on the first ever commercial  ADC in the market and is using this landmark to look ahead five-years to cement its  position as a leader in manufacturing of ADCs. Over the last decade, Piramal has  gradually expanded its internal teams and has nearly 150 ADCs specialists across its  global sites.    There are currently two commercialised ADCs on the market and Vivek Sharma, CEO –  Pharma Solutions, Piramal Enterprises, commented: “the situation with ADCs  mirrors what happened when Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs) first started to  commercialize. At present, very few CMOs have the facilities or, just as crucially, the  experience to develop them. At the moment there are only two CMOs, including  ourselves, which are leading the charge in the commercial manufacturing of ADCs.  Piramal is targeting winning at least one in every two commercial contracts coming to  market over the next few years”.    Piramal views the acquisition of Coldstream‟s fill finish site earlier this year as the final  piece in the jigsaw puzzle and is now bullish about its prospects in the market.  Present bottlenecks begin with the small number of quality CMOs that can bring a  product through clinical development. Second, the uneven spread of targets with most  currently in very early stage research. Recognising this, Piramal has introduced a new  „Proof of Concept‟ service, designed to bring the most promising targets into clinical  development more quickly.    Vivek Sharma adds: ”For a pharma client, working with Piramal is an efficient and  smart choice as we can take the product all the way from Proof of Concept to  commercial manufacture. We have worked on over 24 different products that include  fill/finish and conjugation technologies, and have the track record and the experience of  bringing a product to market. Our biotech and medium sized pharma clients understand  the benefits of working with an experienced partner and prefer to leverage our expertise,  instead of locking resources in developing the capabilities for ADC manufacturing in-  house.”    Research on ADC targets shows that there will be at least a further 50 entering clinical  work by 2020- over the next few years it is likely there will be a wave of consolidations  within the CDMO sector to acquire technology. Vivek Sharma comments: “We have  been in the ADC market for over 10 years, and it is an expertise we have built both  organically and inorganically. We see the next 5 years as an exciting time for the ADC  market and possibly have a sizeable contribution in the total Biological CMO market”..                                                 -- End –    ** all statement are subject to market-related or other unforeseen circumstances    About Piramal Enterprises Limited  Piramal Enterprises Limited (PEL) is one of India‟s large diversified companies, with a presence in  Healthcare, Healthcare Information Management and Financial Services.

28-Sep-2015,"Piramal Realty draws a strong customer response for its first project, Piramal Vaikunth in Balkum, Thane","Piramal Realty draws a strong customer response for its first project,  Piramal Vaikunth in Balkum, Thane  ~ 30% of Phase 1 inventory (INR400crore) sold-out on day 1    ~ Receives phenomenal response on the premium inventory    ~ Records over INR 200cr bookings in 5 days    September 28, 2015, Mumbai: Piramal Realty, the real estate development arm of Piramal  Group, launched its first project, Piramal Vaikunth located in Balkum, Thane recently. The phase 1  of the project included inventory over INR400crore between Sept 15 to Sept 27 with a special price  for premium inventory starting at INR 8640/- per-sq-feet.    On the day of the launch, the project received strong customer registrations; over 100units was  sold within 3-4 hours and 30% of phase 1 inventory sold out on the launch day.    Buyers had an option to select from 2 to 3 bedroom apartments to suit the needs of their families.  Over 350-400 people queued up at the sales center on day one to know more about the project  which will feature high-rises, townhouses, world-class amenities, a spiritual learning centre, and a  retail boulevard, all nestled in a 32-acre+ oasis.    Commenting on this sales’ response, Anand Piramal, Executive Director, Piramal Group said,  “In mid-September 2015, we launched Piramal Vaikunth in Thane where we planned to release  approx. INR 100cr worth of inventory i.e 75 units. However, the overwhelming response to our  launch compelled us to increase this to approx. INR 200cr worth of inventory, which was booked  within 5 days of pre-launch. In this sluggish real estate market, we sold premium residential units  which further reinforces our belief that quality real estate will always be valued.”    The project, a natural and holistic living complex is a mixed-use development designed by HOK,  the #1 ranked architecture/engineering firm by Engineering News-Record and Architectural Record.  It will additionally include a 60,000 sq. ft. community center that has amenities & services such as  a cafeteria, banquet hall, swimming pool, guest suites, library, business center, and indoor game  courts for basketball, badminton, gymnasium, squash, etc.  ",https://www.piramal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Piramal_Vaikunth_Post_Launch_Note_20150930081640-1-1.pdf,https://www.piramal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/logo.svg,Piramal
17-Sep-2015,Piramal encourages pharma to embrace green chemistry ahead of CPhI,"Piramal encourages pharma to embrace green chemistry  ahead of CPhI       Processes improvements for original patented products need to be       considered, as do improvements beyond even DMF and ANDA                               submission      17 September, 2015: Piramal Enterprises' Pharma Solutions division, a global leader in  contract development and manufacturing (CDMO), is calling on pharma companies to  start complementing the principles of Quality by Design (QbD) to advance product and  process quality. The CDMO believes it is imperative to improve the mechanism by which  drugs are discovered, developed, and even manufactured through advances in Process  Analytical Technology (PAT), and a commitment to continuous improvement by  implementing green chemistry earlier in the drug development cycle.    Piramal Pharma Solutions believes that far too often life sciences companies examine the  efficiency of the chemical processes used much too late in the drug development  process, if at all. It is widely accepted that over 100 kg of waste can be produced during  the manufacture of one kg of API or advanced intermediate.    In response, Piramal has launched a series of green chemistry initiatives and is  fundamentally asking all its partners to evaluate the greenness of the chemical pathways  (routes) they are using in any project.    There are two potential areas for implementing greener routes (processes) in drug  development: a) when the drug demonstrates efficacy, during Phase II, as the clinical  risk is reduced enough to consider putting R&D resources into developing a more  efficient and greener route; and b) Life Cycle Management (LCM), post-  commercialisation, where the onset of generic manufacture requires more efficient  processes to remain competitive.    Vivek Sharma, CEO – Pharma Solutions, Piramal Enterprises, comments: “Green  Chemistry by design (GCbD) presents us with a great opportunity to look at the bigger  picture during route scouting and move ahead with green chemistry principles. I am sure  that further down the line the FDA will look at bringing in these principles more formally,  but as an industry we should be taking action and doing this now. The routes used for  many drugs – whether generic or patented – are often atom inefficient and have  significant room for improvement using route scouting methodologies including GCbD  principles. We need to start the GCbD process early – not after a NDA or DMF has been  filed, but as early as Phase I for innovators and as early as NDA approval for Generic  players. This is where the Greener routes are established, after which they tend to  remain with the product through its life cycle, and that is where the fundamental change  needs to occur.”  The CDMO believes that, in the future, new chemistries for improved and greener routes  are urgently needed if the industry is to see the bigger picture of GCbD followed by  optimisation of these routes using QbD. Already, there are a number of tools available;  from changing the initial routes, using biocatalysis, flow systems and chemo catalysis,  and by implementing a key R&D function called “route scouting” The problem is that the  industry as a whole is still comfortable in trying the tested methods. A number of CMOs  – Piramal included – are developing new chemistries that enable greener routes using  GCbD principles but there needs to be a collective desire in pharma to improve its overall  greenness and efficiency. Ultimately, drugs could be produced significantly cheaper and  with green footprints.    As an example, Dr. Dhileepkumar Krishnamurthy, VP & Head R&D (API), Pharma  Solutions, Piramal Enterprises states that: “Piramal scientists re-designed the route  for a patented product during the development of a new generic, resulting in over a 25  fold improvement in efficiency– waste was reduced from 1500kg/kg down to under  50kg/kg. Even in the generic industry, where reducing cost is a key, re-examining routes  is not a regular occurrence prior to DMF filing. Therefore, we, as a collective industry,  need to invest in the investigating potential new routes for patented products that drive  atom efficiency and a step change reduction in costs, instead of doing incremental  improvements for a quick DMF and ANDA submission.”    Vivek Sharma, CEO – Pharma Solutions, Piramal Enterprises, continued: “At CPhI  Worldwide, Piramal is urging its partners and the wider industry to take up greener, and  often cost effective routes to market, as we believe that as an industry we have a  greater responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint while also assisting patients. In  what is largely unique to pharma, once approval is granted, there is little incentive for  continuous process improvement as regulatory hurdles present significant challenges to  rework routes. As an industry, we need to change this paradigm by investing in GCbD  principles, early and to drive cost effective and elegant chemical transformations.”    Piramal has instilled and nurtured a green culture over the last few years and is  currently exploring a number of new, green, chemical processes and at CPhI the  company will be looking for new partners to commercialise these waste-reduction  technologies.                                                -- End --      About Piramal Enterprises Limited  Piramal Enterprises Limited (PEL) is one of India’s large diversified companies, with a presence in  Healthcare, Healthcare Information Management and Financial Services.

11-Aug-2015,Piramal Healthcare launches Stop AllerG in the allergy segment,"  Piramal Healthcare launches Stop AllerG in the allergy segment         Developed by Piramal Healthcare Innovation Lab, this is the first OTC anti-                              allergy product in India      Ahmedabad, 11 August, 2015: Piramal Healthcare, one of the largest and fastest  growing players in the domestic consumer healthcare market has today launched ‘Stop  AllerG’, an anti-allergy OTC brand in Ahmedabad. Stop AllerG is a non-drowsy formula  that provides relief in minutes and helps consumers stay active even when they suffer  from symptoms such as watery eyes, watery nose, rapid sneezing and itchy throat.  Stop AllerG is available at MRP of Rs. 60 for 5 tablets.    The Central Pollution Board recently launched an Air Quality Index to help people  monitor the air quality by measuring the particulate matter in air. The particulate matter  in air is made up of a number of components, including acids (such as nitrates and  sulphates), organic chemicals, metals, soil or dust particles, and fragments of pollen or  mould spores. The National Ambient Air Quality Standard for PM10 for residential,  industrial and rural areas is 60 ug/m3. However, the same level for Ahmedabad was  found to be higher, at 67ug/m3.    Particulate Matter Level in Ahmedabad                             City/station             PM10 ug/m3                             National Standard        60                           Ahmedabad                67                                  Source: Ambient (outdoor) air pollution in cities database 2014    Exposure to particulate matter can cause symptoms even in healthy people such as  irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat; coughing; phlegm; chest tightness; and  shortness of breath. There is also a direct link between the size of particles and their  potential for causing health problems. While the larger particles can irritate eyes, nose  and throat ; it’s the small particles which are less than 10 micrometres in diameter which  pose more problems. Longer exposure to bad air lead to itchy eyes, troubled breathing,  and other symptoms which are synonymous with Allergies. Allergy is a hypersensitivity  disorder of the immune system of our body. Allergic reactions occur when a person’s  immune system reacts abnormally to normally harmless substances, present in the  environment. Studies have proven that 20-30% of the Indian population suffers from at  least one allergic disease, with 3.5% citizens suffering from allergic rhinitis*.    Mr. Kedar Rajadnye, COO – Consumer Products Division, Piramal Enterprises  said “Increasing industrialisation and reducing natural habitats has made combating  pollution a common consequence for all of us. Breathing air with high Particulate matter  brings its own problems and hence today a large set of consumers face respiratory  disorders. Symptoms such as watery eyes, watery nose, rapid sneezing and itchy throat  are quite common and can severely impact the normal routine for an individual.  Understanding this necessity, we in Piramal Healthcare Innovation Lab have developed  Stop AllerG. Stop AllerG is a non-drowsy formulation, which can provide relief in  minutes from the symptoms of allergy. We believe this is the product will helps  consumers bounce back to their life quite fast”    A recent independent survey conducted in Ahmedabad indicates that, 1 out of 3 people  surveyed suffer from runny nose, watery eyes, sneezing and itchy throat every month.  Almost 50% people feel that their daily work gets affected due to these symptoms. 41%  of people surveyed were not aware that these symptoms could be because of allergy.  While almost 2 out of 3 people either identified dust, pollution or pollen as the cause of  allergy, yet they did not differentiate cold from allergy. Of those who took self-  medication, 1 out of 3 take common cold medicines for symptoms like runny nose,  watery eyes, sneezing and itchy throat. Variations in climatic conditions and pollution  could be the triggers for such symptoms.      *Source: Indian J Chest Dis Allied Sci 2013; 55:7-8      About Consumer Products:  The Consumer Product division is one of the fastest growing players in the Domestic Consumer  Healthcare Market.

11-Aug-2015,Piramal Sarvajal Installs Water ATMs at L&T Realty’s Crescent Bay Bhoiwada Site,"      Piramal Sarvajal Installs Water ATMs at L&T Realty’s                    Crescent Bay Bhoiwada Site   More than 1700 labourers working with several contractors at L&T Realty’s                 site will have access to clean drinking water    Mumbai, 11th August, 2015: Piramal Sarvajal, part of Piramal Foundation has installed  Piramal Sarvajal‟s remote monitoring enabled purification technology, and also its  pioneering Water ATMs at L&T Realty‟s Crescent Bay Bhoiwada (Parel East, Mumbai)  construction site. The water purification system will cater to more than 1700 labourers at  the site.      Mr. Vasu Padmanabhan, CEO, Piramal Sarvajal said, “In India, 73 million working days  are lost due to water-borne diseases each year. There are more than 1700 labourers  working at L&T Realty‟s construction site Crescent Bay Bhoiwada, Mumbai. Their only source  of safe water for both drinking as well as cooking was water tankers, which were not  completely reliable with regards to quality and makes them susceptible to water borne  diseases.”    In India, approximately 125 million people lack access to safe and clean drinking water.  Nearly 75% of surface water is contaminated with bacteria. Almost 60% of the illnesses in  adults and 85% of illnesses in children is caused by contaminated water. According to a  UNICEF and FAO report, more than 1.5 million children every year succumb to preventable  water-borne diseases such as diarrhea and cholera. As a result, low-income families spend  15- 20% of their annual wages for treating water-borne diseases every year.    L&T Realty has installed Piramal Sarvajal‟s purification technology and also its pioneering  Water ATMs. The Water ATM is a solar powered dispensing device where the quality is  remotely monitored and it‟s operated by „smart‟ Water ATM cards that work using RFID  technology. L&T Realty ordered one 500LPH (litres per hour) 5-stage purification machine  (including RO, Reverse Osmosis, as well as UV, Ultraviolet filtration) along with 5 Water ATM  units in April 2015. Within 10 days of placing the order, the purification machine and 2  Water ATMs had been installed at the site and Water ATM cards have already been  distributed to labourers.    A senior spokesperson from L&T Realty said, “The safety and health of our labourers is  high priority for us. Since the installation of Piramal Sarvajal ATM at the site, we have seen  a significant rise in attendance, which is a result of the lesser number of sick days taken by  the workforce due to common water borne diseases.”        Total Volume Dispensed Daily from one Water ATM (first month of operation)  Source: Piramal Sarvajal.

A negative Neuraceq™ scan indicates sparse to no amyloid neuritic plaques and is inconsistent with a  neuropathological diagnosis of AD at the time of image acquisition; a negative scan result reduces the  likelihood that a patient's cognitive impairment is due to AD. A positive Neuraceq™ scan indicates  moderate to frequent amyloid neuritic plaques; neuropathological examination has shown this amount  of amyloid neuritic plaque is present in patients with AD, but may also be present in patients with other  types of neurologic conditions as well as older people with normal cognition.  Neuraceq™ is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations.  Limitations of Use   A positive Neuraceq™ scan does not establish the diagnosis of AD or any other cognitive disorder.   Safety and effectiveness of Neuraceq™ have not been established for:          o Predicting development of dementia or other neurologic conditions;          o Monitoring responses to therapies.    IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION    Risk for Image Interpretation and Other Errors  Neuraceq™ can be used to estimate the density of beta-amyloid neuritic plaque deposition in the brain.  Neuraceq™ is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations. Neuraceq™ images should be interpreted  independent of a patient's clinical information. Physicians should receive training prior to interpretation  of Neuraceq™ images. Following training, image reading errors (especially false positive) may still occur.                                                                                                  US-FBB-0615-0086  Additional interpretation errors may occur due to, but not limited to, motion artifacts or extensive brain  atrophy.    Radiation Risk  Administration of Neuraceq™, similar to other radiopharmaceuticals, contributes to a patient´s overall  long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with  an increased risk of cancer. It is important to ensure safe handling to protect patients and health care  workers from unintentional radiation exposure.    Most Common Adverse Reactions  In clinical trials, the most frequently observed adverse drug reactions in 872 subjects with 978  Neuraceq™ administrations were injection/application site erythema (1.7%), injection site irritation  (1.2%), and injection site pain (3.9%).

The results, which  were presented at the 2015 annual meeting of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging  (SNMMI) in Baltimore, Md., provide additional details on the topographic distribution of different beta-  amyloid aggregates in the brain and on quantification.    In one analysis, entitled, Impact of Morphologically Distinct Amyloid ß (Aß) Deposits on 18F-Florbetaben  (FBB) PET Scans, investigators examined florbetaben PET data to investigate the impact of diffuse,  neuritic, and vascular beta-amyloid deposits on different regions of interest in the brain. They collected  brain tissue samples from 87 end-of-life patients (including 64 with Alzheimer’s disease [AD], 14 with  other dementia, and 9 non-demented aged volunteers; mean age 80.4±10.2 years) who underwent a  florbetaben PET scan before death. In the frontal and posterior cingulate cortices – brain regions with  high frequency of deposits – both diffuse and neuritic beta-amyloid contributed significantly to 18F-  florbetaben uptake. In the occipital and anterior cingulate cortices – brain regions with low deposit  frequency – only diffuse beta-amyloid plaques contributed significantly to the uptake. The presence of  vascular beta-amyloid deposits contributed significantly to the uptake only in the occipital cortex.    “PET imaging using 18F-florbetaben as a radiotracer may allow for detection of morphologically distinct  beta amyloid deposits in the brain aside from neuritic plaques, and their distribution in different brain  regions. Further clinical studies are needed to elucidate how these deposits influence and contribute to  cognitive impairment and dementia,” commented co-author Ana M. Catafau, M.D., Ph.D., Vice President  of Clinical R&D Neurosciences at Piramal Imaging. ""Findings such as these may provide the requisite  detailed information to help researchers better understand the time course and contributions of  different types of plaque to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease and other types of cognitive  impairment.”  In a second analysis, Cerebellar Senile Plaques: How Frequent are They and Do They Influence 18F-  florbetaben SUVR?, researchers assessed the influence of cerebellar plaques on signal quantification  when the cerebellar cortex is used as a reference region for quantification. Cerebellar β-amyloid (Aβ)  plaques may be present in late-stage AD, and it was previously unknown if these would influence  quantification.    Researchers conducted a neuropathological assessment of cerebral (frontal, occipital, anterior and  posterior cingulate) cortex and cerebellar cortex tissue from the 87 end-of-life patients who underwent  a florbetaben PET scan before death. Presence of neuritic/cored and diffuse plaques was assessed as  absent, sparse, moderate and frequent. Mean cortical standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were  compared among brains with different cerebellar plaque loads. Results showed that the presence of  senile plaques in the cerebellum is very infrequent. The cerebellum most frequently shows sparse  diffuse plaques, which correspond to brains with higher cerebral cortical Aβ loads. However, the  presence of cerebellar senile plaques did not influence the SUVRs in subjects with presence of cerebral  cortical Aβ. Therefore, the data suggest that the effect of cerebellar senile plaques in 18F-florbetaben  SUVR is negligible, even in advanced stages of AD in patients with high cerebral cortical Aβ load.    “Florbetaben is a well-established and validated biomarker of neuritic ß-amyloid plaques,” said Andrew  Stephens, Chief Medical Officer of Piramal Imaging. “These analyses show us that by using florbetaben  in PET scans of the brain, we can examine the quantity and distribution of ß-amyloid plaques in specific  regions of the brain -- information that may better inform our understanding of the role of ß-amyloid  plaques in dementia onset and progression. Furthermore, these studies provide more detailed  information of florbetaben binding.”    About Neuraceq™ (florbetaben F18 injection)    INDICATION    Neuraceq™ is indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of the brain to estimate beta-  amyloid neuritic plaque density in adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for  Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other causes of cognitive decline.    A negative Neuraceq™ scan indicates sparse to no amyloid neuritic plaques and is inconsistent with a  neuropathological diagnosis of AD at the time of image acquisition; a negative scan result reduces the  likelihood that a patient's cognitive impairment is due to AD.

Neuraceq™ is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations. Neuraceq™ images should be interpreted  independent of a patient's clinical information. Physicians should receive training prior to interpretation  of Neuraceq™ images. Following training, image reading errors (especially false positive) may still occur.  Additional interpretation errors may occur due to, but not limited to, motion artifacts or extensive brain  atrophy.    Radiation Risk    Administration of Neuraceq™, similar to other radiopharmaceuticals, contributes to a patient´s overall  long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with  an increased risk of cancer. It is important to ensure safe handling to protect patients and health care  workers from unintentional radiation exposure.    Most Common Adverse Reactions    In clinical trials, the most frequently observed adverse drug reactions in 872 subjects with 978  Neuraceq™ administrations were injection/application site erythema (1.7%), injection site irritation  (1.2%), and injection site pain (3.9%).

07-May-2015,Piramal Fund Management commits INR 575cr to Ozone Urbana; makes largest residential investment in Bangalore,"Piramal Fund Management commits INR 575cr to Ozone Urbana; makes largest  residential investment in Bangalore    07 May 2015, Mumbai: Piramal Fund Management (“PFM”) has committed INR575cr to  Ozone Urbana, a large integrated township project spread across ~150 acres in Devanhalli,  North Bangalore.    Ozone Urbana has a total saleable area of ~7.8m sq ft configured as a combination of plots,  villaments, apartments and senior living – of which ~2.0m sq ft has already been sold. The  master plan approvals for the entire area as well as building plan approvals for ~3.5m sq ft are  in place and construction is currently underway with a targeted completion in 2021. Ozone has  an established track record in executing large scale projects and has already delivered over  5.0m sq ft.    The investment has been made in the form of a combination of structured debt and equity  upside secured against senior and exclusive charge by means of mortgage of the project along  with majority share pledge of the land holding companies and escrow of associated cash flows.  The intended use of proceeds includes a refinance of existing senior debt, payment of accrued  interest as well as working capital requirements.    Khushru Jijina, Managing Director, Piramal Fund Management said, “Ozone Urbana  enjoys distinct location advantages being right by the Bangalore International Airport in a  micro market that is witnessing strong sales volumes given the amenities, affordability and  improved infrastructure. In Ozone, we found a partner who was both uniquely capable and  strongly aligned as we focused on creating a customized financing structure that would allow  them to fast track the timely delivery and execution of the project.”    S. Vasudevan, Managing Director, Ozone Group said “We are extremely pleased to have  concluded this deal with Piramal. We believe they understand the real estate business  extremely well and have provided us with a complete solution which allows Ozone to fully  concentrate on its operations rather than any kind of financial engineering. This funding  completely de-risks the construction of Ozone Urbana and we are able to focus our energy on  quickening the pace of sales and execution as a result.”      About Piramal Enterprises Limited:  Piramal Enterprises Limited (PEL) is one of India’s large diversified companies, with a presence in  healthcare, healthcare information management and financial services.

Company has delivered a strong revenue performance with growth across business  segments during the year. 68% of our FY2015 revenues were generated in foreign currency.    Operating profit for Q4 FY2015 was 174% higher at Rs.194 Crores, primarily driven by strong  revenue performance across most of the businesses during the quarter and fall in R&D expenses.  R&D expenses were lower during the quarter on account of scaling back of our investments in NCE  research in Q2 FY2015. Operating profit for FY2015 was 39% higher at Rs.885 Crores. OPBITDA  margin went up from 14% in FY2014 to 17% in FY2015.    Net Profit for Q4 FY2015 was at Rs.95 Crores as against a net loss of Rs.311 Crores for Q4 FY2014.  The increase in net profit was mainly on account of improved performance across business  segments, lower interest cost due to reduction in long term debt and higher share of income from  associates, partly offset by marginal increase in depreciation. Net Profit for FY2015 was higher at  Rs.2,850 Crores as against a net loss of Rs.501 Crores for FY2014.    Interest expense for the quarter was lower primarily on account of reduction in debt using cash  proceeds from sale of our stake in Vodafone India.    Exceptional gain for FY2015 also includes gain on sale of 11% stake in Vodafone India for Rs.8,900  Cr (an Investment of Rs.5,864 Cr made in FY2012) partly offset by the amount written down on  account of scaling back of investments in NCE research in Q2 FY2015.

PFM has invested INR225cr with a subsidiary of Ganesh Housing Corporation Limited (GHCL), a  listed (BSE & NSE) and Tier I developer who is also a large land owner in Ahmedabad. The  investment is towards a prime city centric land parcel situated close to Surdhara Circle in  Thaltej, Ahmedabad. The project, extending over ~10 acres and 1.8m sq ft of saleable area, is  envisaged to be developed as a mixed use scheme with a combination of residential  apartments coupled with both commercial as well as a high street retail component. The deal  has been structured as a fixed return investment with appropriate security and control  mechanisms in place.    PFM is uniquely capable of catering to the entire capital stack – right from early stage equity to  late stage debt and construction finance and is therefore able to act as a perpetual provider of  capital for the real estate development life cycle. In addition to a sizeable portfolio extending  across the Tier 1 cities, PFM has been analyzing Tier II cities on a selective basis and intends  to scale up its exposure to these locations gradually.

22-Apr-2015,Piramal Imaging is Proud to Support Major New Research Study Assessing the Value of PET Scans in Alzheimer’s Disease and Dementia Diagnosis,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Media Contacts:  David Patti                                                             Nicole Fletcher  JFK Communications                                                      Piramal Imaging  dpatti@jfkhealth.com                                                    nicole.fletcher@piramal.com  (609) 456-0822                                                          (857) 202-1122     Piramal Imaging is Proud to Support Major New Research Study Assessing the        Value of PET Scans in Alzheimer’s Disease and Dementia Diagnosis    Alzheimer’s Association and American College of Radiology Lead IDEAS Trial to Inform Medicare                               Coverage of Brain Amyloid Imaging    BOSTON, April 22, 2015 – Piramal Imaging is proud to announce it will provide funding and support,  along with other industry partners, for a major clinical study titled, “Imaging Dementia – Evidence for  Amyloid Scanning” (IDEAS). The trial is designed to evaluate the impact of positron emission  tomography (PET) scanning of beta-amyloid deposits in the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in a  defined patient population. Piramal Imaging’s FDA-approved diagnostic radiotracer for brain beta-  amyloid detection, NeuraceqTM (florbetaben F18 injection), will be one of three radiotracers used in the  study.    “Our support of the IDEAS trial demonstrates our commitment to better understanding the role of beta-  amyloid imaging for patients with cognitive impairment or dementia,” said Andrew Stephens, M.D.,  Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer of Piramal Imaging. “We are motivated by the prospect that information  from studies such as this will help U.S. physicians, dealing with cognitive impairment on a day-to-day  basis, accurately and confidently differentiate Alzheimer’s disease from other etiologies.”    The IDEAS initiative, which is led by the Alzheimer’s Association and managed by the American College  of Radiology (ACR) and American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN), will enroll a total of  18,488 eligible Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older at roughly 200 sites throughout the United  States over the next two years. The study will assess the impact of brain beta-amyloid PET imaging on a  variety of patient outcome measures. The study protocol received approval with requirements by the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Participating providers will be reimbursed for the PET  scans under the CMS Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) policy that requires research study  participation as a condition of Medicare payment.    “We’re confident the IDEAS study will add to the growing body of clinical evidence and patient reported  outcomes to support a positive review by CMS for reimbursement of amyloid imaging – a critical  pathway to providing patients with appropriate access to beta-amyloid PET imaging with Neuraceq™,”  said Friedrich Gause, Chief Operating Officer of Piramal Imaging. “Piramal is honored to be part of this  major initiative and looks forward to the results of the study, which we believe will show the benefit of  imaging to patients and their families affected by this devastating disease.”    Alzheimer's disease is typically diagnosed after a person with a cognitive impairment undergoes an  extensive clinical examination, which typically includes family and medical history, physical neurological  and psychiatric examinations, laboratory tests, and imaging procedures such as computed tomography  (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However today many patients with dementia  symptoms can be misdiagnosed and a typical patient experiences symptoms for two years and visits an  average of two to three doctors before receiving a clinical diagnosis. A definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's  disease can only be made after death, based on autopsy findings of beta-amyloid plaques and  neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Today the combination of clinical diagnosis and a beta-amyloid  biomarker assessment improves the diagnostic accuracy while the patient is still alive.    About NeuraceqTM (florbetaben F18 injection)    Indication  This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only.    Neuraceq is a radiopharmaceutical indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of beta-  amyloid neuritic plaque density in the brains of adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being  evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other causes of cognitive impairment. Neuraceq should be  used in conjunction with a clinical evaluation. A negative scan indicates sparse or no neuritic plaques,  which is not consistent with a diagnosis of AD. For the limitations in the interpretation of a positive scan,  please refer to the US package insert.    Important Safety Information  Neuraceq cannot be used to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease and it cannot predict a patient’s  predisposition for beta-amyloid neuritic plaque development in the future. Neuraceq images should  only be interpreted by readers trained in the interpretation of PET images with florbetaben (18F  injection). Following training, image-reading errors (including false positive or false negative  interpretation of Neuraceq images) may still occur. Additional interpretation errors may occur due to  image noise, brain atrophy with a thinned cortical ribbon, or image blurs.    Administration of Neuraceq, as with other radiopharmaceuticals, results in a low amount of ionizing  radiation exposure. Safety precautions should be taken to ensure healthcare providers and patients do  not receive unintentional radiation exposure from Neuraceq.    Most Common Adverse Events  The most common side effects observed in clinical trials were injection site reaction and injection site  pain.    About Piramal Imaging  Piramal Imaging, a division of Piramal Enterprises, Ltd., was formed in 2012 with the acquisition of the  molecular imaging research and development portfolio of Bayer Pharma AG.

INR 400cr of this amount is  being used to part refinance existing senior lenders against pari passu senior charge on the cash  flows and development rights. The balance INR800cr is innovatively secured against a 20:80  scheme and is intended to be drawn as a line towards construction progress over the next two  years.    Omkar 1973 is the flagship property of Omkar with three high-rise towers spread over an area of 9  acres in the heart of the city off Annie Besant Road. The project, designed by Foster + Partners  has received all approvals with construction progressing in full swing. Of the three towers, two are  midway to completion and are expected to be delivered and handed over by the end of 2017.    The developer has received a tremendous response to a recently launched 20:80 scheme with  over 4 lakh sq ft being sold in just under three months in a market that has otherwise witnessed  slow velocity for high ticket unit purchases. The construction finance component of our transaction  will be utilized towards funding interim construction costs under this scheme and is further secured  by both the 80% receivables from the area sold as well as a substantial portion of additional area  retained as security on a senior and exclusive basis.    Khushru Jijina, Managing Director, Piramal Fund Management said, “Omkar remains a  preferred partner for our platform and with this transaction, we have demonstrated our ability to  remain a perpetual provider of capital across the entire capital stack.

24-Feb-2015,Piramal Fund Management expands offering to include construction finance; Approves transactions worth INR1100cr in the first instance,"Piramal Fund Management expands offering to include construction finance;          Approves transactions worth INR1100cr in the first instance      Tuesday, February 24, 2015, Mumbai: Piramal Fund Management had announced its  intention to enter the construction finance space in Q3 FY15. Today, it announces that has  approved 9 construction finance proposals totalling INR1100cr.    The initial transaction volume is spread across Mumbai, Delhi NCR, Bangalore, Pune and  Chennai, with projects located in micro markets with robust demand fundamentals. The funds  have been earmarked across a combination of late stage, mid-market residential developments  in both city centric as well as suburban locations. In one instance, funds are also intended for  construction of a brown-field commercial office development. These facilities range from 3-5  years each, with a sufficient principal moratorium period to allow the project cash-flows to  stabilize.    Piramal Fund Management is uniquely capable of catering to the entire capital stack – right  from early stage equity to late stage debt and now construction finance and is therefore able  to act as a perpetual provider of capital within this space. Typically, structured equity or  structured debt investments would often get refinanced by banks or other NBFCs once the  projects would achieve certain milestones - with construction finance, the platform is able to  extend the overall tenure of their relationship with a project by not requiring the development  partner to refinance once the project matures.    Khushru Jijina, Managing Director, Piramal Fund Management said, “With construction  finance, we have consciously completed the last remaining element in our our suite of product  offerings. This makes sense for our platform as well as for our development partners as we are  now able to further our engagement with them and fund the entire project life. We are looking  at many more such investments where the developers are experienced, projects are profitable  and de-risked, and our investment is ring fenced.”    About Piramal Enterprises Limited    Piramal Enterprises Limited (PEL) is one of India’s large diversified companies, with a presence  in healthcare, healthcare information management and financial services.

Company delivered a strong revenue performance with growth  across all segments in both the quarter and nine-month periods. 69% of our 9M FY2015 revenues  were generated in foreign currency.    Operating Profit    Operating profit for Q3 FY2015 was 16% higher at ` 320 Crores primarily driven by strong revenue  performance across businesses during the quarter and fall in R&D expenses. R&D expenses were  lower during the quarter on account of scaling back of investments in NCE research in Q2 FY2015.    Operating profit for 9M FY2015 was 22% higher at ` 693 Crores.    Net Profit    Net Profit for Q3 FY2015 was higher at ` 249 Crores as against a net loss of ` 11 Crores for Q3  FY2014. The increase in net profit was mainly on account of improved operating performance, lower  interest cost due to reduction in long term debt, exceptional gain and higher share of income from  associates, partly offset by marginal increase in depreciation and higher tax expense.    Net Profit for 9M FY2015 was at ` 2,755 Crores as against a net loss of ` 190 Crores for 9M FY2014.                                                                                                                           Page 2 of 5          Interest Expenses            Interest expense for the quarter was lower primarily on account of reduction in debt using cash          proceeds from sale of our stake in Vodafone India.            Exceptional Gain/ Loss            Exceptional Gain during Q3 FY2015 was on account of partial reversal of the amount written down in          Q2 on account of scaling back of investments in NCE Research.            Exceptional gain for 9M FY2015 also includes gain on sale of 11% stake in Vodafone India for `          8,900 Cr (an Investment of ` 5,864 Cr made in FY2012) partly offset by the amount written down on          account of scaling back of investments in NCE research in Q2 FY2015.            Share of Associates            Income under share of associates for the quarter primarily includes our share in the profits of Shriram          Capital for this period.

The CMO Leadership Awards by Life Science Leader magazine is based on industry leading research  conducted by Nice Insight. Nice insights surveys over 11,000 industry executives - buyers of  outsourced services annually, to determine perception and awareness scores of CMOs for five  different attributes (i.e. Innovation, Productivity, Quality, Regulatory, and Reliability). The four  categories in which the Pharma Solution division has won are:          Reliability for Big Pharma        Reliability for Mid-Size & Specialty Pharma        Regulatory for Mid-Size & Specialty Pharma        Quality for Emerging Pharma    Companies achieving top 20 percentile perception scores across these 5 attributes are recognized for  their achievement.

It will be accessible in  8 languages - Hindi, English, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Marathi, Assamese & Bengali.    With the help of Piramal Swasthya‟s „Hub and Spoke‟ model where the hub will be located in  Hyderabad that will detect incoming calls, and basis which the call will be forwarded to a  regional level call centers (spokes) depending on the language chosen by the caller. All call  centers will be staffed by trained and experienced counselors. The counsellors will be from  Nursing, Paramedics, Sociology, Psychology, Social Work, etc. background and have  undergone counseling skills training at Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) in  collaboration with NACO. Through this model government aims to achieve its goals for the  fourth phase of NACP which is reducing new infections by 50% and providing  comprehensive care, support and treatment to all persons living with HIV/AIDS.    With the scale up of targeted interventions, Information Education and Communication  (IEC) campaigns as well as care, support and treatment services in the country under NACP  IV, it is expected that the national helpline will be a key milestone towards universalizing  access to information and counselling on HIV and AIDS. It is hoped that the helpline  enhances the uptake of HIV counselling and testing as well as other services nationwide  contributing towards achieving the NACP IV goals.

01-Dec-2014,"Piramal Imaging Taps M2i to Manufacture and Distribute NeuraCeq , in Ireland","Press Release  Piramal Imaging Taps M2i to Manufacture and Distribute  NeuraCeq™ in Ireland  NeuraCeq to be first locally manufactured beta-amyloid tracer in Irish market    01 December 2014 ‒ Piramal Imaging today announced it has entered into a definitive  agreement with M2i for the exclusive manufacturing and distribution of NeuraCeq in Ireland.  With this agreement M2i through their Dublin PET manufacturing site, aims to bring  NeuraCeq to market as the first locally manufactured beta-amyloid tracer in the Republic of  Ireland and Northern Ireland.    Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementia rates in Ireland are predicted to grow rapidly  from 38,000 people affected now to 50,000 in 2016 and 100,000 by 20361. NeuraCeq,  which received marketing authorization in the European Union and in the United States  earlier this year, is indicated for imaging the density of beta-amyloid neuritic plaque in the  brain as part of an evaluation for adult patients with cognitive impairment. A negative beta-  amyloid scan may help rule out AD as a cause of a patient’s cognitive decline.    “Beta-amyloid imaging is a valuable new tool for assessing patients dealing with cognitive  impairment symptoms,” said Ruairi O’Donnell, Managing Director, M2i. “The number of  patients with dementia in Ireland mirrors that of many countries where populations are  aging. Working with Piramal Imaging to bring NeuraCeq to experienced clinicians who  diagnose and manage patients suspected of AD and dementia lets M2i play a key role in  addressing this nationwide health concern and improving outcomes.”    “To help advance the accuracy of clinical diagnosis, Piramal Imaging is working quickly to  build out its manufacturing and distribution network,” said Friedrich Gause, Chief Operating  Officer, Piramal Imaging. “Our goal is to work with partners who share our ambition to  accelerate and maximize access to beta-amyloid imaging and NeuraCeq for imagers,  referring physicians and their patients. M2i offers the local knowledge, services and reach  we need to get NeuraCeq to a new and ready market effectively.”    About NeuraCeq  Indication  This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only.    NeuraCeq is a radiopharmaceutical indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET)  imaging of beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density in the brains of adult patients with cognitive  impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other causes of  cognitive impairment. NeuraCeq should be used in conjunction with a clinical evaluation.  A negative scan indicates sparse or no plaques, which is not consistent with a diagnosis of  AD. For the limitations in the interpretation of a positive scan, please refer to the SmPC.    Important Safety Information      1      http://www.irishhealth.com/article.html?id=13433                                                           1/3                                                                                US/FBB/0314/0012  NeuraCeq is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new  safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse  reactions.    NeuraCeq can be used for the imaging of beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density in the brain.  NeuraCeq cannot be used to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease and it cannot predict a patient’s  predisposition for beta-amyloid plaque development in the future. NeuraCeq images should  only be interpreted by readers trained in the interpretation of PET images with florbetaben  (18F). Following training, image reading errors (including false positive or false negative  interpretation of NeuraCeq images) may still occur. Additional interpretation errors may  occur due to image noise, atrophy with a thinned cortical ribbon, or image blurs.    Administration of NeuraCeq, as with other radiopharmaceuticals, results in a low amount of  ionizing radiation exposure. Safety precautions should be taken to ensure healthcare  providers and patients do not receive unintentional radiation exposure from NeuraCeq.    Most Common Adverse Events  The most common side effects observed in clinical trials were injection site reaction and  injection site pain.    About M2i  M2i, an independent privately owned Irish company, produces radiopharmaceuticals for use  in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. Its manufacturing facility located in Dublin  is fully licenced by the HPRA (Health Products Regulatory Authority) and has been supplying  PET products to imaging centres across all geographical regions of Ireland since 2001.

05-Nov-2014,Piramal Fund Management’s ‘Indiareit Apartment Fund’ oversubscribed within three months of launch; secures an aggregate INR500cr of commitments; commits INR125cr across three transactions,"Piramal Fund      Management’s ‘Indiareit Apartment Fund’  oversubscribed within three months of launch; secures an  aggregate INR500cr of commitments; commits INR125cr across  three transactions    Wednesday, November 5th, 2014, Mumbai: Piramal Fund Management has surpassed its  initial fund size of INR350cr for the „Indiareit Apartment Fund‟ by raising INR500cr of  aggregate commitments in just under three months since launch. The platform has exercised  its green shoe option to increase the size of the offering towards a hard cap of INR700cr. IIFL  Wealth Management Ltd. acted as the exclusive distributor for the entire fund raise.    The Fund is uniquely positioned as a first-to-market platform for underwriting units only i.e.  physical square feet rather than financial participation, whilst adhering to the basic tenets of a  defined use of funds, appropriate security and monitoring as well as ensuring developer  alignment and project completion – key risks that a retail buyer in the open market would  want to address. For the investor, the Fund therefore enables them to access value deals in  the market and participate in a „secured‟ position with the benefit of a highly attractive price  point, diligence and structuring vis a vis an individual transaction.    The Fund has already disbursed its first transaction, a INR50cr investment into Omkar Alta  Monte in Mumbai (Malad) wherein the Fund has underwritten specific units at a substantial  discount to prevailing market prices. The Fund has also approved two further transactions, in  Mumbai (Bandra Kurla Complex) and Chennai (Adyar) respectively, which are in final stages of  pre disbursement diligence.    Khushru Jijina, Managing Director, Piramal Fund Management said, “We are once again  humbled to see such an overwhelming response to the fund raising exercise carried out by our  platform. With the Apartment Fund, we have consciously added another product to our suite of  offerings to further our engagement with our development partners. This strategy uniquely  enables them to advance construction and delivery of units without the pressure of sales and  increases visibility of site progress.”    About Piramal Enterprises Limited:  Piramal Enterprises Limited (PEL) is one of India‟s largest diversified companies, with a presence in  pharmaceuticals, healthcare information management and financial services.

27-Oct-2014,Piramal Enterprises ropes in Sharman Joshi as brand ambassador for their latest OTC product offering -‘QuikKool’,"Press Release        Piramal Enterprises ropes in Sharman Joshi as brand ambassador for                their latest OTC product offering -‘QuikKool’    Mumbai, October 27, 2014: Piramal‟s Consumer Product Division takes on the problem of  painful mouth ulcers with their new Quikkool mouth ulcer gel. To promote the product the  division has signed on the multi-faceted and well known Indian actor, Sharman Joshi. His work  both on the silver screen and theatre has been well appreciated, earning him many fans and  awards.    The mouth is one of the most sensitive areas of the body and ulcers can be extremely painful  which may impair the quality of life. Severe ulcers could also result in facing socially awkward  and challenging situations such as difficulty in eating, drinking or talking,” said Mr. Kedar  Rajadnye, President & COO - Consumer Products Division, Piramal Enterprises. Adding  further he also said, “Through the launch of QuikKool, Piramal aims to improve the oral health  and well-being of consumers by way of gifting a smile to every sufferer.”    The QuikKool campaign also ropes in another very well respected ad guru, Prasoon Joshi,  Chairman Asia Pacific &CEO of McCann Worldgroup India. Prasoon Joshi has gained fame  over the years for his ground-breaking work in the advertisement world, award winning lyrics  and film scripts.    Ad Guru Prasoon Joshi came up with the campaign title as “Chaale ko Dekhlunga” (which  roughly means „Ulcers – I will tackle you head-on!‟). Prasoon Joshi drew from the insight that  when we feel irritated, we wish to get back at the source of agony and comments that “the  communication for QuikKool Mouth Ulcer Gel intends to resonate the „irritated yet helpless‟  feeling that comes when you suffer with mouth ulcers. We have tried to colloquially express this  feeling and hope the language of the brand will become part of the common parlance.”    This particular advertisement was shot in Mumbai, against the setting of snow-capped  mountains where Sharman plays the role of a Sherpa who rescues a man with mouth ulcer pain.    While expressing his happiness to be chosen as the brand ambassador for QuikKool, Sharman  Joshi said, “I loved the concept of the ad which is a „Sherpa‟. It‟s very whacky and different.”  He further added, “I can imagine ulcers been very painful and it can throw you off your daily  schedule but now I know the solution for mouth ulcers – QuikKool.”    Quikkool is a unique mouth ulcer gel that provides instant relief from pain & burning sensation  of mouth ulcers. It contains lignocaine which numbs the ulcer to provide instant pain relief and  Choline Salicylate that soothes the burning sensation. The gel based formula enables quick  healing.    Piramal Enterprises is one the leading players in the self-care domain, wherein, consumers take  their own self care decisions to solve their health related problems that disrupts their routine.  Mouth Ulcers‟ is one of those routine stopping‟ problems faced by consumers that need to be  solved. Piramal Enterprises met lot of consumers to understand the intense pain they felt while  eating and talking - caused due to Ulcers. They found out that there is currently no single  effective solution for mouth Ulcers, so they developed QuikKool a Pain Relieving Mouth Ulcer Gel  that gives instant relief from pain as well as provides a cooling and comforting effect, thus  enables the consumer to get on with one‟s life.                                            ***  About Consumer Products:  The Consumer Product division is one of the fastest growing players in the Domestic Consumer  Healthcare Market.

He added, ""Be  fortresses around those who are doing well for the society and never be discouraged by the  times, as setbacks in life are inevitable.” He advised the audience, that they should not  become their jobs, as jobs are ephemeral. He told them to never compromise and that their  life’s goal should be an autonomous goal to their job.    During the course of the event, an interactive session was organized by Piramal Foundation  with Swami Swatmananda of the Chinmaya Mission, where he addressed the attendees. Lt.  General Arun Kumar Sahni, GOC-in-C, South Western Command, shared his insights on  leadership the military way.

16-Sep-2014,Piramal supports J&K’s disaster relief operations,"News release                            Piramal supports J&K’s disaster relief operations    16 September, 2014 Mumbai/Delhi: Piramal Foundation has partnered with the Central  Government, Jammu & Kashmir state governments and Indian Air Force to provide relief support to  the flood ravaged state.    One of the direst needs of the State is at present clean and safe drinking water, as the main source  of water has been contaminated. To address this issue, Piramal Sarvajal, Piramal Foundation’s  philanthropic safe drinking water initiative, is in the process of sending and setting up 10 Sarvajal  water purification plants across Srinagar. Four plants have been sent via the Indian Air Force, of  which one has been installed at the Srinigar Air Force station. Another six Sarvajal plants shall be  sent over the course of the week. More plants are being organized and shall be provided as per the  needs of the State. The Piramal Sarvajal team of engineers and technicians has been stationed in the  State to install, run and maintain the machines.    The joint relief exercise is being helped and coordinated via the Prime Minister’s Office, Cabinet  Secretariat, Home Secretary, Air Force, the J&K Government through its Resident Commissioner,  ISKCON and Akal Takht (Golden Temple) for volunteer force and manpower.    Apart from this, Piramal has offered to help set up an automated kitchen, as and when required,  with ISKCON and led by Dr.Radhakrishna Das. Akal Takht has offered its volunteer network to  provide disaster relief.    The next big threat seen is a health epidemic; hence Piramal has also offered to help with healthcare  solutions through Piramal Swasthya, which runs 104 a healthcare helpline across 6 states, mobile  health units and telemedicine centres.    The entire exercise draws from Piramal’s experience in disaster relief in Uttrakhand, where a team  has been set up to help bring back normalcy and train women in vocational jobs.

27-Aug-2014,Piramal Sarvajal successfully completes a year in Jaipur through their ‘Jaipur Schools Program’," Piramal Sarvajal successfully completes a year in Jaipur through                    their ‘Jaipur Schools Program’    The program aims at providing free safe drinking water to 1200 students in Jaipur    August 27, 2014: Piramal Sarvajal, an initiative under Piramal Foundation today  completed a year of service since the launch of its first Water ATM in Jaipur – through  their „Jaipur Schools Program‟. The program which is a three year phase, has  successfully completed its first phase. To celebrate the occasion Mr Jitendra Kumar Soni,  IAS, CEO Zilla Parishad, Mr Harish Manwani, GM- Rural Operations, Mr Dharamveer  Singh, Sarvajal were present at Rajkiya Prathmik Vidhyalay Santoshpura, Chaksu block,  District Jaipur where the event took place.    The plan for the „Jaipur Schools Program‟ was conceptualized in the year 2011 by  Piramal Sarvajal, as they realized there was a need for safe drinking water there. They  observed that the ground water had dangerously high levels of ionic contamination,  making the water not suitable to drink. Piramal Sarvajal partnered with the Michael and  Susan Dell Foundation (MSDF) and the Akshaya Patra Foundation to start „Jaipur Schools  Program‟ – a three year project under MSDF‟s (Michael & Susan Dell  Foundation) „Community and School Based Health Improvement Program‟.    The aim of this project is to create provisions for safe drinking water at schools  especially in the regions with excessive ionic contamination in groundwater. 15  government schools in Sanganer (Jaipur District), consisting of around 1500 primary  school students, were short listed for the project. 6 out of the 15 schools listed, lack  reliable access to power supply. With the inauguration at a Govt primary school in  Santoshpura, Block Chaksu, Jaipur district a year ago in August 2013, Piramal Sarvajal  had officially begun working on the first phase of the program aimed at providing free of  cost filtered drinking water in school    Commenting on the success of phase one, of the „Jaipur Schools Program‟, Mr. Anuj  Sharma, COO, Piramal Sarvajal said, “We started this program a year ago with the  aim of providing pure and clean drinking water to school children – which is their right  and an essential element of their health. A year later we are happy to have completed  phase one of the project and are looking forward to the success of the program where a  total of 1600 students and teachers will be benefited.”    The Piramal Sarvajal Water ATM is essentially a modular RFID controlled standalone  water dispensing unit. It is very simple to use, and like any usual ATM the customer  swipes a prepaid card on the screen and chooses the amount of water he/she wishes to  dispense. The water is filtered through 5 stages and the quality is in accordance with the  international drinking water standard.    About Piramal Foundation:    Piramal Foundation strongly believes that there are several untapped innovative  solutions that can address India‟s most pressing problems. Piramal Foundation plays an  impactful role in implementing and facilitating such projects.

12-Aug-2014,"First US Commercial Neuraceq , Scan for Beta-Amyloid Plaque Imaging Performed at WVU Healthcare","Press Release  First US Commercial Neuraceq™ Scan for Beta-Amyloid Plaque  Imaging Performed at WVU Healthcare  Boston/West Virginia, August 12, 2014 Piramal Imaging today announced that WVU  Healthcare in West Virginia, is the first center in the United States to perform commercial  scans using Neuraceq. Neuraceq became available for commercial use on August 1, marking  the first time patients are able to receive Neuraceq scans in the United States outside of  research studies.    Neuraceq, which received marketing authorization in the European Union and in the United  States earlier this year, is a radiopharmaceutical indicated for Positron Emission  Tomography (PET) imaging of the brain to estimate beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density in  adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease  (AD) and other causes of cognitive decline. A negative beta-amyloid scan may help rule out  AD as a cause of a patient’s cognitive decline. A positive Neuraceq scan indicates moderate  to frequent amyloid neuritic plaques; neuropathological examination has shown this amount  of amyloid neuritic plaque is present in patients with AD, but may also be present in  patients with other types of neurologic conditions as well as older people with normal  cognition. Prior to the availability of this technology a confirmation of the clinical diagnosis  of AD could only be accomplished through autopsy.    Neuraceq was approved by the FDA earlier this year. Neuraceq scans will be available  commercially for referring physicians and patients across the U.S. in the coming weeks and  months.    ”At WVU Healthcare, we are making history as the first center in the U.S. to offer patients  access to beta-amyloid imaging with florbetaben without enrolling in a research trial.” said  Dr. Gary D. Marano, Medical Director of Nuclear Medicine and PET/CT. “For us as clinicians,  it’s a new diagnostic option to offer patients and referring physicians in cases of cognitive  decline and concerns for Alzheimer’s disease.”    “As a company dedicated to innovation in molecular imaging, it was important to deliver  Neuraceq into hands of trained dementia experts as soon as possible to start advancing  treatment options and improving patient outcomes.” said Friedrich Gause, Chief Operating  Officer, Piramal Imaging “We view this as an important milestone but just the beginning of  our work to bring beta-amyloid imaging to the U.S. patient population.”    About Neuraceq  Neuraceq is indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of the brain to  estimate beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density in adult patients with cognitive impairment  who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other causes of cognitive decline.    A negative Neuraceq scan indicates sparse to no amyloid neuritic plaques and is inconsistent  with a neuropathological diagnosis of AD at the time of image acquisition; a negative scan  result reduces the likelihood that a patient’s cognitive impairment is due to AD. A positive  Neuraceq scan indicates moderate to frequent amyloid neuritic plaques; neuropathological  examination has shown this amount of amyloid neuritic plaque is present in patients with                                               1/3                                                                                  US/FBB/0314/0012  AD, but may also be present in patients with other types of neurologic conditions as well as  older people with normal cognition.    Neuraceq is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations.    Limitations of Use     A positive Neuraceq scan does not establish the diagnosis of AD or any other cognitive     disorder.     Safety and effectiveness of Neuraceq have not been established for:         o Predicting development of dementia or other neurologic conditions;         o Monitoring responses to therapies.    IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION  Risk for Image Interpretation and Other Errors  Neuraceq can be used to estimate the density of beta-amyloid neuritic plaque deposition in  the brain. Neuraceq is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations. Neuraceq images should  be interpreted independent of a patient's clinical information. Physicians should receive  training prior to interpretation of Neuraceq images. Following training, image reading errors  (especially false positives) may still occur. Additional interpretation errors may occur due to,  but not limited to, motion artifacts or extensive brain atrophy.    Radiation Risk  Administration of Neuraceq, similar to other radiopharmaceuticals, contributes to a  patient´s overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation  exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer. It is important to ensure safe  handling to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure.      Most Common Adverse Reactions  In clinical trials, the most frequently observed adverse drug reactions in 872 subjects with  978 Neuraceq administrations were injection/application site erythema (1.7%), injection site  irritation (1.2%), and injection site pain (3.9%).    About Piramal Imaging  Piramal Imaging, a division of Piramal Enterprises, Ltd., was formed in 2012 with the  acquisition of the molecular imaging research and development portfolio of Bayer Pharma  AG. By developing novel PET tracers for molecular imaging, Piramal Imaging is focusing on  a key field of modern medicine.

04-Aug-2014,"First Site in Europe Begins to Offer Commercial Scans Using Piramal Imaging’s NeuraCeq , for Beta-Amyloid Plaque Imaging","Press Release  First Site in Europe Begins to Offer Commercial Scans Using  Piramal Imaging’s NeuraCeq™ for Beta-Amyloid Plaque Imaging    Milestone for Dementia Diagnosis and Molecular Imaging    Cambridge, UK/Cologne, Germany, August 4, 2014 ‒ Piramal Imaging announced  today that the Clinic of Nuclear Medicine at the University of Cologne, Germany, is the first  center in the world to perform Neuraceq™ PET imaging scans on patients outside of clinical  research studies. Availability of NeuraCeq™ began on July 22, marking the first time  patients were able to receive a NeuraCeq scan at the request of a referring physician.    NeuraCeq, which received marketing authorization in the European Union and in the United  States earlier this year, is a radiopharmaceutical indicated for Positron Emission  Tomography (PET) imaging of the brain to estimate beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density in  adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease  (AD) and other causes of cognitive decline. A negative beta-amyloid scan may help rule out  AD as a cause of a patient’s cognitive decline. A positive Neuraceq scan indicates moderate  to frequent amyloid neuritic plaques; neuropathological examination has shown this amount  of amyloid neuritic plaque is present in patients with AD, but may also be present in  patients with other types of neurologic conditions as well as older people with normal  cognition. Prior to the availability of this technology a confirmation of the clinical diagnosis  of AD could only be accomplished through autopsy.    NeuraCeq is authorized by the European Commission. NeuraCeq scans will be available at  selected PET imaging centers in Germany with plans for expanding patient access across  Germany throughout the year.    “It is great to have a beta-amyloid tracer available for use with our patients,” said Prof. Dr.  Alexander Drzezga, Director of the Clinic for Nuclear Medicine at the University of Cologne,  Germany. “For us as clinicians, beta-amyloid imaging with a targeted tracer such as  NeuraCeq is a valuable new instrument for improving dementia diagnosis and patient  assessment. This new imaging tool may also help patients and their families to gain more  certainty and to plan for their future.”    “With the launch of NeuraCeq in Germany, we’ve begun to widen the access to beta-amyloid  imaging, taking a major step in defining and refining the role of such testing to support the  selection of appropriate treatment options and improving outcomes for patients with  cognitive impairment,” said Friedrich Gause, Chief Operating Officer Piramal Imaging  “We’re moving quickly to get NeuraCeq into the hands of experienced clinicians who  diagnose and manage patients suspected of AD and dementia, underscoring Piramal  Imaging’s commitment to advancing the state of the art in dementia diagnosis and  molecular imaging.”    About NeuraCeq    Indication  This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only.                                               1/3                                                                                  US/FBB/0314/0012  NeuraCeq is a radiopharmaceutical indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET)  imaging of beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density in the brains of adult patients with cognitive  impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other causes of  cognitive impairment. NeuraCeq should be used in conjunction with a clinical evaluation.  A negative scan indicates sparse or no plaques, which is not consistent with a diagnosis of  AD. For the limitations in the interpretation of a positive scan, please refer to the SmPC.    Important Safety Information  NeuraCeq can be used for the imaging of beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density in the brain.  NeuraCeq cannot be used to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease and it cannot predict a patient’s  predisposition for beta-amyloid plaque development in the future. NeuraCeq images should  only be interpreted by readers trained in the interpretation of PET images with florbetaben  (18F). Following training, image reading errors (including false positive or false negative  interpretation of NeuraCeq images) may still occur. Additional interpretation errors may  occur due to image noise, atrophy with a thinned cortical ribbon, or image blurs.    Administration of NeuraCeq, as with other radiopharmaceuticals, results in a low amount of  ionizing radiation exposure. Safety precautions should be taken to ensure healthcare  providers and patients do not receive unintentional radiation exposure from NeuraCeq.    Most Common Adverse Events  The most common side effects observed in clinical trials were injection site reaction and  injection site pain.

30-Jul-2014,APG and Piramal Enterprises Limited Announce Strategic Investment Alliance,"APG and Piramal Enterprises Limited Announce Strategic  Investment Alliance  Targeted Investment of US$ 1 billion in Infrastructure Companies in India    • One of the largest institutional platforms focused on mezzanine investments in the    infrastructure sector in India  • One of the largest private sector commitments to the infrastructure sector in India  • The single largest commitment of APG to the infrastructure sector in India to date    July 30, 2014, Mumbai: Piramal Enterprises Limited (PEL), one of India’s largest  diversified companies, and APG Asset Management, the Dutch pension fund asset  manager, today announced a strategic alliance for investing in rupee denominated  mezzanine instruments issued by infrastructure companies in India with a target  investment of US$ 1 billion over the next 3 years. PEL and APG have each initially  committed US$375 million for investments under this strategic alliance.    This is one of the largest private sector commitments to the infrastructure sector in India  and one of the single largest commitments to date by a foreign investor to the  infrastructure sector in India.    Ajay Piramal, Chairman of PEL said, “We are extremely pleased to be partnering with  an institution like APG who is a like-minded, focused and committed global investor. This  is an opportune time to be creating an aligned pool of capital to target what we believe  to be very compelling funding opportunities in the infrastructure sector in India. The  alliance is consistent with PEL’s long-term plan and vision of playing a contributing role  towards investments that promote growth. This is the single largest investment of APG  in the unlisted space in India till date and underlines the confidence reposed by  institutional investors in Piramal Group’s capabilities.”    Dick Sluimers, CEO of APG said, “APG puts a great deal of effort and time into  selecting the right partners and forming long-term relationships. In PEL, we found an  aligned partner with the requisite expertise and industry knowledge to add value through  active ownership, which is why we have teamed up with PEL for this strategic alliance in  India. The strategy of the alliance to focus on mezzanine investments in infrastructure  projects in India ticks the right boxes for our pension fund clients in terms of risk-return  profile and high cash flow visibility.”    This strategic pool of capital will focus on operational and near completion projects with  limited execution risks and high visibility of cash flows coming from a portfolio of  projects. The access to this source of capital will enable infrastructure players in India to  retain their equity interest in the assets, while raising long term capital to help them  complete their on-going infrastructure projects and enhance shareholder value.    Jayesh Desai, co-Head of Structured Investment Group (SIG), PEL said “Indian  infrastructure players have moved up in maturity scale as the portfolio of operational  projects has increased and hence, is lending high visibility to future cash flows. Over  USD 150 billion of equity and mezzanine funding is required to meet government target  investment of USD 1 trillion until 2017, and this is the gap which our strategic alliance  seeks to bridge. Mezzanine investments for infrastructure sector in India offers a  compelling investment proposition as it addresses the void in the capital stack, which  currently exists in the market place. This is due to the constraints of commercial banks  in India to provide only senior secured lending at asset level where there is limited  headroom, especially in cases where there has been delay in project execution”.      Hans-Martin Aerts, Head of Infrastructure Asia, APG said, “We are very pleased to  partner with PEL in this venture. The current market circumstances where there is a  mismatch between demand and supply of capital creates a window of opportunity to  make mezzanine investments in Indian infrastructure. We believe that the infrastructure  sector in India is at an inflection point. Given the strong push of the new government on  sector revival through conducive policy measures, the funding from this strategic alliance  will help infrastructure companies to recycle capital and contribute significantly to the  further development of India’s infrastructure sector.”      PEL has demonstrated strong sourcing and risk underwriting capabilities, and has  developed a strong track record in providing mezzanine funding to corporates in various  sectors including infrastructure.    Macquarie Capital acted as the sole financial advisor for the transaction.

28-Jul-2014,Piramal Sarvajal partners with Department of Irrigation and Public Health (DI&PH) to launch the first water ATM in Shimla,"    Piramal Sarvajal partners with Department of Irrigation and Public Health                  (DI&PH) to launch the first water ATM in Shimla           Piramal Sarvajal aims at providing 24x7 service through a one of its kind eco-friendly purified         drinking water solution at an affordable cost      Shimla, July 28, 2014: Piramal Sarvajal, an initiative under Piramal Foundation, today inaugurated their  first water ATM unit in Shimla. The honours were done by the Hon’ble Chief Minister, Mr. Virbhadra  Singh at a gala event at The Ridge, Shimla. The ceremony also witnessed the presence of Smt. Vidya  Stokes – I&PH Minister, Mr. Vineet Chaudhary - Additional Chief Secretary - DI&PH, Mr.  Amarjeet Singh - Commissioner - MC Shimla and other senior officials.    Being the hub of India’s tourism sector and amongst the top 10 preferred entrepreneurial locations,  Shimla witness’s an influx of local and international tourist visits round the year. Majority of tourists rely  on expensive packaged drinking water which is then disposed along the roadside; adding to non-  biodegradable waste which is hazardous to the ecosystem. The civic authorities in Shimla are thus striving  hard to preserve the natural beauty while dealing with litter issues caused by the empty plastic water  bottles left by tourist.    With this thought in mind, Piramal Sarvajal decided to partner with the Department of Irrigation and  Public Health (DI&PH) to install a water ATM in Shimla. Basis this partnership, the Department of  Irrigation and Public Health (DI&PH) will be responsible for providing water access at the site while the  Municipal Corporation - Shimla and Himachal Pradesh Bus Stand Management & Development Authority  shall provide access to space for the unit installation. Piramal Sarvajal will ensure proper installation;  operations and maintenance of the integrated water ATM unit while also conduct IEC activities in-house for  promoting safe water practices and creating awareness about water-health risks.    Mr. Paresh Parasnis, CEO-Piramal Foundation, said, “Being a tourist destination, large quantities of  empty packaged water bottles on the streets of Shimla are a common sight. The reason being that there  is a huge need for affordable and safe drinking water provisions at strategic tourist spots and public places  in Shimla, while not littering the streets. Through this partnership with the Department of Irrigation and  Public Health (DI&PH), we are extremely delighted to install the first water ATM in Shimla which will be a  big step in maintaining a clean environment. Going one step ahead, we will also be providing consumers  with an empty bottle which can be reused at our ATMs. This system will help the civic authorities in Shimla  to deal with one less plastic bottle littered on the road.”    Mr. Anuj Sharma, COO-Piramal Sarvajal, said, “As tourism is the mainstay of the state's economy, this  strategic alliance gives us a platform to promote safe drinking water for all visitors through a reliable and  technologically advanced mechanism. Apart from providing an alternative to purchasing drinking water  bottle, the project shall also assist the civic authorities to keep the tourist spots clean. Besides every time  this facility dispenses water, the user saves Rs. 9/- and Shimla Municipal Corporation will have one bottle  less i.e. plastic litter to clean up. Therefore we are happy to partner with the Department of Irrigation and  Public Health (DI&PH) as we aim to focus our energies towards serving a broad range of consumers with  the basic requirement of purified drinking water solution at an affordable cost”.    Piramal Sarvajal has signed similar tripartite MoUs with various relevant stakeholders such as  Dharamshala, Chintpurni (Una) and Mandi, for multiple installations across the state of Himachal Pradesh  on BOMM (Build-Operate-Maintain-Manage) basis.    Piramal Sarvajal integrated its proprietary technologies which comprises of a remote sensing enabled  purification plant and two automated water dispensing units (Water ATM). This helped in developing a  standalone, fully automated purification and dispensing unit for creating in-situ provision for affordable  safe drinking water at such locations. The water ATM is a modular RFID controlled standalone water  dispensing unit which is specifically designed to track and capture every transaction that takes place on a  real time basis to avoid wastage of water. It is extremely simple to use, and like any usual ATM the  customer swipes a prepaid card on the screen and chooses the amount of water he/she wishes to  dispense. The water gets filtered through 5-stages and the quality is in accordance with the international  drinking water quality standard i.e. ISI 10500.    Piramal Sarvajal has been dedicatedly delivering affordable and healthier solutions to the drinking water  crisis in the villages and small towns of Rajasthan, Haryana and Gujarat since 2008. The project Piramal  Sarvajal that started in 2008 runs community-level water solutions including water ATMs that are today  providing affordable clean drinking water to more than 141,000 people on a daily basis. Piramal Sarvajal  presently operates in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. In New Delhi, Piramal  Sarvajal has its plants at AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Science) for their out-patient department; a  clear testament of the quality of water provided. Piramal Sarvajal is working in partnership with Delhi Jal  Board to provide water to slums and settlement with no-piped water supply, this urban initiative will soon  be reaching out to approximately 50,000 users.          About Piramal Foundation:  Piramal Foundation strongly believes that there are several untapped innovative solutions that can  address India’s most pressing problems. Piramal Foundation plays an impactful role in implementing and  facilitating such projects. Each social project that is chosen to be funded and nurtured by the Piramal  Foundation fits into one of the four broad areas – healthcare, education, livelihood creation and youth  empowerment.

15-Jul-2014,Dr Shashikant Mishra inaugurates Piramal Sarvajal’s water purification set-up in Rakhigarhi," Dr Shashikant Mishra inaugurates Piramal Sarvajal’s water purification set-up in                                    Rakhigarhi    Piramal’s initiative to promote pure drinking water to villagers thereby creating a positive impact on their health          Hisar - Haryana, 15 July 2014: Piramal Sarvajal, an initiative under Piramal Foundation recently  announced the installation of a COCO Piramal Sarvajal plant in Rakhigarhi - a village in the Hisar  district of the state of Haryana around 150 kilometres from Delhi.    In May 2012, the Global Heritage Fund, declared Rakhigarhi as one of the 10 most endangered  heritage sites in Asia. Archaeologists in 1963, discovered that the village was the site of the largest  known city of the historic Indus Valley civilization, a city that was much larger and more ancient  than Harappa and Mohenjodaro sites. Since 1997, the Archaeological Survey of India has  undertaken a detailed excavation of the site, recovering numerous artefacts, some over 5,000 years  old.    Piramal Sarvajal extended its support to Rakhigarhi as the quality of water in Rakhigarhi is  extremely poor, with TDS levels between 3,500 to 10,000. This meant that the village didn’t have  access to clean and pure drinking water, thereby impacting villager’s everyday life. Piramal Sarvajal  has decided to install a plant with capacity of 500 litres per hour. These purification machines will  provide clean affordable drinking water to 500 families (2500 people), on a daily basis across the  village.    The Piramal Sarvajal plant was inaugurated by Dr. Shashikant Mishra, Retd. IAS, the Former  Principal Secretary to Prime Minister of India, Padma Bhushan Awardee and former  Chairman of INTACH. The event was also attended by other senior representatives of Piramal  Sarvajal such as C.E.O Vasu Padmnabhan, C.O.O. Anuj Sharma and Head of Rural Operations’  Harish Manwani. In the run up to inauguration, door-to-door community awareness drive had been  organized along with a school competition on water-health linkages. 12 best performing children and  their families were felicitated and were awarded month-long Sarvajal water subscription for free.  Speaking at the inauguration of the COCO Piramal Sarvajal plant in Rakhigarhi, Dr. Shashikant  Mishra said, “Piramal Foundation has always been associated with protecting the culture and  heritage of India. Hence when they decided to support the village of Rakhigarhi which is set to  rewrite the 5000 year old history of our civilization, by installing water purification facility, I agreed  to be present here. It is indeed a noble cause that will go a long way in bettering the lives of the  people of Rakhigarhi”    Piramal Sarvajal an initiative under Piramal Foundation has been dedicatedly delivering affordable  and healthier solutions to the drinking water crisis in the villages and small towns of Rajasthan,  Haryana and Gujarat since 2008.

08-Jul-2014,Piramal Fund Management launches ‘Indiareit Apartment Fund’ ‘ a novel first-to-market fund strategy centered around institutional buying of residential units; collects INR100cr commitments in 10 day,"Press Release      Piramal Fund Management launches ‘Indiareit Apartment Fund’ –  a novel first-to-market fund strategy centered around  institutional buying of residential units; collects INR100cr  commitments in 10 days    July 8th, 2014, Mumbai: Piramal Fund Management has launched a new fund targeting  buying of individual residential units – „Indiareit Apartment Fund‟ seeks to acquire residential  units in Tier 1 markets at a significant discount to prevailing market price, by offering a bulk  purchase to the developers. The target fund size is INR350cr (+ a green-shoe option of a  further INR350cr) with an average deal tenure of 2-3 years per transaction. IIFL Wealth  Management Ltd. is acting as exclusive distributor for the first close.    The Fund is specifically targeted towards those individuals who, beyond a primary home, look  to invest directly into real estate as an asset class. The Fund will therefore underwrite units  only i.e. physical square feet rather than financial participation, whilst adhering to the basic  tenets of a defined use of funds, appropriate security and monitoring as well as ensuring  developer alignment and project completion – key risks that a retail buyer in the open market  would want to address.    This all encompassing strategy helps create an aligned position i.e. a win-win for all  stakeholders. For the developer, this enables them to advance construction and delivery of  initial sales, facilitates an increased visibility of site progress and also enables them, in certain  instances, to participate in the upside beyond a certain price threshold. For the investor, the  Fund enables them to access value deals in the market and participate in a „secured‟ position  with the benefit of a highly attractive price point, diligence and structuring vis a vis an  individual transaction. It also enables a „quicker‟ realization of attractive returns with smaller  incremental price movements when compared with retail participation at open market prices.    The Fund has already seeded its first transaction, a INR50cr investment in Mumbai and has  identified a further pipeline of similar transactions even as the fund raising progresses.    Khushru Jijina, Managing Director, Piramal Fund Management said, “This Fund has been  formed over many months of conceptualization and structuring. We are extremely heartened  with the response having collected INR100cr in a matter of days. This offering adds to our  existing bouquet of services i.e. structured equity, senior debt, and construction finance and  furthers our engagement with development partners to meet their requirements.”  About Piramal Enterprises Limited:    Piramal Enterprises Limited (PEL) is one of India‟s largest diversified companies, with a  presence in pharmaceuticals, healthcare information management and financial services.

18-Jun-2014,Piramal’s NCE Research shared Preclinical efficacy data for Two Promising Molecules at the American Diabetes Association’s 74th Scientific Sessions,"Press Release    PIRAMAL’S NCE RESEARCH SHARED PRECLINICAL EFFICACY DATA FOR TWO PROMISING                                                     TH  MOLECULES AT THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION’S 74 SCIENTIFIC SESSIONS    Mumbai, June 18, 2014: Piramal Life Sciences - NCE Research, a division of Piramal Enterprises Ltd (PEL), made  poster presentations for drugs in early clinical development for metabolic disorders in two different sessions of the  74th Scientific Session of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) in San Francisco, California, USA. The  presentations covered Piramal’s clinical stage GRP40 agonist, P11187 and Piramal’s clinical stage DGAT1 inhibitor  P7435.    P11187 (GPR40 agonist)    The P11187 presentation covered the preclinical pharmacological data in support of efficacy for a novel synthetic  oral GPR40 partial agonist, P11187, which stimulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion.    The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of P11187 to potentiate glucose-dependent insulin  secretion. P11187 orally administered to both normal and diabetic mice and rats showed significant reduction in  blood glucose levels. P11187 treatment in normal rats in the hyperglycemic clamp model results in considerable  increase in glucose infusion rate and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.    P11187 has been found to be a highly selective and potent partial agonist for these GPR40 receptors in humans,  mice and rats. It is being developed for the management of Type II diabetes.    Overall, P11187 has demonstrated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and anti-hyperglycemic potential in rodent  models of type 2 diabetes with excellent safety profile. The drug is currently being tested in Phase I trial in the USA.    Dr. Owe Orwar, President – Piramal Life Sciences-NCE Research, stated, “P11187 is an intelligent oral anti-  diabetic investigational drug that evokes insulin release in a glucose and Free Fatty Acid (FFA) dependent fashion.  This means, the higher the glucose and free fatty acid concentration in the plasma, the better it may work. For  glucose control, this has been corroborated by the Phase III study in type-II Diabetes mellitus with the  investigational drug, Fasiligam (TAK-875), which was the leading molecule in the class until it failed due to  hepatotoxicity in December 2013. We have done extensive work to de-risk our asset for this liability, and will shortly  be initiating our Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) portion of our Phase- I trial in type-II diabetics.”    P7435 (DGAT1 inhibitor)    The P7435 presentation covered the preclinical data in support of efficacy for P7435, a novel, potent and selective,  small molecule DGAT1 inhibitor in rodent models of hyperlipidemia and obesity. It also discussed the clinical results  from a Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of single ascending doses (SAD) of P7435 in  healthy male volunteers conducted in India.    The Phase I trial showed that P7435 was safe and well-tolerated when given in single doses from 10mg to 300mg  to healthy male volunteers. The only adverse effect of the treatment seen was vomiting. The PK profile revealed  that the increase in exposure from 10mg to 300mg of P7435 was dose-linear although less than dose-proportional.    In vivo data suggested that acute treatment with P7435 resulted in significant reduction in plasma triglyceride  levels, and an increase in GLP-1 levels in the plasma along with sitagliptin. An overall reduction was observed in  the body weight, food intake, cholesterol, epididymal fat pad weight, plasma glucose, plasma triglyceride, insulin,  Steatorrhea and liver triglycerides of High Fat Diet (HFD) fed hamsters, ob/ob mice and SD rats when given a  chronic treatment with P7435. On the whole, P7435 showed significant efficacy in rodent models of hyperlipidemia.  The investigational drug is currently moving quickly through a Phase I trial in the US.                                                                Page 1 of 3  Dr. Owe Orwar, President – Piramal Life Sciences NCE Research, stated, “P7435 appears to be one of the  safest DGAT1 inhibitors thus far, showing potent triglyceride-lowering potential. We are well on our way to  concluding a Phase I in trial in the US the next few months and are looking forward to evaluating this molecule  further in clinic and exploit its potential in hypertriglyceridemia, and combined dyslipidemia as well as in type 2  diabetes.    About Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Dyslipidemia:    Diabetes mellitus type 2 is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) in the  context of insulin resistance and relative lack of insulin. Type 2 diabetes makes up about 90% of cases of diabetes,  with the other 10% due primarily to diabetes mellitus type 1 and gestational diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a chronic  disorder wherein maintaining glycaemic control as diabetes progresses, is an ongoing problem as patients fear  initiating new therapies that may increase the risk of side effects such as weight gain and hypoglycaemia chronic  condition.    Dyslipidemia is a disorder of lipoprotein metabolism, including lipoprotein overproduction or deficiency.  Dyslipidemias may be manifested by elevation of the total cholesterol, the ""bad"" low-density lipoprotein (LDL)  cholesterol and the triglyceride concentrations, and a decrease in the ""good"" high-density lipoprotein (HDL)  cholesterol concentration in the blood. Dyslipidemia comes under consideration in many situations including  diabetes, a common cause of lipidemia.    About GPR40 and DGAT:    GPR40 is a G-protein coupled receptor highly expressed in pancreatic beta cells of humans and rodents. It  stimulates insulin-secretion when activated by a free fatty acid under elevated glucose concentrations in the blood.    Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) is an enzyme catalyzes the final step of triglyceride formation from  diacylglycerol and Acyl-CoA. A surplus accumulation of triglycerides in tissues and blood can lead to a range of  medical conditions such as severe obesity, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and cardiovascular disease.  Therefore, inhibition of triglyceride synthesis has a strong therapeutic rational for treatment of such disorders.  P7435 is a potent, selective oral DGAT1 inhibitor, aimed at fulfilling unmet medical needs in hypertriglyceridemia,  and combined dyslipidemia.

10-Jun-2014,Research on Piramal Imaging’s NeuraceqTM (florbetaben F18 injection) takes Center Stage at SNMMI,"Press Release  RESEARCH ON PIRAMAL IMAGING’S NEURACEQ™ (florbetaben  F18 injection) TAKES CENTER STAGE AT SNMMI  Berlin/Boston/Mumbai, June 10, 2014 ‒ Piramal Imaging today released details from  research presented at the Annual Meeting of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular  Imaging (SNMMI), currently underway at St. Louis Convention Center in St. Louis, Mo.    Yesterday, during the AD II: Advanced Approaches Session, research findings relating to the  development and approval of Neuraceq™ (florbetaben F18 injection) took center stage.  Three different presentations in the session revealed findings from discrete studies exploring  the efficacy and application of Neuraceq.    The sessions were just part of the robust line-up of Piramal Imaging data at the show. A  total of 12 SNMMI Scientific Paper presentations and posters are featuring research relating  to Piramal Imaging’s product and pipeline.    “The strength of our partnership with the research community has been on display  throughout SNMMI,” said Dr. Andrew Stephens, Chief Medical Officer, Piramal Imaging. “It  is this partnership that allows us to push the innovation envelope for Piramal and Molecular  Imaging as a field. The research presented here will be the basis for product advancements  for years to come.”    In yesterday’s talks, there was a specific focus on science that improved the understanding  of the value of beta-amyloid imaging as a tool for assessing patients with cognitive  impairment. As independent researchers, these clinical experts discussed uses of beta-  amyloid agents that are not completely reflected in the label approved by the FDA.  Nevertheless, they highlight the exciting emerging science underlying this new diagnostic  tool. The three presentations highlighted below, each led by different key researchers,  offered new insight into the clinical value and application for Neuraceq:       •   In a presentation titled “A negative florbetaben PET scan reliably excludes AD         pathology as confirmed by histopathology,” Dr. John Seibyl of Molecular         NeuroImaging, New Haven, focused on the very high negative predictive value of         Neuraceq scans.       •   In his presentation “Efficacy and reliability of the visual assessment of 18F-         florbetaben PET scans in the detection of beta-amyloid neuritic plaques in the brain,”         Dr. Osama Sabri of the University of Leipzig, Germany, revealed that the robustness         of the visual scan assessment method developed for Neuraceq results in high         sensitivity and specificity even in challenging scans and restrictive reading         conditions.       •   Finally, Dr. Henryk Barthel of the University of Leipzig, Germany, presented “Early ß-         amyloid PET images are a valuable surrogate biomarker of neuronal injury in         dementia patients,” which showed that a single tracer injection may provide         information on both neuronal integrity (as FDG) and beta-amyloid deposition.                                                 1/3                                                                                US/FBB/0614/0029  About Neuraceq  Neuraceq was approved in the US and EU earlier this year. Neuraceq is indicated for  Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of the brain to estimate beta-amyloid neuritic  plaque density in adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for  Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other causes of cognitive decline.    A negative Neuraceq scan indicates sparse to no amyloid neuritic plaques and is inconsistent  with a neuropathological diagnosis of AD at the time of image acquisition; a negative scan  result reduces the likelihood that a patient’s cognitive impairment is due to AD. A positive  Neuraceq scan indicates moderate to frequent amyloid neuritic plaques; neuropathological  examination has shown this amount of amyloid neuritic plaque is present in patients with  AD, but may also be present in patients with other types of neurologic conditions as well as  older people with normal cognition.    Neuraceq is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations.    Limitations of Use  • A positive Neuraceq scan does not establish the diagnosis of AD or any other cognitive     disorder.  • Safety and effectiveness of Neuraceq have not been established for:         o Predicting development of dementia or other neurologic conditions;         o Monitoring responses to therapies.    IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION  Risk for Image Interpretation and Other Errors  Neuraceq can be used to estimate the density of beta-amyloid neuritic plaque deposition in  the brain. Neuraceq is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations. Neuraceq images should  be interpreted independent of a patient's clinical information. Physicians should receive  training prior to interpretation of Neuraceq images. Following training, image reading errors  (especially false positives) may still occur. Additional interpretation errors may occur due to,  but not limited to, motion artifacts or extensive brain atrophy.    Radiation Risk  Administration of Neuraceq, similar to other radiopharmaceuticals, contributes to a  patient´s overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation  exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer. It is important to ensure safe  handling to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure.      Most Common Adverse Reactions  In clinical trials, the most frequently observed adverse drug reactions in 872 subjects with  978 Neuraceq administrations were injection/application site erythema (1.7%), injection site  irritation (1.2%), and injection site pain (3.9%).

About Neuraceq  Neuraceq was approved in the US and EU earlier this year. Neuraceq is indicated for  Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of the brain to estimate beta-amyloid neuritic  plaque density in adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for  Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other causes of cognitive decline.    A negative Neuraceq scan indicates sparse to no amyloid neuritic plaques and is inconsistent  with a neuropathological diagnosis of AD at the time of image acquisition; a negative scan  result reduces the likelihood that a patient’s cognitive impairment is due to AD. A positive  Neuraceq scan indicates moderate to frequent amyloid neuritic plaques; neuropathological  examination has shown this amount of amyloid neuritic plaque is present in patients with  AD, but may also be present in patients with other types of neurologic conditions as well as  older people with normal cognition.    Neuraceq is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations.    Limitations of Use   A positive Neuraceq scan does not establish the diagnosis of AD or any other cognitive     disorder.   Safety and effectiveness of Neuraceq have not been established for:         o Predicting development of dementia or other neurologic conditions;         o Monitoring responses to therapies.    IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION  Risk for Image Interpretation and Other Errors  Neuraceq can be used to estimate the density of beta-amyloid neuritic plaque deposition in  the brain. Neuraceq is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations. Neuraceq images should  be interpreted independent of a patient's clinical information. Physicians should receive  training prior to interpretation of Neuraceq images. Following training, image reading errors  (especially false positives) may still occur. Additional interpretation errors may occur due to,  but not limited to, motion artifacts or extensive brain atrophy.    Radiation Risk  Administration of Neuraceq, similar to other radiopharmaceuticals, contributes to a  patient´s overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation  exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer. It is important to ensure safe  handling to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure.                                                    2/3                                                                                  US/FBB/0314/0012  Most Common Adverse Reactions  In clinical trials, the most frequently observed adverse drug reactions in 872 subjects with  978 Neuraceq administrations were injection/application site erythema (1.7%), injection site  irritation (1.2%), and injection site pain (3.9%).

12-May-2014,AC Immune and Piramal Imaging announce out-licensing agreement for the development of Tau protein diagnostics in Alzheimer’s disease,"PRESS RELEASE  AC Immune and Piramal Imaging announce out-licensing agreement for the  development of Tau protein diagnostics in Alzheimer’s disease    • Potential important step towards better diagnosis and clinical management of    Alzheimer’s disease  • Tau diagnostics complement AC Immune’s therapeutic product pipeline  • Piramal Imaging initiates Tau-PET-Imaging tracer development program  • Significant License Agreement signals the importance of the development of    Alzheimer’s Tau-PET-Imaging tracers    Lausanne, Switzerland/Berlin, Germany and Boston, USA – May 12, 2014 –  AC Immune SA and Piramal Imaging, a division of Piramal Enterprises Ltd., announced  today that they have entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement for the  research, development and commercialization of AC Immune’s Tau protein positron  emission tomography (PET) tracers supporting the diagnosis and clinical management  of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and potential Tau-related disorders.    The formation of Tau tangles in the human brain is recognized as one of two major  hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease pathology, with the other being beta-amyloid plaques.  The development of the Tau tangle pathology appears to correlate well with cognitive  decline, making it a potential strong target for diagnostic approaches. The availability of  a Tau-PET tracer for imaging Tau tangles in the brain of patients would represent  important progress towards relevant diagnostic endpoints and could be of significant  value in guiding clinical trials for disease modifying AD therapeutics.    Under the terms of the agreement, AC Immune will receive an undisclosed upfront  payment and is eligible for significant milestone payments on products achieving  development goals in AD and other Tauopathies. Additionally, AC Immune is entitled to  receive tiered royalties on net sales of products resulting from the partnership.  AC Immune will work in collaboration with Piramal Imaging to efficiently advance several  lead candidates through late pre-clinical radio-pharmacology development. Piramal  Imaging will have global rights for clinical development, manufacturing and  commercialization of a Tau-PET Tracer resulting from the collaboration. Financial details  were not disclosed.    Prof. Andrea Pfeifer, CEO of AC Immune, said: “We are delighted to be working with  Piramal Imaging as a partner of choice given their proven experience in PET tracer  development, especially in the Alzheimer’s field. The collaboration is an important  endorsement of AC Immune’s capacity to develop both diagnostic and therapeutic  agents in managing this devastating disease. This move into diagnostics complements  our Tau therapeutic product pipeline exemplified by the Tau antibody partnership with  Genentech and the first pTau vaccine ACI-35 now in clinical development for AD.                       1/4  Diagnostics is a natural strategic step for the company and is expected to generate  significant and fast revenues from product sales.”    Dr. Ludger Dinkelborg, Director of the Board of Piramal Imaging, added: “This  collaboration with AC Immune is an important next step in our mission to developing  molecular imaging innovations that allow an earlier and more accurate diagnosis of  Alzheimer’s disease. So far there are no approved imaging technologies to detect Tau  protein in patients, presenting a challenge in AD diagnosis and the development of  disease modifying treatments. We are impressed by the quality of AC Immune’s  innovative Tau-PET tracer program and are looking forward to working with the team at  AC Immune, who has a proven track record in effective partnerships,” and continued:  “That AC Immune selected Piramal Imaging as their diagnostic imaging partner shows  we are making good progress towards our goal to become Pharma companies’ partner  of choice for the development of therapy guiding diagnostics in conjunction with their  therapeutic drugs.”    The agreement between the two companies is based on a long-term relationship in  which AC Immune has used Piramal Imaging’s beta-amyloid PET Tracer Neuraceq™ for  imaging beta-amyloid plaques in the brain of patients undergoing Phase I/IIa clinical  testing of AC Immune´s Alzheimer´s vaccine ACI-24.    Neuraceq™ received marketing authorization from the FDA on March 19, 2014 for PET  imaging of the brain to estimate beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density in adult patients  with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for AD and other causes of cognitive  decline. Safety and effectiveness of Neuraceq™ have not been established for  monitoring responses to therapies. Neuraceq™ received similar approval by the EC four  weeks earlier.    About the Tau-PET Imaging program  The innovative new Tau-PET tracers were discovered by AC Immune through its  proprietary Morphomer™ chemistry technology platform. These Morphomers are a novel  class of ligands that specifically target pathological forms of Tau. The excellent brain  uptake and their high selectivity complete their outstanding profile as PET tracers.    About Tau-PET tracers  A brain positron emission tomography (PET) scan is an imaging test of the brain  involving an imaging device and an imaging agent called a PET tracer. No Tau-PET  tracers have received regulatory approval for commercial distribution, which represents  a huge medical need, not only in Alzheimer’s disease but also in other potential  Tauopathies. Once the Tau-PET tracer is introduced to the body, it travels to the brain  and binds to abnormal Tau protein structures (Tau tangles), one of the pathological  hallmarks of AD. The imaging device detects the bound Tau imaging agent and creates  pictures reflecting the amount and distribution of pathological Tau in the brain.  About Alzheimer’s disease                                                                                           2/4  Scientists don’t yet fully understand what causes Alzheimer's disease, but it has become  increasingly clear that it develops because of a complex series of events that take place  in the brain over a long period of time. Two proteins – Tau and beta-amyloid – are  perceived as the major hallmarks of neurodegeneration: tangles and other abnormal  forms of Tau protein accumulate inside the brain cells, while plaques and oligomers  formed by beta-amyloid occur outside the brain cells of people with Alzheimer’s disease  (AD).    AD will be one of the biggest burdens of the future society showing dramatic incidence  rates: every 69 seconds someone in the US develops AD, by mid-century someone will  develop the disease every 33 seconds. Forty-four million people were affected with the  disease worldwide in 2013. In the US AD is now the 6th leading cause of death across  all ages. It was the fifth leading cause of death for those aged 65 and older. Since the  incidence and prevalence of AD increase with age, the number of patients will grow  dramatically with our society getting older. By 2050 we expect that patient numbers will  triple to 135 million worldwide.

30-Apr-2014,NeuraceqTM (florbetaben F18 injection) Data: an Emerging Science Topic at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting in Philadelphia,"Press Release  NeuraceqTM (florbetaben F18 injection) Data: an Emerging  Science Topic at the American Academy of Neurology Annual  Meeting in Philadelphia  Berlin/Boston/Mumbai, April 30, 2014 ‒ Piramal Imaging today announced that data  from its beta-amyloid PET tracer NeuraceqTM clinical trial will be featured as part of  Emerging Science sessions at the 66th American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting at  the Pennsylvania Convention Center Philadelphia, Penn.    A presentation by Marwan Sabbagh MD, FAAN, director of the Banner Sun Health Research  Institute Research and Professor of Neurology at the University of Arizona, will focus on the  diagnostic accuracy of NeuraceqTM as confirmed in a histopathology clinical trial that was  central to the recent US and EU approvals. This should encourage physicians to search for  other causes of cognitive decline and tailor available treatment options.    “The research and testing that showed efficacy and safety of Neuraceq™ was both  exhaustive and rewarding,” said Dr. Ludger Dinkelborg, Director of the Board, Piramal  Imaging. “The results of our histopathology analysis show a high level of correlation  between tracer uptake and presence of beta-amyloid pathology.”    To qualify for one of 10 spots in the Emerging Sciences session, the presented research  must be “new and of sufficient scientific importance to warrant expedited presentation and  publication.” This presentation, will take place Wednesday, April 30, at 6:15 p.m.    Neuraceq™ was approved by the FDA on March 19, 2014, and in the EU on February 20,  2014. It is indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of the brain to  estimate beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density in adult patients with cognitive impairment  who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other causes of cognitive decline.    Important Safety Information  Neuraceq™ can be used to estimate the density of β-amyloid neuritic plaque deposition in  the brain. Neuraceq is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations. Neuraceq images should  be interpreted independent of a patient's clinical information. Physicians should receive  training prior to interpretation of Neuraceq images. Following training, image reading errors  (especially false positive) may still occur. Additional interpretation errors may occur due to,  but not limited to, motion artifacts or extensive brain atrophy.    Radiation Risk  Administration of Neuraceq, similar to other radiopharmaceuticals, contributes to a  patient´s overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation  exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer. It is important to ensure safe  handling to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure.    Most Common Adverse Reactions  In clinical trials, the most frequently observed adverse drug reactions in 872 subjects with  978 Neuraceq administrations were injection/application site erythema (1.7%), injection site  irritation (1.2%), and injection site pain (3.9%).                                              1/2                                                                                 US/FBB/0314/0012  About Piramal Imaging  Piramal Imaging, a division of Piramal Enterprises, Ltd., was formed in 2012 with the  acquisition of the molecular imaging research and development portfolio of Bayer Pharma  AG.

The CMO Leadership Awards are given by Life Science Leader based on the industry leading  research conducted by Nice Insight. They survey over 11,000 buyers of outsourced services  annually to determine perception and awareness scores of CMOs for five different attributes  (i.e. Innovation, Productivity, Quality, Regulatory, and Reliability). Companies achieving top  20 percentile perception scores across these 5 attributes are recognized for their  achievement.      The annual award recognizes those contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) that are  the most highly rated by industry respondents.

The R&D facility in Goregaon,  Mumbai is engaged in drug discovery and development of New Chemical Entities (NCE) in the area  of Oncology and Metabolic Disorders.    Dr. Owe Owar, President – NCE Research, Piramal Enterprises Limited said, “The GLP  certification is a testament to high quality research through thorough SOP-driven Good Laboratory  Practices, competent well-trained personnel and systematic documentation at Piramal’s NCE R&D  facility in Mumbai. Piramal’s NCE R&D unit is committed to realize its mission towards serving  patients globally with medicines that matter.”    The certification states that specified studies in the areas of toxicity, mutagenicity, analytical and  clinical chemistry testing, and others like hERG, bioanalysis and toxicokinetic evaluation conducted  at Piramal Enterprises Ltd are compliant with GLP under OECD principles.    Dr. Swati Piramal, Vice-Chairperson, Piramal Enterprises said, “I am very happy that our  GLP lab has received this certificate. This is a leap forward in the field of quality compliance and  best practices. The GLP laboratories are designed as per OECD guidelines. GLP helps assure the  integrity and quality of the laboratory data used to support a regulatory submission.”    The 3,450-odd sq. ft. GLP facility is a part of 200,000 sq. ft. fully integrated NCE R&D unit which  houses more than 400 scientists. Since its inauguration in June 2012 PEL has made significant  investments in creating this in-house facility with state-of-the-art infrastructure. The GLP  certification will enable PEL to do most of the Investigational New Drug (IND) support studies in-  house, hence shorten the turnaround time for its R&D projects and help it become more cost  efficient. Earlier, PEL used to conduct GLP studies externally. However, now with this in-house  facility it will enable faster access to bio-analytical and toxicology data and better control on  project timelines.  About NCE Research    The NCE Research division of PEL focuses on the discovery and development of innovative small  molecule medicines that matter to patients in the therapy areas of Oncology and Metabolic  Disorders.

24-Feb-2014,Piramal Imaging Announces EU Approval of NeuraCeqTM (florbetaben 18F)* for PET Imaging of Beta-Amyloid Neuritic Plaque Density in the Brain,"Press Release      Piramal Imaging Announces EU Approval of NeuraCeqTM  (florbetaben 18F)* for PET Imaging of Beta-Amyloid Neuritic  Plaque Density in the Brain    Berlin/Boston; February 24, 2014 ‒ Piramal Imaging announced today that NeuraCeq™  has received marketing authorization from the European Commission.    NeuraCeq™ is a radiopharmaceutical indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET)  imaging of beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density in the brains of adult patients with cognitive  impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other causes of  cognitive impairment.    With this authorization, NeuraCeq™ will soon be available to provide valuable information  that may give physicians more confidence in their clinical assessment and help them provide  more personalized patient management as a negative scan may rule out AD as a cause of a  patient's cognitive decline.    “With the prevalence of dementia predicted to grow dramatically in the coming decades, the  global communities are mobilizing to understand the pathology and progression of  Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of cognitive impairment,” said Dr. Ludger Dinkelborg,  Director of the Board, Piramal Imaging. “The approval of NeuraCeq™ in Europe will give  healthcare providers a new tool to aid in the diagnostic assessment of AD and other causes  of cognitive impairment. Our goal from here is to get NeuraCeq™ into the hands of  physicians later this year so they can help ensure timely and accurate assessments for  patients.”    “Our belief in the diagnostic importance of molecular imaging led us to make a strategic  investment in the Bayer research pipeline and create the Piramal Imaging business,” said  Dr. Swati Piramal, Vice Chairperson, Piramal Enterprises, Ltd. “In just two years, we are  already at the approval milestone in Europe for the first of our compounds setting us up to  provide physicians and patients with valuable information about cognitive impairment and  decline. Early diagnosis can be powerful knowledge for certain clinicians and families and  may lead to faster action and better care – all of which we value to our core at Piramal  Enterprises.”    Data from the pivotal phase III autopsy study showed that PET imaging with NeuraCeq™  detects neuritic beta-amyloid in the brains of living subjects. The visual subject-level PET  reading proposed for routine clinical practice compared to histopathology for the first 31  brains demonstrated 100 percent sensitivity and 86 percent specificity. In a post-hoc  analysis in a larger population with 74 autopsied subjects, the sensitivity of the visual  assessment was 98 percent and specificity was 89 percent.    NeuraCeq™ will be available in select European countries in the second and third quarters of  2014.                                                                               EU/FBB/0214/0004  Piramal Imaging has partnered with IBA Molecular for manufacturing and distribution of  NeuraCeq™ upon EU approval. IBA Molecular owns and operates a network of 49 PET  isotope facilities worldwide, a network that is unique in both size and scope.    About NeuraCeq™ (florbetaben 18F)    Indication  This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only.    NeuraCeqTM is a radiopharmaceutical indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET)  imaging of beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density in the brains of adult patients with cognitive  impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other causes of  cognitive impairment. NeuraCeqTM should be used in conjunction with a clinical evaluation.  A negative scan indicates sparse or no plaques, which is not consistent with a diagnosis of  AD. For the limitations in the interpretation of a positive scan, please refer to the SmPC.    Important Safety Information  NeuraCeq™ can be used for the imaging of beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density in the  brain. NeuraCeq™ cannot be used to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease and it cannot predict a  patient’s predisposition for beta-amyloid plaque development in the future. NeuraCeq™  images should only be interpreted by readers trained in the interpretation of PET images  with florbetaben (18F). Following training, image reading errors (including false positive or  false negative interpretation of NeuraCeq™ images) may still occur. Additional interpretation  errors may occur due to image noise, atrophy with a thinned cortical ribbon, or image  blurs.    Administration of NeuraCeq™, as with other radiopharmaceuticals, results in a low amount  of ionizing radiation exposure. Safety precautions should be taken to ensure healthcare  providers and patients do not receive unintentional radiation exposure from NeuraCeq™.    Most Common Adverse Events  The most common side effects observed in clinical trials were injection site reaction and  injection site pain.

The fund, which had a targeted corpus of INR1000 crores (including a greenshoe option of 250  crores) had earlier crossed the basic fund size of INR750 crores in November. In a short span  of a few weeks since, the fund has continued to witness a steady level of applications resulting  in a final close taking place just prior to the end of the year.    Mr. Khushru Jijina, Managing Director – Indiareit said “We are grateful for the  overwhelming support shown by the investor community for our fifth domestic fund. In fact,  despite reaching a final close and hitting our hard cap limit of INR1000 crores we have had to  turn away applications in recent days that saw the Fund being oversubscribed by more than  INR100 crores. At the same time, we are witnessing very healthy levels of deal flow and are  able to pick the best transactions given the real estate market dynamics, our preferred  position and ability to commit relatively quickly. Even whilst announcing the final close of this  fund raises, we have committed 25% of the corpus already and continue to build a pipeline of  very attractive opportunities for the fund.”    The scheme is targeting structured returns and had already deployed 10% of the Fund to its  first deal –a INR100 Crore investment in a joint venture between Ashiana Homes and the  Landcraft Group. The project is located in Sector 88A, Gurgaon which has excellent access  from the existing Pataudi Road, and will benefit from upcoming developments including the  under construction Dwarka Expressway, and the fast growing New Gurgaon region. The regular  shaped land parcel is spread across 14 acres with a total saleable area potential of around  1.5m sq ft. The investment is structured to provide an assured minimum return along with an  equity kicker, and is backed by adequate security cover.    Since then, the Fund has approved two new transactions – the first is aINR60 crore  investments into a residential project in Mumbai and the second, a INR90 crore investment in  Bangalore.

20-Dec-2013,CHMP Recommends EU Approval of Piramal Imaging’s NeuraCeqTM (Florbetaben 18F)* for PET Imaging of Neuritic Beta-Amyloid Plaques in the Brain,"Press Release      CHMP Recommends EU Approval of Piramal Imaging’s NeuraCeqTM  (Florbetaben 18F)* for PET Imaging of Neuritic Beta-Amyloid  Plaques in the Brain  Berlin/Boston/Mumbai, December 20, 2013 ‒ Piramal Imaging announced today the  European Union’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended  approval of NeuraCeqTM (florbetaben 18F). The CHMP's recommendation will now be  referred to the European Commission, for approval in the European Union (EU).    NeuraCeqTM is a radiopharmaceutical indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET)  imaging of neuritic beta-amyloid plaque density in the brains of adult patients with cognitive  impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other causes of  cognitive impairment.    ―This recommendation marks a major milestone for Piramal Imaging in our commitment to  assist in the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and the development of novel tracers for PET  imaging,‖ said Dr. Ludger Dinkelborg, Director of the Board, Piramal Imaging SA. ―This is a  key step towards making this innovative type of imaging more accessible to healthcare  providers and patients across Europe.‖    Earlier this month, G8 health ministers held a dementia summit in London to discuss the  challenges associated with this ―major disease burden‖ that will likely affect one of every  three people during their lifetimes. Despite its prevalence, the root cause of dementia is  often misdiagnosed. As a result, a patient may not receive valuable treatments, or—if a  patient does not have dementia—receive unnecessary and costly treatments that  demonstrate no benefit. Following the summit, the G8 participants issued a communiqué  that asked members to commit to ―making timely diagnosis and early intervention feasible,  affordable and cost effective.‖    ―Alzheimer’s disease is a growing epidemic, with recent data suggesting more than six  million people in Europe and 36 million people worldwide are living with Alzheimer’s,‖ said  Dr. Swati Piramal, Vice Chairperson, Piramal Enterprises Ltd. ―When Piramal Enterprises  acquired Bayer HealthCare's molecular-imaging pipeline in 2012, we were excited about the  potential for NeuraCeqTM as an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations for dementia. It arms  physicians with additional data to help reduce misdiagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and may  have the potential to aid in earlier diagnosis and intervention. We look forward to hearing  the European Commission’s final decision.‖    The CHMP’s positive opinion was based on data from the pivotal phase III autopsy study,  which showed that PET imaging with NeuraCeqTM detects neuritic beta-amyloid in the brains  of living subjects. The visual subject-level PET reading proposed for routine clinical practice  compared to histopathology for the first 31 brains demonstrated 100 percent sensitivity and  86 percent specificity. In a post-hoc analysis in a larger population with 74 autopsied                                                1/3  subjects, the sensitivity of the visual assessment was 98 percent and specificity was 89  percent.    It is important to note, that a positive NeuraceqTM scan does not establish a diagnosis of  Alzheimer's disease or other cognitive disorder. Additionally, the safety and effectiveness of  NeuraceqTM have not been established for predicting the development of dementia or other  neurologic conditions or monitoring responses to therapies.    Piramal Imaging has partnered with IBA Molecular for manufacturing and distribution of  NeuraCeqTM upon EU approval. IBA Molecular owns and operates a network of 54 PET  isotope facilities worldwide, a network that is unique in both size and scope.      About Piramal Imaging SA  Piramal Imaging SA, a division of Piramal Enterprises, Ltd., was formed in 2012 with the  acquisition of the molecular imaging research and development portfolio of Bayer Pharma  AG.

10-Sep-2013,"Piramal | Healthcare to invest $ 11 million in hormonal healthcare production at its Morpeth, UK, facility","PRESS RELEASE                      PIRAMAL | HEALTHCARE TO INVEST $ 11 MILLION IN HORMONAL               HEALTHCARE PRODUCTION AT ITS MORPETH, UK, FACILITY                  Triples the production capacity for hormonal products              One of the largest contract manufacturers in this niche segment        Sept 10, 2013,       Morpeth, UK: Piramal | Healthcare today announced that it is to    invest 11 million USD at its Morpeth, UK facility to triple the production capacity for    hormonal products, including contraceptive pills and hormone replacement therapies.    The expansion, which has been commissioned in response to customer demand and    new business gains, will see the Morpeth site’s production capacity increase by around    2 billion tablets per annum.        Work on the new suite, which will house formulation, packaging coating and tableting    equipment, will commence at the end of 2013, with mechanical completion anticipated    within 12 months and full operations expected to begin following a 6 month validation    period.        This latest investment follows Piramal |Healthcare’s recent announcement that it is to    invest 2.5 million USD at its FDA approved Grangemouth, UK, site to upgrade one of its    antibody drug conjugate (ADC) manufacturing suites, from clinical phase to commercial    grade, in response to customer demand. The upgrade will give Piramal two commercial    grade     ADC   suites   at   the   Grangemouth   facility,   while   retaining   clinical   phase    manufacturing capacity in other suites on site.        “The production of hormonal products is a highly specialised, niche area,” commented    Piramal Enterprises’ Executive Director and COO, Vijay Shah. “The Morpeth facility is    our Centre of Excellence for these products and this expansion will greatly enhance our    offer and potential for growth in this space.

19-Aug-2013,Piramal Imaging provides comments in response to the centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ (Cms’) proposed coverage decision for Beta-Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (Pet),"Press Release    PIRAMAL IMAGING PROVIDES COMMENTS IN RESPONSE TO THE CENTERS FOR  MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES’ (CMS’) PROPOSED COVERAGE DECISION  FOR BETA-AMYLOID POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET)    Boston, August 19, 2013 ‒ Piramal Imaging announced today that the company has  submitted a detailed response to CMS regarding the draft decision to limit Medicare  coverage of beta-amyloid PET imaging in dementia and neurodegenerative disease.1 Piramal  Imaging’s response, originally submitted on Monday, July 29, 2013, has been posted on  CMS’ website as part of the public comment process, which was open through August 2,  2013. As of August 8, 2013, CMS’ website indicated more than 200 people had posted a  response. Although the final decision is not expected before October 2, 2013, Piramal  Imaging strongly encourages the public to continue to submit evidence to CMS showing why  beta-amyloid imaging is a medically necessary diagnostic tool for appropriate Medicare  populations by sending it to CAGInquiries@cms.hhs.gov.    In Piramal Imaging’s letter to CMS signed by Dr. Andrew Stephens, Vice President of Clinical  Research and Development, the company expressed concerns that the CMS draft coverage  decision is overly restrictive and, if finalized in its current form, would place an undue  burden on physicians, patients, and caregivers by delaying the definitive diagnosis of certain  types of dementia and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD).    The letter addresses four specific areas of concern and offers recommendations for  consideration which are highlighted below:    1. Agreement with CMS’s determination that there is a clear benefit to rule out AD in     precisely defined patient populations where a differential diagnosis is clinically difficult     and to distinguish from other forms of dementia, e.g. frontotemporal dementia. Piramal     Imaging has requested Medicare coverage for these patients without requiring     enrollment in a clinical trial.            Clinical presentation of early onset AD can be difficult to distinguish from other          forms of dementia and can be present with many atypical features which obfuscate          the diagnosis.            The results of beta-amyloid PET imaging thus can help the physician with the          differential diagnosis of the patient, leading to identification of other appropriate          treatments and tests to administer. It can help the physician to determine whether          further testing is needed and to select pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic          options for the patient’s treatable conditions, , and it may enable the patient to          forgo potentially futile testing and treatment.            Furthermore, Piramal Imaging believes, that there is a patient population for which          beta-amyloid PET imaging meets the “reasonable and necessary” threshold for the          diagnosis of disease: those patients meeting the Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC)                                              1/3          developed by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) and          the Alzheimer's Association.    2. CMS should establish a clear standard of the level of evidence required to expand     coverage.            CMS should approve any clinical trials that are likely to expeditiously answer one or          several of the three proposed research questions without onerous restrictions. In          particular, CMS should allow for a variety of practical clinical trial designs and          relevant endpoints providing they address and help answer all or at least one of          CMS' research questions.    3. CMS should state in its final decision memo that once a clinical trial meets endpoints as     agreed upon by CMS, they will expand Medicare coverage in a corresponding manner     without any undue delay.            The decision to expand coverage based on the results of a successful clinical trial          should not unnecessarily delay the National Coverage Determination process.          Medicare beneficiaries should not lose access to diagnostic technologies that have          demonstrated clinical benefits in patient outcomes.    4. CMS should not require a postmortem autopsy as an endpoint for any CMS-approved     clinical trial.            Several pivotal autopsy studies demonstrate amyloid imaging agents bind to beta-          amyloid in the brain therefore, further biomarker studies are redundant. According          to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Clinical Research          Standard no. 3, “the research study does not unjustifiably duplicate existing          studies.” Therefore, additional post-mortem autopsy studies would not fulfill the          above AHRQ standard. In addition, many Medicare beneficiaries may          understandably be very uncomfortable or unwilling to agree to such a requirement          to undergo a diagnostic imaging scan.      About Piramal Imaging SA  Piramal Imaging SA, a division of Piramal Enterprises, Ltd., was formed in 2012 with the  acquisition of the molecular imaging research and development portfolio of Bayer Pharma  AG.

15-Aug-2013,Piramal Water Ltd inaugurates the ‘Jaipur Schools Program’,"             Piramal Water Ltd inaugurates the ‘Jaipur Schools Program’           Jaipur Schools Program aims at providing free safe drinking water to 1200 students in Jaipur    August 15, 2013: Piramal Water Pvt Ltd, an initiative under Piramal Foundation today launched its water  ATM services in Jaipur in the presence of Mr Parmeshwar Lal, RAS, CEO Zilla Parishad, Mr Hazari Lal  Nagar, Zilla Pramukh, Jaipur Zilla Parishad, Mr. Paresh Parasnis, Head of Piramal Foundation and Mr. Anuj  Sharma, COO, Sarvajal. The “Jaipur Schools Program” initiative by Sarvajal is in partnership with Michael  and Susan Dell Foundation (MSDF) and the Akshaya Patra Foundation.    Piramal Water Pvt Ltd first planned the three year project, „Jaipur Schools Program‟ plan in the year 2011  under MSDF‟s “Community and School Based Health Improvement Program”. The aim of this project is to  create provisions for safe drinking water at schools especially in the regions with excessive ionic  contamination in groundwater. 15 government schools in Sanganer (Jaipur District), consisting of around  1000 primary school students, were short listed for the project. 6 out of the 15 schools listed, lack reliable  access to power supply. With the inauguration at a Municipal School in Santoshpura District today, Piramal  Water has officially begun working on the first phase of the program aimed at providing free of cost  filtered drinking water in schools.    Underlining the need for access to clean drinking water Mr. Anuj Sharma, COO, Sarvajal said, “We at  Piramal Water conceptualized the Jaipur Schools Program plan in the year 2011. We realized the need for  safe and free drinking water, when we observed the dangerously high levels of ionic contamination in the  ground water. Each child we strongly believe has the right to clean drinking water; it is essential for their  health. With the installation of the Water ATMs at these schools we will be able to showcase the promise  of decentralized solutions untouched by centralised provisions therefore addressing one of the most  pressing issue of the country; access to clean drinking water.”    The Water ATM is essentially a modular RFID controlled standalone water dispensing unit. It is very simple  to use, and like any usual ATM the customer swipes a prepaid card on the screen and chooses the amount  of water he/she wishes to dispense. The water is filtered through 5 stages and the quality is in accordance  with the international drinking water standard. A total of 1200 students will be benefited by this initiative.

The fund, which has a  targeted corpus of INR 1000 crore, has already reached a close of INR 300 crore. Scheme V is the sixth in  the series of funds raised by Indiareit who already manages / advises a total corpus of INR 4,343 crore  across five earlier funds and two third party mandates. The Scheme is targeting structured returns to take  advantage of the mismatch between the availability of capital and the demand for it. The investment  underwriting therefore, focuses on not just the quality of the project, visibility of cash flows and track  record of the development partner, but also adds an extra layer of security to enhance the risk return  profile.    Mr. Khushru Jijina, Managing Director - Indiareit said, “We are humbled with the momentum and  support our Domestic Scheme V has garnered in the market. Despite a tough fund raising environment,  the speed of the interim close is testament to the quality of our sponsor, track record of the platform and  our constant endeavour to always act in fiduciary capacity for our ever growing family of investors.”    Indiareit's most recent offering, the Mumbai Redevelopment Fund has also reached its targeted corpus of  INR 500 crore. The Fund, which had raised INR 400 crore until a couple of months ago, has seen  continued interest since and was fully subscribed in the previous month thereby reaching a final close. The  Fund targets a niche strategy focused on slum and redevelopment projects in Mumbai and has already  committed around 40 percent of its corpus.    About Piramal Enterprises Ltd.

25-Jul-2013,The centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) draft decision could limit patient access to new technology that may help in diagnosing dementia,"Press Release    THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) DRAFT DECISION COULD LIMIT  PATIENT ACCESS TO NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT MAY HELP IN DIAGNOSING DEMENTIA    Piramal Imaging Urges Public Participation During the CMS Public Comment Period on the use of Beta-  Amyloid Imaging in Dementia    Berlin/Boston/Mumbai, July 25, 2013 ‒ On Wednesday, July 3, 2013, the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) released its proposed decision memorandum regarding  the use of beta-amyloid imaging in dementia and neurodegenerative disease.1    Piramal Imaging is concerned about CMS’ proposal, which appears to take an overly  cautious approach to expanding Medicare coverage for positron emission tomography (PET)  tracers to include beta-amyloid imaging agents. Limiting Medicare coverage only to patients  enrolled in CMS-approved clinical trials imposes restrictions that reduce patient access to  long-awaited diagnostic tools.    “We are concerned that the CMS draft coverage decision is too restrictive and, if finalized in  its current form, will place an undue burden on physicians, patients and caregivers by  delaying the definitive diagnosis of certain types of dementia and neurodegenerative  disease, including Alzheimer’s,” said Dr. Ludger Dinkelborg, Director of the Board, Piramal  Imaging SA.    In Piramal Imaging’s view, the CMS decision needs to be reviewed for the following reasons:          The draft decision does not reference the Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) that was         developed by the Society for Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) and         the Alzheimer’s Association. The taskforce was comprised of a cross-section of         experts including radiologists, nuclear medicine specialists and neurologists.2        It lacks clear guidance on clinical trial designs that should be practical and provide         CMS with the requested evidence in a reasonable timeframe.        There is general disagreement with the relevance of autopsy as an appropriate         endpoint to demonstrate clinical utility in the intended population.    The use of new beta-amyloid imaging agents should help to reduce uncertainties in the  diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, which is of importance for patients  and their caregivers. Piramal Imaging is hopeful that CMS will moderate its position when it  renders its final decision by finding less restrictive ways to gather the information it seeks  regarding health outcomes.    CMS is accepting public comments on its proposed decision from all stakeholder groups and  is accepting public comments now through August 2, 2013. Comments can be posted at:  http://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/indexes/nca-open-and-closed-  index.aspx.                                                   1/3  “We urge anyone concerned with Alzheimer’s disease—patients, caregivers, healthcare  professionals, patient advocacy groups and the general public—to share opinions on the  value of beta-amyloid PET imaging during the initial 30-day public comment period,” said  Dr. Dinkelborg. “Every letter will have an impact on CMS’ final decision in September.”    About the value of beta-amyloid PET imaging  Today, Alzheimer's disease is usually diagnosed after a person with a cognitive impairment  undergoes an extensive clinical examination which typically includes family and medical  history, physical and neurological examinations, laboratory tests, and imaging procedures  such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Still, a  definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can only be made after death where an autopsy  can reveal the presence of beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain.  However, post-mortem studies looking for accumulations of beta-amyloid in the brain have  shown that 10 to 30 percent of diagnoses based on clinical examinations are incorrect.    Beta-amyloid PET imaging holds the promise to detect beta-amyloid plaques in live patients.  Because beta-amyloid progresses in the brain for as long as a decade before classic signs  and symptoms Alzheimer’s disease become clear to diagnosticians, early detection of the  pathophysiology in symptomatic patients is crucial to a more accurate assessment of the  patient’s condition, which may lead to a targeted and accurate therapeutic approach for  those affected.    About Piramal Imaging SA  Piramal Imaging SA, a division of Piramal Enterprises, Ltd., was formed in 2012 with the  acquisition of the molecular imaging research and development portfolio of Bayer Pharma  AG. By developing novel PET tracers for molecular imaging, Piramal Imaging is focusing on  a key field of modern medicine. Piramal Imaging strives to be a leader in the Molecular  Imaging field by developing innovative products that improve early detection and  characterization of chronic and life threatening diseases, leading to better therapeutic  outcomes and improved quality of life. Piramal Imaging’s beta-amyloid PET tracer,  florbetaben F18, is currently being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and  European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in the visual detection of beta-amyloid in the  brains of adults with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease  (AD) and other causes of cognitive decline.

14-May-2013,Piramal Enterprises Limited receives IND approval from the US FDA for its GPR40 agonist P11187; an anti-diabetic molecule,"Press Release    Piramal Enterprises Limited receives IND approval from the US FDA for its GPR40  agonist P11187; an anti-diabetic molecule             P11187 Investigational New Drug (IND) dossier receives US FDA regulatory approval           Piramal’s first US FDA approved Diabetes Phase I clinical trial; trials in the US to be initiated         shortly           P11187’s anti-diabetic action is in a glucose-dependent manner, thus decreasing the         potential risks of hypoglycemia        Mumbai, May 14, 2013: Piramal Enterprises Limited “PEL” (NSE: PEL, BSE: 500302) announced  today that it has received approval from the US FDA for its Investigational New Drug (IND)  P11187. This approval will enable PEL to initiate a Phase I clinical trial of P11187 in healthy  volunteers in the US.    P11187 is an orally active, small molecule New Chemical Entity (NCE), discovered and developed  by the NCE Research Division of PEL. P11187 selectively acts on GPR40; a potential therapeutic  target for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). T2DM is an emerging worldwide health crisis with an  incidence rate of 300 million by 2025 as predicted by the WHO and accounts for about 90% of the  diabetic population.    P11187 will be tested for safety and its glucose-lowering properties for the first time in humans;  both properties having been well-established in our preclinical studies. Currently, the T2DM  treatment space has limitations in terms of efficacy and adverse side-effect profiles. The  advantage of P11187; as a GPR40 agonist, is the stimulation of insulin secretion in a  glucose-dependent manner, thus reducing the potential risk of excess insulin production.    Dr. Swati Piramal, Vice Chairperson, Piramal Enterprises Limited said, “The NCE Research  division of PEL is dedicated to finding new cures for metabolic disorders. It focuses upon nurturing  innovation and break-through thinking to impact the lives of millions of people. P11187’s IND  approval by the US FDA; recognizes our untiring efforts to identify candidates that would translate  into more efficacious drugs for the effective management of diabetes.”  About NCE Research    The NCE Research Division of Piramal Enterprises Limited focuses on the discovery and  development of innovative small molecule medicines to improve the lives of patients suffering from  cancer, metabolic disorders and inflammatory conditions. The key elements of our strategy include  capitalizing on Piramal’s strengths, in particular the India advantage, and leveraging external  partnerships to achieve high levels of R&D productivity. Piramal’s state-of-the-art Research Centre  in Mumbai has comprehensive capabilities spanning target identification all the way through clinical  development.

02-Apr-2013,Indiareit announces investments totaling INR 200 crore across two domestic funds," Indiareit announces investments totaling INR 200 crore across two                            domestic funds           First investment of INR 100 crore in Mumbai with Omkar Realtors on behalf of the         Mumbai Redevelopment Fund           Second investment of INR 100 crore in projects across Pune, Bangalore and Mumbai         with Marvel Group on behalf of Domestic Scheme IV      Mumbai; 2nd April 2013: Indiareit Fund Advisors, the real estate private equity arm of  Piramal Enterprises, today announces two investments totaling INR 200 crore.    The first transaction, which also marks the first deal for the recently closed INR 400 crore  Mumbai Redevelopment Fund, is a INR100 crore investment into a marquee project being  developed by Omkar Realtors in Bhoiwada, Central Mumbai. The project is spread across a  land area in excess of 17 acres, and has a potential free sale component of 25 lakh square  feet, comprising six 40-60 storied residential buildings. The project was launched to  exceptionally strong pre-sales a few months prior on the back of close proximity to  established business districts and strong connectivity with both existing and proposed  infrastructure such as the Eastern Freeway and the Mono Rail. Currently, the construction  for the same is in full swing.    The second transaction is a INR 100 crore investment with Pune based Marvel Group, from  Indiareit Domestic Scheme IV which has a total corpus of INR 900 crore. Marvel Group has  already delivered 1.3mn sq ft (16 projects) with another 15.3m sq ft (38 projects) under  construction. Indiareit’s investment is tied to a basket of pre-identified city centric projects  across Pune, Bengaluru and Mumbai that are in various stages of construction and delivery.  The investment is structured to provide an appropriate return over a defined hold period  along with adequate security cover. All the projects are situated in city centric locations and  benefit from ease in sanctions and approvals and strong end-user demand leading to  relatively quick turnaround times.    Khushru Jijina, Managing Director - Indiareit, a private equity arm of Piramal  Enterprises said, “Both these transactions are representative of the attractive returns that  we are able to structure in the market today, with the added benefit of mechanisms in place  to protect downside and provide adequate security cover. Capital is scarce and our  understanding of the real estate space and our resultant ability to add value allows us to  create rewarding partnerships with developers in projects where both the demand feasibility  and the execution capability are already established.”    Babulal Varma, Managing Director - Omkar Realtors said, “Around two years ago,  Indiareit was the first Private Equity partner to join hands with Omkar through an  investment into our Worli redevelopment project which is currently progressing extremely  well. They had the conviction and understanding to be a torch bearer in terms of  underwriting the risks relevant to our business from a private equity perspective. Following  on from that experience, they successfully raised a fund to solely target redevelopment in  Mumbai. I am pleased that the new fund has also invested with us as we greatly value  Indiareit’s contributions and value-add as a partner of choice for Omkar.”    Vishwajeet Jhavar, CEO - Marvel Group said, “We are pleased to be partnering with  Indiareit who have demonstrated a depth of understanding of real estate that we found to  be unique.”    Separately, Indiareit is also pleased to report that distributions have begun from the INR  440 crore of exits that were term sheeted three months ago with the first transaction (an  SEZ in Hinjewadi, Pune) having secured the necessary government approvals to facilitate  closure. The remaining exits are also on track to close/distribute within the next two  months.

Today, Alzheimer's disease is usually diagnosed after a person with a cognitive impairment  undergoes an extensive clinical examination which typically includes family and medical  history, physical and neurological examinations, laboratory tests, and imaging procedures  such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Still, a  definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can only be made after death where an autopsy  can reveal the presence of beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain.  However, post-mortem studies looking for accumulations of beta-amyloid in the brain have  shown that 10 to 30 percent of diagnoses based on clinical examinations are incorrect. [18F]  florbetaben is being studied to determine its potential ability to detect beta-amyloid  plaquesin living subjects with cognitive impairment.    The submission of [18F] florbetaben is based on the results of a broad clinical program  including a pivotal multi-center Phase III trial. This was the first study of a direct  comparison between in-vivo PET imaging of the brain using [18F] florbetabenandthe post-  mortem analysis of brain tissue. The study was performed to confirm that [18F] florbetaben  binds to beta-amyloid in the brain at the regional level and is diagnostically useful on the  subject to exclude Alzheimer’sdisease. The presence of beta-amyloid in histopathological  sections taken from the brains of deceased subjects was directly matched to [18F]  florbetaben uptake in the identical regions of interest.The visual assessment procedure  proposed for routine clinical practice demonstrated 100% sensitivity, 92% specificity, and  excellent inter-reader agreement (kappa = 0.88). In addition, a subsequent study looked  across 461 images from Phase I, II, and III studies to validate that the visual assessment  method, taught by an electronic tool, is reliable (kappa = 0.87).                                              1/3  ""The acceptance for reviewof [18F] florbetaben marks an important milestone in our clinical  research on Alzheimer’s disease. The addition of [18F] florbetaben PET imaging to the  current clinical evaluation of people suffering from cognitive decline may help to increase  the diagnostic confidence of physicians addressing a significant medical need by providing  earlier and more robust information to people and their caregivers. We also see a potential  for our product to contribute in the future to the early detection of Alzheimer's disease and  facilitate specific treatment decisions,"" said Dr. Ludger Dinkelborg, Director of the Board,  Piramal Imaging SA. Renaud Dehareng, Chief Executive Officer of IBA Molecular, also  welcomed the acceptance for reviewof [18F] florbetaben. In 2012 IBA Molecular and Piramal  Imagingsigned an agreement to the effect that IBA Molecular would manufacture and  distribute [18F] florbetaben upon regulatory approval in both the United States and Europe.  The company owns and operates a network of 54 PET isotope facilities worldwide, a network  that is unique in both size and scope. Dehareng said,""We believe our network of PET isotope  facilities is well positioned to maximize patient access to [18F] florbetaben and is strongly  committed to providing our customers and their patients with the best quality product and  service possible.""                                                       *****          For media enquiries please contact:  Tammy Best  Marketing Communications Manager  Piramal Enterprises – Imaging Division  Contact: +1 1-617-557-1750  tammy.best@piramal.com    Akansha Pradhan  Corporate Communications  Piramal Group  Contact: +91 3351 4082  akansha.pradhan@piramal.com    Notes to the editors:    About florbetaben  18  [ F] florbetaben is an 18F-labeled tracer for use in positron emission tomography (PET) which  specifically binds to beta-amyloid deposits in the brain, a key pathological hallmark in Alzheimer's  disease. A Phase III trial presented for the first time at the annual meeting of the American Academy                                                       18  of Neurology in 2012 showed that PET imaging with [ F] florbetaben detects beta-amyloid in the                                                     2/3  brains of living subjects.

About Alzheimer's disease  Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease which primarilyaffects people over the  age of 60 and is the most common cause of dementia. In 2009 estimates suggested that more than  36 million people worldwide were suffering from Alzheimer's. This figure could exceed 115 million by  2050. At present there is no cure for the disease, although treatments which may help with certain  symptoms, combined with the right services and support, can improve the quality of life for the  millions of people living with Alzheimer's.

These exits have been executed under the  leadership of Mr Khushru Jijina, who was re-inducted to oversee Indiareit as Managing  Partner three months ago. This is a strong validation of Indiareit's commitment to work  immediately on prioritizing investor returns across all of its advised / managed funds and  adds to the INR 905 crore that the fund house has already returned from previous exits in  earlier vintage funds and third party mandates.    Mr. Khushru Jijina, Managing Partner, Indiareit said ""The Piramal Group strongly  believes that we are custodians of our investors and in our fiduciary capacity, we felt it  appropriate that we give due attention and importance to a renewed focus on exits from our  2006-7 vintage fund vehicles. We have initiated discussions with our development  counterparts in order to prioritize such exits with a view towards final realizations keeping in  mind the various fund tenures.""    The first is a phased stake sale of an SEZ within a successful township project located at  Hinjewadi, Pune, being developed by Paranjape Schemes. The entire SEZ has a total  development potential of 2.9 million sq ft of which 1.48 million sq ft (Phase I) is currently  built and leased to marquee tenants like Accenture, Cisco, L&T, Persistent, KPIT and Crisil.  Indiareit had invested INR 242 crore for a 30% shareholding in the project back in 2007.  The residential portion has witnessed strong absorption levels and construction is well  underway, with more than 400 units already having been handed over to the end users.    The second, is an investment in Mumbai with the Ariisto Group in a residential project at  Santacruz as well as a mixed use project at Goregaon. Ariisto Sapphire, a 83 unit premium  luxury development has been completed and handed over and well received by the micro  market. The Retail portion of the Goregaon project has been constructed and is in the  process of being leased out even as the residential portion is currently under construction.  Indiareit had invested INR 150 crore across both these projects back in 2008 and has  already realized INR 117 crore with another approximately INR 190 crore expected to come  in within the next quarter.    Additionally as advisors to the offshore manager, Indiareit has been advising on the  proposed exit in Forest Trails, a 3mn sq ft residential township located at Bhugaon in Pune  also being developed by Paranjape Scheme, for which a term sheet has been executed by  the Offshore Fund. The first phase of 160 villas has been completed and handed over and  the second phase, comprising apartment units has been launched to healthy pre-sales. The  Offshore Fund had invested INR 109 crore for a 50% stake in the project in January 2011,  with the exit amount translating into an IRR of 20% over the two year tenure.    Mr. Shrikant Paranjape, Chairman, Paranjape Schemes (Construction) Ltd. said  ""Paranjape’s association with both the Fund as well as the Group at large goes back a long  way - we have done several deals together and greatly value the opinion and expertise of  the team directly overseeing our assets. We hope to continue the same relationship going  forward and, as in the past, and look forward to a mutually beneficial association""    Finally, Indiareit has also advised on the exit from an investment held by Trafalgar / F&C  REIT, one of the offshore managed accounts. The investment in question is located off the  L&T Bypass road in Coimbatore and is classified as a plotted residential development.    Mr. David Cohen, Chairman, F&C REIT India said, ""F&C REIT has been truly impressed  with the way Indiareit has handled our projects since the commencement of our  professional relationship. The team has consistently exercised diligence, creativity, and a  high level of emotional and intellectual intelligence. We look forward to continuing to work  with them to harvest optimally our existing portfolio and to exploring further business  opportunities with the Piramal Group.""

This anesthetic product range is developed and currently manufactured by  BSV at its own plant.    In a hospital setting Propofol is used for “Induction / Initiation of Anesthesia” while  Bupivacaine is used for local anesthesia. Atracurium Besylate is used to provide  muscle relaxation during surgery. The business had sales of Rs. 106 million in FY2010  out of which around 80% is accounted for by Propofol.    The acquisition gives Piramal access to key intellectual property developed by BSV for  the manufacture of injectible anesthetics products including process-based intellectual  property and business contracts. The acquisition provides Piramal an immediate entry  into the Propofol market, the largest selling injectible anesthetic globally. As per IMS, the  total market size of Propofol is approximately US $ 825 million. The market excluding  Europe/US/Japan is approximately US $ 250 million.    Piramal is a leading producer of inhalation anesthetics such as sevoflurane, enflurane,  halothane and isoflurane. The acquisition of injectible anesthetic product portfolio will  strengthen the overall product offering. BSV currently sells the injectible anesthetic  products in 30 countries including India, Russia, Columbia and Ukraine. The reach and  span of this business will now be expanded significantly given Piramal’s strong  marketing and sales network across 108 countries with 178 distributors.    As per the terms of the agreement, BSV will enter into a long-term manufacture and  supply agreement with Piramal Healthcare for anesthetic products developed and  manufactured by BSV.    Commenting on the acquisition, Mr. Ajay Piramal, Chairman, Piramal Group said, “At  Piramal Healthcare, we are committed to building a strong global presence in critical  care.

Daftary, Chairman & Managing Director, Bharat Serums and Vaccines Limited  said: “We are very pleased to partner with Piramal Healthcare for marketing of our  anesthetic products. BSV has built a strong presence globally for its anesthetic product  range and Piramal’s focus on anesthetics will build on our foundation of product  development and marketing, adding value to both companies.

11-May-2008,Piramal Diagnostics introduces Asia’s first high-definition,"                                   PRESS RELEASE              Piramal Diagnostics introduces Asia's first high-definition                                      PET/CT Scanner    ~ PET offers advanced imaging solutions to detect cancer at an early stage ~        Mumbai, 11 May 2008: NPIL Laboratories and Diagnostics Private Limited  (“NLDL”, name proposed to be changed to Piramal Diagnostic Services Private  Limited), a Piramal Group Company, today introduced Asia’s first high-definition  PET (Positron Emission Topography) / CT (Computed Tomography) Scanner to  mark National Technology Day, celebrated by the Govt. of India since 1998.  PET/CT is functional imaging equipment, while the conventional CT scan detects  structural imaging. With this revolutionary technology, it is now possible to  recognise lesions as small as 2 mm, thus helping to diagnose diseases more  accurately at an early stage. The Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, Mr.  T.K.A. Nair, today formally inaugurated the PET/CT at the Piramal Diagnostics  Wellspring centre at Lower Parel in Mumbai.      Speaking at the inauguration, Mr. Ajay Piramal, Chairman, Piramal Group, said,  “Over 400,000 Indians lose their lives to cancer every year and the disease is  growing at 11% annually PET/CT imaging has rapidly emerged as an important  imaging tool in oncology. The success of PET/CT imaging is based on several  features. Firstly, patients benefit from a comprehensive diagnostic whole-body  survey in a single session. Secondly, it provides more accurate diagnostic  information than CT alone.”      The high definition PET/CT Scanner has the unique ability to assess the  functional and biochemical processes of the body’s tissues, which are altered in  the earliest stages of virtually all diseases. PET/CT detects these changes before  anatomical or structural changes that are eventually detected by MRI or CT scan.  PET has been used extensively to study cellular metabolism in the brain, heart  and malignant tumours. A PET scan is considered particularly effective in  evaluating cancer. It is a useful tool for identifying if cancer is present, if it is  spreading, if it is responding to treatment and if a person is cancer free after  treatment.  Wellspring is now CAP (College of American Pathologists) accredited, which is  the highest accreditation for any pathology lab. The procedures and quality  followed by Wellspring are at par with the best centres in the world.      The entire process to obtain CAP accreditation takes anything between 12-18  months. After the accreditation is granted, periodic surveillance audits take place  to ensure that quality and processes are in line with international standards.

23-Jul-2007,"Nicholas Piramal India Limited’s IND-P276- a new drug discovery from Mumbai, India has been approved by USFDA","                               PRESS RELEASE      Nicholas Piramal India Limited’s IND-P276- a new drug discovery from  Mumbai, India has been approved by USFDA    Clinical trials will start at Harvard University’s Dana Farber Cancer Institute  for Multiple Myeloma - a devastating type of cancer    Mumbai, 23 July 2007:Nicholas Piramal India Limited (NPIL) announced today that the  USFDA has approved its Investigational New Drug (IND) application of its lead cancer  compound P 276-00 to treat Multiple Myeloma, a deadly form of blood cancer. It is the  first IND from India for a NCE cancer drug approved by the USFDA.    Multiple Myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematologic malignancy, and is  responsible for at least 2% of cancer-related deaths. MM remains an incurable disease  for most patients, with a median survival of 4 to 5 years. High-dose chemotherapy  followed by transplantation has resulted in improvement in response rates and survival  compared with conventional therapy, but relapse is nearly universal and not all patients  are candidates for this option of aggressive treatment.    It is estimated that there would be 16,570 new cases of MM diagnosed in the United  States and 11,310 deaths attributed to this disease in 2006.More than 20,000 cases of  MM are detected every year in India. Despite the availability of novel agents, MM  remains incurable and most patients die from disease progression. P 276-00 is a new  chemical entity that blocks pathways necessary for cancer cell growth and survival.    The Clinical Studies will be coordinated by Dr Kenneth Anderson -a world-renowned  authority in Multiple Myeloma. The Principal Investigator of the trial will be Dr. Noopur  Raje, M.D., at the Dana Farber - Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. Noopur Raje is  part of the Jerome Lipper Cancer center at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Two  additional sites – St. Vincent's Hospital, New York and Emory University Medical Center  in Atlanta will also participate in this study. It is to be noted that recently India's former  Prime Minister Mr. Chandrasekhar succumbed to this devastating type of cancer.    Dr. (Mrs.) Swati Piramal, Director – Strategic Alliances & Communications, NPIL said, ""It  is a proud moment for Indian research and an important milestone because a drug  discovered in Mumbai India, with global patents is now approved for Clinical studies in  world- renowned cancer hospitals in the USA. It is a testament to the world-class quality  of the regulatory dossiers and preclinial studies which were completed entirely by the  Indian scientific team. It also shows NPIL is delivering on the investments being made in  research.""                                                       ****  For further information contact:  Vijay Sathye                                                    Ganesh Somwanshi  Sagar Gokani                                                    Imprimis Life PR  Nicholas Piramal India Limited                                  Contact: +91-9819726282  Contact: +91-22-3046 6412/3046 6474                             imprimislife@gmail.com  investorrelations@nicholaspiramal.co.in      About Nicholas Piramal India Limited:  Nicholas Piramal India Limited (""NPIL"") is one of India's largest pharmaceutical companies with a  growth track record of above 30% CAGR since 1988.
