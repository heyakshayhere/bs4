In remembrance, I ask all Boeing employees to join me in taking a few, solemn moments on Friday to remember those lives lost. The memories of those 189 victims, as well as the 157 people who lost their lives on Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, drive the important work we do and forever remind us of the trust the flying public places in us to bring them to their destination safely. Across Boeing, we must continue to learn from our past, let our strong values guide us, and honor the memories of those lives lost by ensuring a steadfast focus on safety, quality, integrity and transparency in all we do.      As we share an update on our company’s performance today, I want to thank you for your resilience and dedication. You’ve continued to bring your best to Boeing each and every day. Thanks to your teamwork and tireless efforts, we’re making progress.      Our commercial market is showing improved signs of recovery with vaccine distribution and border protocols beginning to open. As demand returns, supply chain capacity and global trade will be key drivers of our industry and the global economy's recovery.      In the third quarter, we posted our second consecutive positive earnings from operations, demonstrating our recovery is taking hold. While progress is encouraging, we also recorded charges and expenses that negatively impacted results, reinforcing the importance of our efforts to enhance our own performance and drive stability in our operations.       As we work our way through this pivotal time for Boeing, we’re taking meaningful actions to strengthen engineering excellence, enhance quality and drive stability throughout our production system and in the supply chain. These efforts often help us identify where we can improve. While that can impact near-term results, it demonstrates our relentless focus on safety, quality and the long-term health of our business.       For example, in Commercial Airplanes on the 787 program, I know this important work has impacted our deliveries. While we never want to disappoint or cause delays for our customers, quality and safety always come first – and I am proud of our team for the detailed and rigorous work they’re completing to ensure we meet the highest standards, while communicating transparently with our regulators, customers and suppliers. Although this effort lowered revenue in the quarter and drives increased expenses, these actions are essential to bolstering the long-term health of the program and are preparing us for sustained growth and success as market demand returns.      This same focus has started to prove out on the 737 MAX. During the third quarter, we delivered 62 737s, the most since the first quarter of 2019. Since the FAA's approval to return the 737 MAX to operations, we have delivered more than 195 737 MAX aircraft; and airlines have returned more than 200 previously grounded airplanes to service, safely flying more than 500,000 flight hours. Demand also remains strong, and we have achieved eight straight months of positive net orders, largely driven by the 737. To meet this demand, we’re now producing at a rate of 19 airplanes per month, and plan to steadily increase that rate to 31 per month in early 2022.       Similarly, we’re increasing freighter production and conversion capacity to meet the robust and fast growing demand for air cargo due to the surge in e-commerce. This quarter, we received 24 additional freighter orders; and between new and converted freighter orders this year, we have already surpassed the highest annual freighter order tally in our history.       Global Services had another strong quarter with improved revenue and earnings, as the team continues to perform and recover from the impacts of COVID-19. We captured orders for 12 additional 737-800 converted freighters, and also expanded a partnership to increase capacity for 767-300 Boeing Converted Freighters. Underscoring the strength of our government services portfolio, we also received a U.S. Department of Defense award for performance-based logistics support of the global C-17 fleet, and a modification award for Chinook infrared suppression systems for the U.K. Armed Forces.      Defense, Space and Security also continued to meet key milestones. The team successfully conducted MQ-25 unmanned aerial refueling of a U.S. Navy E-2D and F-35C; and delivered 37 aircraft in the quarter, including the first CH-47F Chinook to the Royal Australian Army. We also recorded an earnings charge on the Commercial Crew program, driven by the second uncrewed Orbital Flight Test now anticipated in 2022 and the latest assessment of remaining work. The safety of the Starliner spacecraft, our employees and our crew members remains our number one priority and we are taking the time to work through the process now to set this system up for success on OFT-2 and all future Starliner missions.      Defining our Next Chapter       As we focus on delivering for our customers, we’re also advancing technologies and digital manufacturing capabilities to drive our next generation of products and a more sustainable future.       We’re progressing in development across several key franchise defense programs, and on the 737-7, 737-10 and 777X development and certification efforts. We’re also evaluating the timing of a freighter version of the 777X and are beginning to lay the foundation for our next commercial airplane development program.       This quarter, we stood up our dedicated Integrated Product Team to bring together a digital environment where the next new airplane and production system can be designed together. The effort builds upon years of experience and digital learnings across Boeing, including most recently on the T-7A Red Hawk - the first aircraft designed, built and tested along a digital thread using model-based engineering for the United States Air Force. This will be an enterprise effort and all business units and major functions will play a role.      Looking forward, we are maintaining, and in some cases expanding, key investments that will define our future. Whether we’re investing in manufacturing technology, digital environments, technology advances, supply chain capability or platform designs – sustainability will be a key factor in every decision.      And in support of these initiatives and more, we are investing in our people and focusing on attracting, engaging and developing our employees to ensure Boeing is always a unique place to build your career.      Employee Health and Safety       As we navigate together through the pandemic, ensuring the health and safety of our global workforce remains a core priority. The actions we’ve taken including implementing new safety measures, expanding access to vaccine and healthcare resources, and adapting our approach to virtual work, have all helped support our people, our industry and our communities.       As you know, after careful review and consideration, and to ensure compliance with President Biden’s recent executive order, we are implementing a requirement for U.S.-based employees to either show proof of being fully vaccinated from COVID-19, or have an approved disability, medical condition or religious accommodation in place. We are fully committed to assisting our teammates in meeting this requirement, and have dedicated resources and services for employees.       I am proud to be on your team and thank you for all that you do to support our customers, our company, our communities and each other. We’re making meaningful progress, and I am confident in our future.

Operating cash flow improved to in the quarter, reflecting higher commercial deliveries, higher order receipts, and lower expenditures (Table 2). Operating cash flow was also favorably impacted by a income tax refund in the quarter.  Cash and investments in marketable securities decreased to , compared to at the beginning of the quarter, primarily driven by debt repayment and operating cash outflows (Table 3). Debt was , down from at the beginning of the quarter due to the repayment of maturing debt.  Commercial Airplanes third-quarter revenue increased to .5 billion primarily driven by higher 737 deliveries, partially offset by lower 787 deliveries. Third-quarter operating margin improved to (15.5) percent primarily due to higher deliveries (Table 4).  Boeing is continuing to make progress on the global safe return to service of the 737 MAX. Since the FAA's approval to return the 737 MAX to operations in , Boeing has delivered more than 195 737 MAX aircraft and airlines have returned more than 200 previously grounded airplanes to service. 31 airlines are now operating the 737 MAX, safely flying over 206,000 revenue flights totaling more than 500,000 flight hours (as of ). The 737 program is currently producing at a rate of 19 per month and continues to progress towards a production rate of 31 per month in early 2022, and the company is evaluating the timing of further rate increases.  The company continues to focus 787 production resources on conducting inspections and rework and continues to engage in detailed discussions with the FAA regarding required actions for resuming delivery. The current 787 production rate is approximately two airplanes per month. The company expects to continue at this rate until deliveries resume and then return to five per month over time. The low production rates and rework are expected to result in approximately of abnormal costs, of which was recorded in the quarter.

At quarter-end, Boeing Capital's net portfolio balance was . The earnings from FAS/CAS service cost adjustment primarily reflects an increase in the CAS discount rate driven by pension relief provisions in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. Interest and debt expense increased due to higher debt balances. The change in other income was driven by a pension settlement charge recorded during the quarter. The third quarter 2021 effective tax rate primarily reflects a lower pre-tax loss compared to the prior period, as well as benefits from R&D tax credits.  We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information presented excludes certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into the company's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following definitions are provided:  Core operating earnings is defined as GAAP earnings from operations excluding the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core operating margin is defined as core operating earnings expressed as a percentage of revenue. Core earnings per share is defined as GAAP diluted earnings per share excluding the net earnings per share impact of the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated to Commercial Airplanes and BGS businesses supporting commercial customers. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as they exclude non-service pension and post-retirement costs, which primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to government contracts. A reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided on pages 13-14.  Free cash flow is GAAP operating cash flow reduced by capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders, debt repayment, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses free cash flow as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity. Table 2 provides a reconciliation of free cash flow to GAAP operating cash flow.

"Oct 26, 2021",Aviation Industry Chief Technology Officers Issue Joint Call to Action to Deliver Sustainable Aviation Plans,", /PRNewswire/ -- Today, the Chief Technology Officers (CTOs) of seven of the world's leading aerospace manufacturers have reaffirmed their commitment to achieving more sustainable aviation and to reaching industry-wide Air Transport Action Group targets in a joint statement. This statement updates a commitment made by a unified group of CTOs in as part of a shared position to support the aviation sector's ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.  The CTOs of Airbus, Boeing, Dassault Aviation, GE Aviation, Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce, and Safran will also issue a call to action to policymakers, research institutions, suppliers, fuel producers and airport operators to build on the progress made in recent years and deliver on the aviation sector's sustainability agenda.  The joint statement comes as the CTOs come together to discuss progress in aviation sustainability at a pre event and industry showcase held in by ADS, the organisation that represents the aerospace, defence, security and space industries in the .  The CTOs of each company have committed to working together to focus on three core areas of aviation technology: • Advancing the state-of-the-art in aircraft and engine design and technology • Supporting increased availability and adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and investigating hydrogen as a fuel of the future • Continuing to develop novel technologies that will eventually enable net-zero carbon aviation while maintaining the safety and quality standards of the industry.  The seven CTOs, whose firms have spent over in R&D combined over the past five years, are calling for: • A sustained and planned approach from policymakers to support the development of novel technologies and stimulate the ramp-up of SAF and green hydrogen production capacity • Collaboration between research institutions and aerospace suppliers in the development of the new technologies • Investment by airport operators in the infrastructure required to support novel aviation technologies  Since the 2019 joint commitment, actions taken by the seven companies towards achieving net-zero carbon emissions have ranged from improvements to the fleet-in-service today and technologies for the future: • Airbus announced its ambition to deliver the world's first zero-emission aircraft by 2035, unveiling three hydrogen-powered concept aircraft that highlight the company's commitment to developing this high-potential technology for commercial aviation. Airbus is also engaged in 100% SAF climate-impact projects that are a part of its overall roadmap towards certification for the entry-into-service of 100% SAF on its fleet by 2030. • Boeing committed that their commercial airplanes will be capable to fly on 100% SAF by 2030, continues to test new technologies on its ecoDemonstrator program and announced a partnership with SkyNRG and SkyNRG Americas to scale up SAF. Boeing and also formed Wisk, a joint venture to advance the future of urban air mobility with more than 1,500 test flights of its self-flying, all-electric air taxi. Boeing completed a fifth hydrogen flight test program; this time with subsidiary Insitu on their ScanEagle3 unmanned aerial vehicle which was powered by a proton exchange membrane (PEM) hydrogen fuel cell. • Dassault Aviation actively promotes the use of SAF and its Falcon range is already SAF-compatible. Within Clean Sky 2 at the European level and civil aviation research council (Corac), Dassault Aviation's work focuses on lowering fuel consumption by reducing aircraft drag and weight. With the European Sesar program, Dassault Aviation works to improve flight efficiency and fuel consumption through the use of specially-tailored flight paths. Dassault Aviation is also involved in Corac projects related to the use of hydrogen in future aircraft. • GE Aviation is maturing a megawatt-class integrated hybrid electric powertrain to demonstrate flight readiness for single-aisle aircraft with NASA, and is leading industry efforts to define standards for 100% SAF. • GE and Safran jointly launched the CFM RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines) program in to demonstrate and mature disruptive technologies including open fan and hybrid electric targeting more than 20% lower fuel consumption and CO2 emissions compared to today's most efficient engines. Program goals include ensuring 100% compatibility with SAF and hydrogen. • Pratt & Whitney announced a major new investment towards developing a hybrid-electric flight demonstrator, in partnership with De Havilland Canada, Collins Aerospace, and the Canadian government, targeting a 30% improvement in fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions compared to current regional turboprop aircraft. Pratt & Whitney is also developing technologies for a more efficient engine core and recently opened a new engineering and development facility in , dedicated to ceramic matrix composites (CMC) to support this effort. It is continuing to validate engines operating with up to 100% SAF. • Rolls-Royce has joined the UN Race to Zero and has pledged to prove all its Trent engines – accounting for 40% of the world's long-haul fleet – are compatible with 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2023, aligned with the UN Race to Zero breakthrough on SAF take-up by 2030. It has tied its SAF compatibility goals to executive remuneration and has tested two widebody and one business jet engine types on 100% SAF; and signed an MoU with Shell agreeing to develop and accelerate the use of SAF. It has developed and flown what it expects to be the world's fastest all-electric aircraft and signed agreements in the all-electric and UAM markets with customers to power products due to fly by the middle of this decade. • Safran has created a strategic partnership with TotalEnergies to accelerate the reduction of CO2 emissions of the aviation industry by jointly working for the development and deployment of SAF that could completely replace fossil kerosene in current and future engines. Safran and Airbus will leverage the skills and test facilities of their JV ArianeGroup to prepare hydrogen technologies for aviation.  In their joint statement, the CTOs note that flying today uses 80% less fuel per Revenue Passenger Kilometer (RPK) than it did fifty years ago and that aviation accounts for 2.5% of all man-made CO2 emissions, while generating 4% of global GDP and supporting 88 million jobs.

"Oct 20, 2021",Boeing Forecasts 20-year Middle East Commercial Jet and Services Market Valued at more than $1.4 Trillion,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Oct. 20, 2021 – Boeing [NYSE: BA] said today that airlines in the Middle East will require 3,000 new airplanes valued at $700 billion and aftermarket services such as maintenance and repair worth $740 billion, with the region positioned to capitalize on the recovery of regional and international travel and cargo demand. Boeing provided the estimate in its 2021 Commercial Market Outlook (CMO), a forecast of 20-year demand for commercial airplanes and services.  Middle East passenger traffic and the region’s commercial fleet are projected to more than double over the 20-year forecast period, according to the CMO. More than two-thirds of airplane deliveries to the Middle East will accommodate growth, while one-third of deliveries will replace older airplanes with more fuel-efficient models such as the 737 MAX, 787 Dreamliner and 777X.  “The Middle East region’s role as a global connecting hub continues to be important for developing markets to and from Southeast Asia, China and Africa,” said Randy Heisey, Boeing managing director of Commercial Marketing for the Middle East. “The region has been a leader in restoring confident passenger travel through multi-faceted initiatives that aid international travel recovery.”  Air freight represents an ongoing area of opportunity for Middle East airlines, with the freighter fleet projected to nearly double from 80 airplanes in 2019 to 150 by 2040. Notably, air cargo traffic flown by Middle East carriers has increased since 2020 by nearly 20%, with two of the world’s top-five cargo carriers based in the region.  The 2021 Middle East CMO also includes these projections through 2040: • To accommodate increased passenger and cargo traffic, airlines are predicted to grow their fleets to 3,530 jets. • The region will continue to see robust widebody demand, with 1,570 deliveries supporting a growing network of international routes. • The current single-aisle fleet of 660 airplanes is forecast to nearly triple to 1,750 jets. • Boeing’s 2021 Pilot and Technician Outlook forecasts that the region is estimated to require 223,000 new aviation personnel by 2040, including 54,000 pilots, 51,000 technicians and 91,000 cabin crew members.

"Oct 18, 2021",Indian Navy Expands Maritime Reconnaissance Capabilities with Delivery of 11th P-8I,"NEW DELHI, Oct. 18, 2021 – Boeing [NYSE:BA] is continuing to expand the Indian Navy’s long-range maritime reconnaissance anti-submarine warfare capabilities with the delivery of the country’s 11th P-8I. The patrol aircraft is an integral part of the Indian Navy’s fleet and has surpassed 30,000 flight hours since it was inducted in 2013.  This is the third aircraft to be delivered under an option contract for four additional aircraft that the Indian Ministry of Defence awarded in 2016. The Indian Navy was the first international customer for the P-8 and today operates the largest non-U.S. fleet. The P-8 is also operated by the U.S. Navy, the Royal Australian Air Force and the United Kingdom’s Royal Air Force.  In addition to unmatched maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare capabilities, the P-8I has been deployed to assist during disaster relief and humanitarian missions.  Boeing supports India’s growing P-8I fleet by providing training of Indian Navy flight crews, spare parts, ground support equipment and field-service representative support. Boeing’s integrated logistics support has enabled a high state of fleet readiness at the lowest possible cost.  Boeing is completing construction on the Training Support & Data Handling (TSDH) Centre at INS Rajali, Arakkonam, in Tamil Nadu, and a secondary center at the Naval Institute of Aeronautical Technology, Kochi, as part of a training-and-support package contract signed in 2019. The indigenous, ground-based training will allow the Indian Navy crew to increase mission proficiency in a shorter time, while reducing the on-aircraft training time resulting in increased aircraft availability for mission tasking.  As a leading global aerospace company, Boeing develops, manufactures and services commercial airplanes, defense products and space systems for customers in more than 150 countries. Boeing’s advanced aircraft and services play an important role in mission-readiness for the Indian Air Force and Indian Navy.
