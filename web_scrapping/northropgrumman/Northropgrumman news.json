The showcase, presented by Northrop Grumman, in collaboration with Bondi Partners, provides small and medium-sized Australian companies an opportunity to pitch their innovations in advanced autonomous technology, payload development and digital enterprise solutions to win an opportunity to enter a 12-month mentorship program with Northrop Grumman. This year\u2019s showcase winners are Vai Photonics, Fortifyedge and Nominal Systems.  \u201cThe showcase is an excellent platform for Australian SMEs to demonstrate the advanced technologies this nation is capable of developing and exporting globally, as well as delivering to our Australian Defence Force and its allies,\u201d said Christine Zeitz, general manager, Northrop Grumman Asia Pacific. \u201cNorthrop Grumman Australia is proudly committed to building and supporting Australian businesses to boost Australia\u2019s sovereign defence industry capability.\u201d  The winners of the showcase create a range of technologies that have been developed in Australia and will be part of building the next generation of Australian Defence systems.  Vai Photonics developed a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor that measures vehicle velocity and combines that data with navigational systems to enable accurate navigation in environments where the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is not available or accessible.  Fortifyedge developed a software platform powered by tiny machine learning (small data size machine learning programs) that can manage next-generation wearables and smart devices war fighters will use in action. Users will be able to verify their identity and unlock secure devices without removing protective equipment, such as gloves and goggles.  Nominal Systems created a digital engineering platform that allows users to build complex simulations of their systems that can streamline design, testing, and operation processes. This platform provides a new dimension of mission support for space operations by enabling stress testing (through simulations) and intelligence\/data integration into modern space systems.  Through the showcase mentoring program, Northrop Grumman and Bondi Partners will now offer these innovative companies mentorship and guidance on working within the Australian and U.S. Defence industries, commercialization opportunities, engagement with government, and strategic communications, among other topics. The mentorship programs are tailored to individual company needs.  Northrop Grumman is a technology company, focused on global security and human discovery.

Dennis Monagle, U.S. Navy. \u201cWhile Fire Scout will still be active on remaining littoral combat ships, the system is being built into the Constellation-class frigate design, most notably the USS Constellation (FFG-62), as well as other ship classes.\u201d  MQ-8C Fire Scout continues to deploy on littoral combat ships with future deployments planned on Constellation-class guided-missile frigates and operations from shore sites under the Expeditionary Advance Base Operations concept, including potential logistics cargo role. Other potential future roles for the MQ-8C include mine countermeasures and anti-submarine warfare.  \u201cThe MQ-8C Fire Scout\u2019s initial deployment was aboard USS Milwaukee (LCS-5) in the Caribbean Sea,\u201d said Lance Eischeid, director, Fire Scout program, Northrop Grumman. \u201cMQ-8C Fire Scout provided increased maritime intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and targeting (ISR&T) capability that contributed greatly to the success of the U.S. Navy\u2019s counter-narcotics operations.\u201d  In addition to providing critical decision-making, MQ-8C Fire Scout is supporting advanced capabilities including demonstrating manned-unmanned teaming (MUMT), enabling sensor information sharing across a distributed force, further increasing survivability, reducing risk to and burden on manned aircraft, and enhancing weapons capacity. Fire Scout is furthering the successful integration of unmanned platforms and manned assets at sea.  With Fire Scout\u2019s ability to operate at extended ranges required for future warfighting activities, the autonomous helicopter system provides responsive, reliable, and real-time surveillance capabilities and operates from both air-capable ships and developed or austere landing zones.

Enabled by Northrop Grumman cryocooler technology, the system has cooled the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) to its operational cryogenic temperature, a critical step toward first science.  \u201cReaching MIRI\u2019s operational temperature is a major step toward science and all the astounding discoveries Webb will uncover for years to come,\u201d said Charlie Atkinson, chief engineer, James Webb Space Telescope, Northrop Grumman. \u201cThe success of this remarkable milestone is a testament to the dedication of engineers and scientists and the many years of practice.\u201d  Webb\u2019s cryocooler is an advanced machine that operates as an internal refrigerator to establish and maintain the right cryogenic temperature for the MIRI. The cryocooler keeps sensors extremely cold so the MIRI can observe the skies and capture light from billions of years ago. To date, Northrop Grumman has delivered over 50 space flight cryocoolers with an accumulated 300 years of combined on-orbit operations.  Webb\u2019s suite of scientific instruments, MIRI included, spent the last three months passively cooling off in deep space to 90 kelvin \u2013 minus 298 Fahrenheit or minus 183 Celsius \u2013 with the help of Webb\u2019s giant sunshield . The size of a tennis court, the sunshield protects the telescope from light and heat emitted from the sun, Earth and moon, and the observatory itself. Last week, Webb\u2019s MIRI reached its operating cryogenic temperature of below seven kelvin, which is minus 448 Fahrenheit or minus 266 Celsius.  Taking Webb from the drawing board and making it a reality was an enormous collaborative effort between NASA, international partners, and industry. As the largest, most complex and powerful space telescope ever built, Webb required 10 technological inventions, including revolutionary optics, detectors and MIRI\u2019s advanced cryocooler.

IBCS established a track from the JTAGS data before ground-based sensors were able to detect the target, thus providing increased situational awareness for the operators.  During the second flight test, IBCS demonstrated the resilience of the system to defeat two cruise missile targets in a stressing electronic attack environment. IBCS was able to maintain continuous track custody of the targets by fusing data from multiple sensors degraded by electronic attack.  The testing took place at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, utilizing operationally realistic scenarios with soldiers of the U.S. Army 3rd Battalion, 43rd Air Defense Artillery (ADA) Regiment at the controls of the system. These tests are part of the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) of IBCS, in which the system is evaluated on its operational performance prior to deployment and full-rate production.  IBCS has an open, modular and scalable architecture that is foundational to integrating all available assets in the battlespace, regardless of source, service or domain. Its architecture enables the efficient and affordable integration of current and future systems. Through numerous successful tests and demonstrations, IBCS has validated the ability to connect and fuse multi-service sensor data to multi-service weapons demonstrating JADC2 capabilities.

In two recent U.S. Air Force demonstrations, Northrop Grumman partnered with Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:KTOS) to showcase how its Software Programmable Open Mission System Compliant (SPOC) solution can successfully operate simultaneous waveforms with an Open Mission Systems (OMS) interface\u2014an industry first. These demonstrations validated that Kratos and other third-party industry providers can leverage Northrop Grumman\u2019s open software development kit to drastically reduce integration timelines and incorporate new capabilities that will help enable JADC2. The SPOC radio terminal also demonstrated on-the-fly reprogramming capability by replacing one waveform with another, and demonstrated common and stealth communications functions in a live over-the-air test.  \u201cThis technology can significantly enhance warfighter situational awareness, speed up data-to-decision timelines and enable rapid technology insertion from third-party providers,\u201d said Jenna Paukstis, vice president, communications solutions, Northrop Grumman. \u201cOur SPOC solution will create an affordable path to curate functions needed for JADC2 operations, and provides a new offering that will allow the DOD to easily and securely share information across military branches.\u201d  Northrop Grumman\u2019s SPOC solution provides the Air Force with an open architecture, advanced connectivity capability that is designed to address near-term JADC2 mission needs. The company\u2019s SPOC solution provides simultaneous access to four radio frequency waveforms to help interconnect the joint force in JADC2 environments.  Kratos provided their industry standard BE-CDL waveforms and software-programmable tactical radios for the demonstrations. BE-CDL integration with the SPOC solution was straightforward, as was the successful demonstration of CDL interoperability between SPOC and the USG qualified Kratos\u2019 MissionWave120 tactical radios.  \u201cKratos\u2019 tactical waveforms enable the interoperability vision of JADC2 while increasing operational flexibility through software programmability. The need to rapidly develop and deploy software-defined solutions across domains in relevant timeframes will be key to mission success in the future,\u201d said Chris Badgett, vice president of Technology, Kratos Space. \u201cNorthrop Grumman\u2019s SPOC solution is well designed, underpinning the plug-and-play integration of open third-party waveforms such as Kratos\u2019 library of tactical waveforms.\u201d  Northrop Grumman was awarded a SPOC contract by the U.S. Air Force in January 2020. The company will move its SPOC solution to the next stage of development with a flight demonstration planned for next year.  Northrop Grumman\u2019s systems, including its SPOC capabilities, will enable data as a strategic advantage across domains.
