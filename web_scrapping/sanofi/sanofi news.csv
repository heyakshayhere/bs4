Latest results from the Phase 3 IKEMA clinical trial evaluating Sarclisa® (isatuximab) in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd) demonstrated a median progression free survival (mPFS) of 35.7 months (Hazard Ratio HR 0.58; 95% Confidence Interval CI: 25.8 to 44.0; n=179), compared to 19.2 months in patients treated with Kd alone (95% CI: 15.8 to 25.1; n=123), as evaluated by an Independent Review Committee. These results, presented at the Controversies in Multiple Myeloma World Congress, represent the longest mPFS among studies investigating a proteasome inhibitor backbone in the second-line setting for the treatment of relapsed multiple myeloma (MM). These data will also be presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology on May 19. Philippe Moreau, MDHead of the Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Nantes, France“The increase in progression free survival, observed consistently across all subgroups, when adding Sarclisa to carfilzomib and dexamethasone is remarkable in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma in a proteasome inhibitor combination. Relapse is common in multiple myeloma, creating the need for differentiated second-line treatments that provide patients a longer period of time without disease progression. This updated analysis reinforces the potential for Sarclisa to become a new standard of care for patients with relapsed multiple myeloma.” A PFS analysis following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommendations on censoring rules, as applied in the approved U.S. prescribing information, showed an mPFS of 41.7 months for Sarclisa added to Kd (Sarclisa combination therapy) compared to 20.8 months in patients treated with Kd alone (HR 0.59; 95% CI: 27.1 to Not Calculable NC). Time to next treatment for patients treated with Sarclisa combination therapy was 44.9 months (HR 0.55; 95% CI: 31.6 to NC) versus those treated with Kd alone at 25 months (95% CI: 17.9 to 31.3). Time to next treatment measured the interval from the date of randomization1 to the date of commencement of the next line of therapy, thereby allowing for measurement of the period of therapeutic benefit.2 Peter C. Adamson, MDGlobal Head of Oncology Clinical Development and Pediatric Innovation at Sanofi“To observe progression free survival of more than three years in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma when Sarclisa was added to a proteasome inhibitor backbone of therapy is unprecedented and reinforces our confidence in Sarclisa as a potential best in class anti-CD38 antibody.” The safety and tolerability of Sarclisa observed in this analysis were consistent with the safety profile of Sarclisa in other clinical trials, with no new safety signals observed. For the Sarclisa combination therapy and Kd groups, the most common adverse events were infusion related reaction (45.8%, 3.3%), diarrhea (39.5%, 32%), hypertension (37.9%, 35.2%), upper respiratory tract infection (37.3%, 27%), fatigue (31.6%, 20.5%), dyspnoea (30.5%, 22.1%), pneumonia (27.1%, 21.3%), back pain (25.4%, 21.3%), insomnia (25.4%, 24.6%), and bronchitis (24.3%, 12.3%). Treatment exposure in the Sarclisa combination therapy arm was 30 weeks longer than in the control arm. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of ≥ Grade 3 were reported in 83.6% of patients treated with Sarclisa combination therapy and in 73% of those treated with Kd alone. Serious TEAEs were higher in the Sarclisa combination therapy arm versus Kd alone (70.1% versus 59.8%). No difference was observed after exposure adjustment.” These results will be discussed with regulatory authorities at a future date.  About the IKEMA trial The randomized, multi-center, open label Phase 3 IKEMA clinical trial enrolled 302 patients with relapsed MM across 69 centers spanning 16 countries. All study participants had received one to three prior anti-myeloma therapies. During the trial, Sarclisa was administered through an intravenous infusion at a dose of 10mg/kg once weekly for four weeks, then every other week for 28-day cycles in combination with carfilzomib twice weekly at the 20/56mg/m2 dose and dexamethasone at the standard dose for the duration of treatment. The primary endpoint of IKEMA was progression free survival. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate, the rate of complete response or better, the rate of very good partial response or better, rate of minimal residual disease-negativity, overall survival and safety.3 About Sarclisa Sarclisa is a monoclonal antibody that targets a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on multiple myeloma (MM) cells. It is designed to work through multiple mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on the surface of MM cells, making it a potential target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa. Based on the Phase 3 ICARIA-MM study, Sarclisa is approved in a number of countries, including the U.S. and EU, in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed refractory MM (RRMM) who have received ≥2 prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. Based on the Phase 3 IKEMA study, Sarclisa is also approved in multiple countries in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone, including in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with RRMM who have received 1–3 prior lines of therapy and in the European Union for patients with MM who have received at least 1 prior therapy. In the U.S., the generic name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc, with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Sarclisa continues to be evaluated in multiple ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials in combination with current standard treatments across the MM treatment continuum. It is also under investigation for the treatment of other hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. The safety and efficacy of these additional uses have not been reviewed by any regulatory authority worldwide. For more information on Sarclisa clinical trials, please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov. About multiple myeloma MM is the second most common hematologic malignancy,4 with more than 130,000 new diagnoses of MM worldwide yearly.5 Despite available treatments, MM remains an incurable malignancy and is associated with significant patient burden. Since MM does not have a cure, most patients will relapse. Relapsed MM is the term for when the cancer returns after treatment or a period of remission. Refractory MM refers to when the cancer does not respond or no longer responds to therapy.

Download the PDF versionNew nirsevimab data analyses reinforce efficacy against RSV A prespecified pooled analysis of Phase 3 and Phase 2b data demonstrated an efficacy of 79.5% against medically attended lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), including hospitalizations, caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)1Nirsevimab is the first investigational immunization designed to protect all infants across the RSV season with a single doseTwo analyses are being presented at the European Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases meeting1,2  Paris, May 11, 2022. Results from a prespecified pooled analysis of the pivotal Phase 3 MELODY and Phase 2b nirsevimab trials demonstrated an efficacy (relative risk reduction versus placebo) of 79.5% (95% CI 65.9 to 87.7; P<0.0001) against medically attended LRTI, such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia, caused by RSV in infants born at term or preterm entering their first RSV season.1 In a separate pooled post-hoc analysis of the trials, blood samples taken from infants dosed with nirsevimab exhibited RSV neutralizing antibodies that were approximately 50-fold higher than baseline at Day 151 post-dose. RSV neutralizing antibody levels remained greater than 19-fold higher than placebo recipients with no known RSV infection through Day 361, suggesting protection may extend beyond Day 151.2 The safety profile across the nirsevimab and placebo groups, as reported in previous trials, remains similar.3-6 These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence suggesting that nirsevimab can protect all infants through their first RSV season with a single dose.1-7 Eric Simões, MDClinical Professor, Pediatrics-Infectious Diseases, UC Denver School of Medicine“RSV remains the most common cause of LRTI in infants and results in seasonal epidemics globally each year. These new analyses strengthen nirsevimab’s potential to protect all infants across the RSV season with a single dose, which may lead to a paradigm shift in RSV prevention.” Jean-François ToussaintGlobal Head of Research and Development Vaccines, Sanofi “These new analyses are very consistent with and confirm the strong results observed in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies that evaluated nirsevimab in diverse pediatric populations. We take pride in the progress made to develop a potential solution to address this long unmet need for all infants.” Mene PangalosExecutive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, AstraZeneca “Each year, RSV causes seasonal epidemics of LRTIs in infants. These analyses add to nirsevimab’s compelling body of evidence as the first potential single-dose preventative immunization for all infants against RSV, addressing a clear unmet need in the RSV preventative landscape.”  The data are being presented at the 40th Annual Meeting of the European Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases (ESPID) from May 9-13 in Athens, Greece. Nirsevimab is being developed by Sanofi and AstraZeneca.  About nirsevimab Nirsevimab is an investigational long-acting antibody designed to protect all infants from birth entering their first RSV season with a single dose. Due to its extended half-life technology, nirsevimab is being developed as a single dose for protection of all infants through their first RSV season.5,6,8 Nirsevimab is an immunization designed to provide direct RSV protection to all infants via an antibody to help prevent LRTI caused by RSV. Monoclonal antibodies do not require the activation of the immune system to help offer rapid and direct protection against disease.9 In March 2017, Sanofi and AstraZeneca announced an agreement to develop and commercialize nirsevimab. Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca leads all development and manufacturing activities and Sanofi will lead commercialization activities and record revenues. Under the terms of the global agreement, Sanofi made an upfront payment of €120m, has paid a development milestone of €30m and will pay up to a further €465m upon achievement of certain development and sales-related milestones. The two companies share all costs and profits. Revenue from the agreement is reported as Collaboration Revenue in the Company’s financial statements. Nirsevimab has been granted regulatory designations to facilitate expedited development by several regulatory agencies around the world. These include Breakthrough Therapy Designation by The China Center for Drug Evaluation under the National Medical Products Administration; Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the US Food and Drug Administration; access granted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) PRIority MEdicines scheme; Promising Innovative Medicine designation by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; and named “a medicine for prioritized development” under the Project for Drug Selection to Promote New Drug Development in Pediatrics by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED). The safety and efficacy of nirsevimab is currently being evaluated under an accelerated assessment procedure by the EMA. Nirsevimab has not been approved by any regulatory authority. About the pivotal nirsevimab clinical trials  The Phase 2b trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial designed to measure the efficacy of nirsevimab against medically attended LRTI through 150 days post-dose. Healthy preterm infants of 29–35 weeks’ gestation were randomized (2:1) to receive a single 50mg intramuscular injection of nirsevimab or placebo. Between November 2016 and December 2017, 1,453 infants were randomized (nirsevimab, n=969; placebo, n=484) at the RSV season start. Research was conducted in both hemispheres, at 164 sites in 23 countries.6 Data was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in July 2020. The dosing regimen was optimized based on further exploration of this data. The subsquent Phase 3 study MELODY applied the optimized dosing regimen.1,5 The Phase 3 MELODY trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted across 21 countries designed to determine efficacy of nirsevimab against medically attended LRTI due to RSV confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing through 150 days after dosing, versus placebo, in healthy late preterm and term infants (35 weeks gestational age or greater) entering their first RSV season.5 Infants were randomized (2:1) to receive a single 50mg (in infants weighing <5kg) or 100mg (in infants weighing ≥5kg) intramuscular injection of nirsevimab or placebo. Between July 2019 and March 2020, 1,490 infants were randomized to either nirsevimab or placebo at the RSV season start.3 Data was published on the primary analysis in NEJM in March 2022.  The prespecified pooled analyses of the Phase 3 and the Phase 2b trials looked at infants receiving the optimized dosing regimen (infants <5 kg at dosing and receiving the 50 mg dose from Phase 2b and the infants from Phase 3), and demonstrated an efficacy of 79.5% (95% CI 65.9 to 87.7, P<0.0001) against medically attended LRTI and 77.3% (95% CI 50.3, 89.7, P<0.001) against RSV LRTI hospitalizations. The analysis was based on 2,350 infants of which 1,564 infants were randomized to receive nirsevimab and 786 infants were randomized to receive placebo.1 The results of MELODY, Phase 2/3 MEDLEY and the Phase 2b trials demonstrate that nirsevimab provides protection against RSV in all infants entering their first RSV season with a single dose.1-5 This all-infant population includes preterm, healthy late preterm and term infants, as well as infants with specific conditions. These trials form the basis of regulatory submissions that began in 2022. About RSV RSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), including bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants.10 It is also a leading cause of hospitalization in all infants, with most hospitalizations for RSV occurring in healthy infants born at term.11-14 Globally, in 2015, there were approximately 30 million cases of acute lower respiratory infections leading to more than three million hospitalizations, and it was estimated that there were 60,000 in-hospital deaths of children younger than five years.15,16 In recent months, there has been a resurgence of RSV following the easing of COVID-19 public health measures.17,18 Globally, in 2017, RSV-related direct medical costs—including hospital, outpatient and follow-up care—were estimated at €4.82 billion.19 About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company, driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

Download the PDF version  Foundation S: Sanofi’s new philanthropic spearhead Paris, May 4, 2022. Sanofi today launches Foundation S – The Sanofi Collective, its philanthropic endowment fund aiming to create healthier futures for generations. Using donations, partnerships and collective action, Foundation S will focus on three critical areas: childhood cancer, the health of communities most vulnerable to the effects of climate change and pollution, and access to lifesaving medicines and vaccines. Serge WeinbergChairman of the Board of Directors, Sanofi and President, Foundation S“As a global healthcare company, we must take part in tackling some of the challenges our society faces. We are proud of what the Sanofi Espoir Foundation has achieved this past decade and the legacy it leaves. The world changes at an incredible pace and numerous new systemic challenges emerge. Now is the right time to go one step further and Foundation S is the right structure, more focused, more agile, to better help vulnerable populations across the world. ” Foundation S will incorporate as its cornerstone initiative the former Sanofi Espoir Foundation’s ‘My Child Matters’ program in childhood cancer. Launched in 2005 to give every child an equal chance of survival, ‘My Child Matters’ provides financial support and expertise so that all children can access diagnosis and treatment. The program has helped more than 120,000 children, trained over 50,000 healthcare professionals and been credited with increasing survival outcomes. Additionally, Foundation S will fund awareness and research for childhood cancer in various countries. Together, these initiatives support the World Health Organization (WHO) objective of achieving at least 60% survival for all children with cancer by 2030, saving an additional 1 million lives over the next decade. Fighting for healthier futures requires addressing today’s challenges and anticipating growing crises. To that end, Foundation S will work to increase the health resilience of vulnerable populations most impacted by climate change and pollution. Foundation S will begin by collaborating with the international NGO Friendship, Bangladesh-based, focused on that nation’s hard-to-reach, climate-vulnerable islands of Gaibandha. There, Foundation S will help train healthcare workers, and fund satellite clinics and a floating hospital in a region outside mainstream healthcare services.  To better help vulnerable populations, Foundation S will leverage Sanofi’s longstanding emergency aid expertise and improve the connection between humanitarian and development financing. As in Ukraine, where the company has coordinated and accelerated donations of essential medicines and vaccines for patients and refugees, Foundation S will renew Sanofi’s emergency aid donations program and expand proactive support notably for displaced populations.  Paul HudsonChief Executive Officer, Sanofi and Board Member, Foundation S“The launch of Foundation S is a new cornerstone of Sanofi’s commitment to society and a pivotal moment for the life of our company and our people. With Foundation S, we aim to weigh in and act on targeted areas where we know we can make a real difference for populations exposed to health difficulties.” Foundation S will operate as a “think & do tank.” The ‘think-tank’ guides the development and implementation of Foundation S’s focus areas, convenes thought-provoking discussions on how to best address health challenges. The ‘do-tank’ is the operational arm that supports program implementation and monitors their impact on public health. Sanofi employees will be key to the success of the Foundation S and be empowered to support its programs and partners through volunteering and preceptorships: a period of practical experience to be gained.  Vanina Laurent-Ledru to head Foundation S – The Sanofi CollectiveVanina Laurent-Ledru will lead Foundation S. She was previously Head of Global Public Affairs for Sanofi Specialty Care. Before joining Sanofi, Laurent-Ledru worked on public health matters at the global vaccine alliance Gavi, and at other health companies. Vanina Laurent-LedruHead of Foundation S“We cannot change the world on our own – intelligence of the heart can only be collective. The launch of Foundation S is the culmination of joint ideas and forces. Collaborating with diverse and multicultural partners and our people, the Sanofi Collective combines our energy and expertise to deepen our impact for communities in need.” This endowment fund allows Foundation S to open the opportunity for co-sponsorship of public initiatives and broader partnerships. Through its direct product donation programs and humanitarian efforts, and by working with partners and organizations around the world, Foundation S further strengthens Sanofi’s longstanding commitment to society.

Applying average April 2022 exchange rates, the positive currency impact on 2022 business EPS is estimated to be between +4% to +5% Sanofi Chief Executive Officer, Paul Hudson, commented: “We are off to a strong start to 2022 propelled by the continued outstanding performance of Dupixent®, double-digit growth of our CHC business and improved margins in the first quarter. In R&D, we increased our investments to fuel our rapidly advancing pipeline which was further enhanced through BD collaborations such as Seagen, IGM, Exscientia and Blackstone during the period. As highlighted at our investor event in March, we remain focused on our path to industry leadership in Immunology with a broad set of novel treatments in development, including additional indications for Dupixent® in diseases such as Prurigo Nodularis and Eosinophilic Esophagitis which were recently submitted for regulatory approval. In addition, we are particularly excited about the positive pivotal trial readout for efanesoctogog alfa, our potentially revolutionizing treatment for Hemophilia A patients, with its filing planned for mid-year. Also in the quarter, we continued to execute well against our strategic priorities with our decision for the proposed EUROAPI shares listing and spin-off through an extraordinary dividend. Based on the strong first quarter, we are on track to deliver on our 2022 financial guidance, despite the challenging business environment.“         Q1 2022  Change  Change at CER    IFRS net sales reported      €9,674m    +12.6%  +8.6%    IFRS net income reported      €2,009m    +28.3%  _    IFRS EPS reported      €1.61    +28.8%  _    Free cash flow(3)    €1,707m    -11.3%  _    Business operating income      €3,065m    +16.2%  +12.2%    Business net income(1)    €2,424m    +20.2%  +16.0%    Business EPS(1)    €1.94    +20.5%  +16.1%  Changes in net sales are expressed at constant exchange rates (CER) unless otherwise indicated (definition in Appendix 7) (1) In order to facilitate an understanding of operational performance, Sanofi comments on the business net income statement. Business net income is a non-GAAP financial measure (definition in Appendix 7). The consolidated income statement for Q1 2022 is provided in Appendix 3 and a reconciliation of reported IFRS net income to business net income is set forth in Appendix 4; (2) 2021 business EPS was €6.56; (3) Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure (definition in Appendix 7).  2022 first-quarter Sanofi sales ----------------------------Unless otherwise indicated, all percentage changes in sales in this press release are stated at CER1 ---------------------------- In the first quarter of 2022, Sanofi sales were €9,674 million, up 12.6% on a reported basis. Exchange rate movements had a positive effect of 4.0 percentage points, mainly due to the U.S. dollar. At CER, company sales were up 8.6%. Global Business Units First-quarter 2022 net sales by Global Business Unit (variation at CER; € million; % of total sales)  First-quarter 2022 net sales by geographic region (variation at CER; € million; % of total sales)  First-quarter 2022 operating income First-quarter business operating income (BOI) increased 16.2% to €3,065 million. At CER, BOI increased 12.2%. The ratio of BOI to net sales increased 1.0 percentage point to 31.7% (31.7% at CER).  Pharmaceuticals First-quarter 2022 Pharmaceutical sales increased 7.5% to €7,326 million, mainly driven by the Specialty Care portfolio (up 17.8%) with continued strong performance of Dupixent® while sales in General Medicines decreased 0.7%. Specialty Care Dupixent  Net sales (€ million)  Q1 2022  Change at CER  Total Dupixent®               1,614    +45.7%  In the first quarter, Dupixent® (collaboration with Regeneron) sales increased 45.7% to €1,614 million. In the U.S., Dupixent® sales of €1,176 million (up 38.1%) were driven by continued strong demand in AD in adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 to 11 years, and continued uptake in asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). Dupixent® total prescriptions (TRx) increased 43% (year-over-year) and new-to-brand prescriptions (NBRx) grew 32%. In Europe, first-quarter Dupixent® sales grew 53.3% to €211 million reflecting continued growth in AD and additional launches in younger population in AD, asthma and CRSwNP. Neurology and Immunology  Net sales (€ million)  Q1 2022  Change  at CER    Aubagio®    491    -6.6%    Lemtrada®    25        —%       Kevzara®    95         +61.4%     Total Neurology and Immunology  611       +0.3%  In the first quarter, Neurology and Immunology sales grew 0.3% to €611 million, reflecting strong Kevzara® sales which were partially offset by lower Aubagio® sales.  Aubagio® sales decreased 6.6% in the first quarter to €491 million due to lower sales in the U.S. as a result of both competitive pressure and price. Sales in Europe were stable. First-quarter Kevzara® (collaboration with Regeneron) sales increased 61.4% to €95 million due to a COVID-19 related increase in global demand for IL-6 receptor blockers and the temporary tocilizumab shortage. Rare Disease  Net sales (€ million)  Q1 2022  Change at CER    Myozyme® / Lumizyme®    235    -3.0%    Nexviazyme®    30    ns    Fabrazyme®    22    +2.4%    Cerezyme®    165    -6.7%       Aldurazyme®    69    +3.0%    Cerdelga®    67    +3.2%    Others Rare Disease      18    -14.3%  Total Rare Disease  804  +1.9%  In the first quarter, Rare Disease sales increased 1.9% to €804 million driven by the Pompe franchise, partially offset by unfavorable purchasing patterns in Rest of the World region primarily for the Gaucher and Fabrazyme franchises. Underlying patients base treated grew around 6% compared to the same quarter of last year. First-quarter sales of the Pompe franchise (Myozyme/Lumizyme® + Nexviazyme®) increased 8.9% to €265 million primarily from new patient accruals and the ramp up of Nexviazyme®. Myozyme®/Lumizyme® sales decreased 3.0% to €235 million mainly reflecting the conversion to Nexviazyme® in the U.S. Sales of Nexviazyme® (which was launched in the US in August 2021 and in Japan in November 2021) were €30 million in the first quarter (of which €26 million in the U.S.). Sales of the Gaucher franchise (Cerezyme® + Cerdelga®)  decreased 4.2% (to €232 million) in the first quarter. Over the period, Cerezyme® sales decreased 6.7% to €165 million, mainly due to unfavorable buying patterns resulting in lower sales in the Rest of the World region. In parallel, Cerdelga® sales were up 3.2% driven by switches and new patient accruals in Europe and the U.S. First-quarter Fabrazyme® sales increased 2.4% to €220 million driven mainly by Europe and the U.S. In the Rest of the World region, despite unfavorable purchasing patterns, Fabrazyme® sales were stable. Oncology   Net sales (€ million)  Q1 2022  Change at CER    Jevtana®    98    -25.4%    Sarclisa®    65          +85.3%    Fasturtec®    40          +8.6%    Libtayo®      41            +53.8%     Total Oncology        244         +6.8%  First-quarter 2022 sales of Oncology increased 6.8% (to €244 million) driven by the Sarclisa® launch which more than offset the impact of Jevtana® generic competition in Europe. First-quarter Jevtana® sales decreased 25.4% to €98 million following the entry of generic competition in some European markets (down 75.6%) at the end of March 2021. In the U.S., sales were up 8.6%, where Jevtana® is currently covered by four Orange Book listed patents US 7,241,907, US 8,927,592, US 10,583,110 and US 10,716,777. Sanofi filed patent infringement suits under Hatch-Waxman against generic filers asserting the ‘110 patent, the ‘777 patent and the '592 patent in the US District Court for the District of Delaware. Sanofi has reached settlement agreements with some of the defendants and the suit against the remaining defendants is ongoing. A 3-day trial against Apotex and Sandoz has been scheduled starting January 2023 and the remaining defendants have agreed not to launch any generic cabazitaxel product until the earlier of a district court decision in favor of the defendants or four months after the completion of the post-trial briefing. Jevtana® also received a regulatory data exclusivity related to the CARD clinical study which expires in December 2023. First-quarter Sarclisa® sales were €65 million (versus €34 million in the first quarter of 2021) primarily driven by performance in the U.S. (€25 million), Europe (€22 million) and Japan. Rare Blood Disorders   Net sales (€ million)  Q1 2022  Change at CER    Eloctate®    138    -3.0%    Alprolix®    108          +2.0%    Cablivi®    46            +15.8%  Total Rare Blood Disorders  293        +1.8%  In the first quarter, Rare Blood Disorders franchise sales increased 1.8% (€293 million), reflecting Cablivi® and Alprolix® growth partially offset by lower Eloctate®/Alprolix® industrial sales to Sobi (recorded in the Rest of the World region).  Eloctate® sales were €138 million in the first quarter, down 3.0% reflecting lower sales in the U.S. (down 1.9%) and in the Rest of the World region.  First-quarter Alprolix® sales were up 2.0% to €108 million driven by the U.S. sales (up 8.9%), partially offset by lower sales in the Rest of the World region.  Cablivi® sales increased by 15.8% to €46 million in the first quarter driven by launches in Europe (up 46.7% to €23 million). In the U.S., sales of the product were down 4.5% to €22 million, due to the COVID-19 environment impacting treatment initiations at the hospital level. General Medicines First quarter General Medicines sales decreased 0.7% to €3,760 million and were stable excluding portfolio streamlining. Core assets  Net sales (€ million)  Q1 2022  Change at CER    Lovenox®    377           -8.2%    Toujeo®         274             +6.3%       Plavix®       261         0.0%    Multaq®        87             +13.9%    Thymoglobulin®    97            +13.8%    Mozobil®    58             +5.8%    Praluent®       69            +21.4%    Soliqua®    53             +15.9%    Rezurock®    41    na    Others      277            +1.9%  Total core assets  1,594           +4.7%  In the first quarter, core assets sales increased 4.7% to €1,594 million, driven by Toujeo®, Praluent®, Multaq®, Thymoglobulin® and Rezurock® (consolidated from November 9, 2021), partially offset by lower sales of Lovenox®. Core assets sales grew across all geographies in the first quarter. First-quarter Lovenox® sales decreased 8.2% to €377 million, mainly reflecting lower sales in the Rest of the World region (down 11.9%) due to high base of comparison in the first quarter of 2021 which benefitted from strong Covid-related demand (WHO guidelines recommending the use of low molecular weight heparins in hospitalized COVID-19 patients). In addition, biosimilar competition and supply limitations affected the performance.  First-quarter Toujeo® sales increased 6.3% to €274 million due to growth in Europe and the Rest of the World region, partially offset by lower sales in the U.S. In China, the Volume Based Procurement (VBP) for insulins is expected to be implemented in May 2022. In November 2021, Sanofi participated in the VBP tender for basal insulin analogues and was among the bidding winners in the group A with Lantus®/Toujeo®. Sanofi expects that its glargine (Toujeo®/Lantus®) sales to decrease by around 30% in China in 2022, benefitting from high volumes at significantly lower prices. In China, Toujeo®/Lantus® sales were €459 million in 2021. Plavix® sales were stable in the first quarter to €261 million, higher sales in the Rest of the World region (up 1.4%) offsetting lower sales in Europe. Plavix® sales in China were down 3.4% to €123 million due to a high base of comparison in the first quarter of 2021.  Multaq® first quarter sales grew 13.9% to €87 million, reflecting strong U.S. sales growth. Sales of Rezurock®, a recently FDA-approved, first-in-class treatment for chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) for adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older who have failed at least two prior lines of systemic therapy, were consolidated as of November 9, 2021 (through the Kadmon acquisition) and generated €41 million in the first quarter. Rezurock® performance reflects the rapidly expanding pool of prescribing institutions as well as pent-up demand from cGVHD patients who have already failed multiple systemic therapies.  Praluent® first-quarter sales were €69 million, up 21.4% driven by Europe performance. In Rest of the World region, sales were up 6.7%. In China, Praluent® was included in the NDRL list at the beginning of 2022. First-quarter Soliqua® sales increased 15.9% to €53 million driven by the Rest of World region (up 54.5%) supported by new launches and Solimix results.  Non-core assets   Net sales (€ million)  Q1 2022  Change at CER    Lantus®*    671    -1.5%    Aprovel®/Avapro®    125    +17.8%    Other non-core assets      1,187    -7.4%  Total non-core assets  1,983  -4.2%  In the first quarter, non-core assets sales decreased 4.2% to €1,983 million reflecting portfolio streamlining (-1.4ppt), lower Lantus® sales as well as the impact of VBP wave 5 in China on Eloxatin® and Taxotere® sales. Lantus® sales were €671 million, down 1.5% in the first quarter, due to lower sales in Europe, reflecting biosimilar competition and continuous Toujeo® switches.  First-quarter Aprovel®/Avapro® sales were up 17.8% to €125 million, due to some supply improvement and compared with a low base in the first quarter of 2021.   Pharmaceuticals business operating income In the first quarter, business operating income (BOI) of Pharmaceuticals increased 12.6% to €2,831 million (up 8.8% at CER). The ratio of BOI to net sales increased by 0.3 percentage point to 38.6% (38.8% at CER), reflecting an improvement of the gross margin ratio. Vaccines  Net sales (€ million)  Q1 2022  Change at CER    Polio/Pertussis/Hib vaccines(incl. Hexaxim® / Hexyon®, Pentacel®, Pentaxim® and Imovax®)    613        +10.3%    Meningitis vaccines (incl. Menactra®, MenQuadfi®)        112        -16.4%    Booster vaccines (incl. Adacel ®)        109        +4.0%    Travel and endemic vaccines           98       +61.0%    Influenza vaccines(incl. Fluzone® HD/ Efluelda®, Fluzone®, Flublok®, Vaxigrip®)         66          -18.2%    Other vaccines             22          +11.1%  Total Vaccines          1,020         +6.8%  .  First-quarter Vaccines sales increased 6.8% to €1,020 million driven by double-digit growth of Polio/Pertussis/Hib vaccines sales and partial recovery of Travel vaccines.  In the first quarter, Polio/Pertussis/Hib (PPH) vaccines sales increased 10.3% to €613 million. In the Rest of the World region, PPH sales grew 23.1% driven by a strong performance of Pentaxim® in China compared to a low base last year and favorable timing of polio tender delivery. In the U.S., PPH sales were impacted by inventory fluctuation and progressive ramp up of Vaxelis® sales. As a reminder, Vaxelis® in-market sales are not consolidated and the profits are shared equally between Sanofi and Merck.  First-quarter Meningitis sales decreased 16.4% to €112 million, due to lower sales in Latin America reflecting price competition in public tenders.  Booster vaccines sales increased 4.0% in the first quarter to €109 million, driven by the Rest of the World region.  First-quarter Travel and endemic vaccines sales increased 61.0% to €98 million, reflecting a partial recovery of Travel vaccines in Europe and the U.S. as well as higher endemic vaccines sales in the Rest of the World region. Influenza vaccines sales decreased 18.2% in the first quarter, reaching €66 million due to an exceptional high demand in the first quarter of 2021. Vaccines business operating income In the first quarter, business operating income (BOI) decreased 20.2% (down 24.8% at CER) to €296 million compared to the same period of last year. This reflects higher R&D expenses related to Translate Bio and the mRNA center of excellence and the payment from Daiichi Sankyo recorded in the first quarter of 2021. BOI to net sales ratio was 29.0% (versus 40.5% in the first quarter of 2021, 27.5% excluding the payment from Daiichi Sankyo).

In Japan, first-quarter sales increased 1.6% to €433 million driven by Dupixent® and Sarclisa® which more than offset lower sales of General Medicines. In Russia, due to strong cough, cold and flu related sales, higher vaccines sales and unprecedented stockpiling at pharmacy and patient level sales increased 34.4% in the first quarter. In March, Sanofi has decided to stop any new spending not related to the supply of its essential and life-changing medicines and vaccines in Russia. This includes all advertising and promotional spending. R&D update at the end of the first quarter 2022 Regulatory update The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion recommending to extend the approval of Dupixent® (dupilumab) in the European Union to include add-on maintenance treatment for children aged 6 to 11 years with severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) who are inadequately controlled on two maintenance therapies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent® as an add-on maintenance treatment for children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. The target action date for the FDA decision on this investigational use is June 9, 2022. Dupixent® remains the only biologic medicine approved for patients 6 years of age and older in this indication.The FDA has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent® 300 mg weekly to treat adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a chronic and progressive type 2 inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and the ability to swallow.The FDA has approved Enjaymo™ (sutimlimab-jome), the first and only approved treatment to decrease the need for red blood cell transfusion due to hemolysis in adults with cold agglutinin disease (CAD). CAD is a chronic and rare blood disorder that impacts the lives of an estimated 5,000 people in the U.S. Sanofi estimates around 3,200 patients to be drug-treated per year and that Enjaymo could reach a market share of around 25% in the years to come. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) has granted marketing authorization for Xenpozyme® (olipudase alfa) for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with non-central nervous system manifestations of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD). Xenpozyme® is currently the only approved treatment for ASMD and represents Sanofi’s first therapy to be approved under the SAKIGAKE or pioneer designation, which is the Japanese government’s regulatory fast-track pathway to promote research and development of innovative new medical products addressing urgent unmet medical needs. The EMA has accepted the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for nirsevimab under an accelerated assessment procedure. Nirsevimab, the first investigational long-acting antibody designed to protect all infants against medically attended lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season, is being developed by Sanofi and AstraZeneca. The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) published detailed Phase 3 results of the MELODY trial. In this study, with healthy infants born at term or late preterm entering their first RSV season, the primary endpoint was met, reducing the incidence of medically attended LRTI, such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia, caused by RSV by 74.5% compared to placebo. The EMA has started to evaluate the application for the conditional marketing authorization of the Sanofi-GSK first-generation recombinant COVID-19 vaccine as a primary vaccine and a booster designed to boost all currently approved COVID-19 vaccine platforms. Final analysis of the VAT02 COVID-19 booster trial confirms universal ability to boost neutralizing antibodies 18- to 30-fold across vaccine platforms. The VAT08 primary series trial, with two doses of the Sanofi-GSK vaccine in seronegative populations demonstrated 100% efficacy against severe COVID-19 disease and hospitalizations, 75% efficacy against moderate or severe COVID-19 disease, and 57.9% efficacy against any symptomatic COVID-19 disease, in line with expected vaccine effectiveness in today’s environment dominated by variants of concern. When the Sanofi-GSK vaccine was used as a two-dose primary series followed by a booster dose, neutralizing antibodies increased 84- to 153-fold compared to pre-boost levels. Sanofi and Regeneron announced the voluntary withdrawal of the sBLA for Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc) as a second-line treatment for patients with advanced cervical cancer. The decision was made after the companies and the FDA were not able to align on certain post-marketing studies. Discussions with regulatory authorities outside of the U.S. are ongoing. Portfolio update Phase 3: Sanofi and Sobi announced positive topline results from the pivotal XTEND-1 study evaluating the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of efanesoctocog alfa (BIVV001), a once-weekly recombinant factor VIII therapy, in previously treated patients ≥12 years of age with severe hemophilia A. The study met both primary and secondary endpoints, showing a clinically meaningful prevention of bleeds in people with severe hemophilia A over a period of 52 weeks, with a median annualized bleeding rate (ABR) of 0 and a mean ABR of 0.71, and a superiority to prior prophylactic factor VIII replacement therapy based on intra-patient comparison. Sanofi plans to submit the data in the U.S. mid-2022. Submission in the EU will follow the availability of data from the ongoing XTEND-Kids pediatric study, expected in 2023.A second trial (PRIME) evaluating Dupixent® in adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis (PN), met its primary and key secondary endpoints, showing it significantly reduced itch and skin lesions compared to placebo at 24 weeks in this investigational setting. The data confirm the positive results that were previously reported from the Phase 3 PRIME2 trial.The LIBERTY-CPUO-CHIC study evaluating the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous Dupixent® for the treatment of adult participants with chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO) has initiated, and enrolled its first participant.The CUPID Study B evaluating Dupixent® in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), who were refractory to omalizumab, stopped due to futility based on a pre-specified interim analysis. Although positive numerical trends in reducing itch and hives were observed, the results from the interim analysis did not demonstrate statistical significance for the primary endpoints. The LIBERTY-CUPID pivotal program was initiated in 2020 with an accelerated direct-to-Phase 3 strategy. The previously reported Phase 3 trial (Study A), which evaluated a different group of patients who were biologic-naïve, met its primary and all key secondary endpoints at 24 weeks showing that adding Dupixent to standard-of-care antihistamines significantly reduced itch and hives compared to antihistamines alone. Sanofi and Regeneron remain committed to advancing Dupixent for patients with CSU uncontrolled on antihistamines, next steps are being evaluated including discussions with regulatory authorities.The clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of amcenestrant compared with tamoxifen in patients with HR+ early breast cancer who have discontinued adjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy due to treatment related toxicity (AMEERA-6), enrolled its first participant. Phase 2: Three studies assessing rilzabrutinib have initiated, and enrolled their first participants: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adults with moderate-to-severe asthma,  a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in CSU, and an open-label study in adults with Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (wAIHA).The non-randomized and open-label study assessing the clinical benefit of SAR444245 combined with other anticancer therapies for the treatment of adults with advanced or metastatic gastrointestinal cancer was initiated, and was administered to the first participant.The pivotal AMEERA-3 clinical trial evaluating amcenestrant, an investigational optimized oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), as monotherapy compared to endocrine treatment of physician’s choice in patients with locally advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer who progressed on or after hormonal therapies, did not meet its primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival as assessed by an independent central review. Phase 1: The study assessing the safety and efficacy of 4 investigational HSV 2 vaccines in adults with recurrent genital herpes caused by HSV 2 (HSV15) has been discontinued. Given the war in Ukraine and the suffering of the Ukrainian people, Sanofi has adapted its clinical trial implementation in the region. The company decided to halt any new recruitment of patients for ongoing clinical trials in Russia and Belarus, though it will continue to treat patients already enrolled. In Ukraine, Sanofi is doing everything it can to support and supply patients currently enrolled in Sanofi-sponsored clinical trials, including transferring them within Ukraine or into neighboring countries. In anticipation of potential loss of data, the company is currently activating new clinical sites and expanding patient enrollment in geographies not impacted by the war. This may lead to the planned primary completion dates of its pivotal trials in MS and COPD to shift, previously communicated submission timelines remain unchanged. Acquisitions and major collaborations Sanofi and Blackstone announced a strategic, risk-sharing collaboration under which funds managed by Blackstone Life Sciences will contribute up to €300 million to accelerate the global pivotal studies and the clinical development program for the subcutaneous formulation and delivery of the anti-CD38 antibody Sarclisa®, to treat patients with multiple myeloma (MM), expecting to begin in the second half of 2022.Sanofi announced the research collaboration and license agreement to develop up to 15 novel small molecule candidates across oncology and immunology with Exscientia, leveraging their end-to-end AI-driven platform utilizing actual patient samples. The companies have been working together since 2016 and in 2019, Sanofi in-licensed Exscientia’s novel bispecific small molecule candidate capable of targeting two distinct targets in inflammation and immunology.Sanofi announced the completion of the acquisition of Amunix Pharmaceuticals, Inc, adding a promising pipeline of T-cell engagers and cytokine therapies. The acquisition also provides access to their Pro-XTEN, XPAT, and XPAC technology to deliver next generation conditionally activated biologics. The technology platform is highly complementary to Sanofi’s existing R&D platforms and supports Sanofi’s efforts to accelerate and expand its contributions to innovative medicines for oncology patients, with approximately 20 molecules currently in development.Sanofi and Seagen announced an exclusive collaboration agreement to design, develop, and commercialize antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) for up to three cancer targets. The collaboration will utilize both Sanofi’s proprietary monoclonal antibody technology and Seagen’s proprietary ADC technology.Sanofi and IGM Biosciences announced the signing of an exclusive worldwide collaboration agreement to create, develop, manufacture, and commercialize IgM antibody agonists against three oncology targets and three immunology/inflammation targets. An update of the R&D pipeline at as of March 31, 2022, is available on Sanofi’s website: https://www.sanofi.com/en/science-and-innovation/research-and-development   Progress on implementation of the Corporate Social Responsibility strategy Sanofi continues its progress to improve access to medicines  Sustainability-linked bond tied to Sanofi’s Access commitments Sanofi is committed to integrate sustainability within its Play to Win business strategy, as well as within its investment and financing strategy. More than a year after issuing its first sustainability-linked credit revolving facilities, Sanofi successfully priced an inaugural sustainability-linked bond indexed on access to medicines. A nominal amount of EUR 650 million of notes, tied to Sanofi’s commitment to improve access to essential medicines in low- and lower-middle-income countries via its global health non-profit unit. This transaction demonstrates Sanofi’s commitment to society, to ensure access to healthcare for the world’s vulnerable people.  Access and Pricing Principles at Sanofi Sanofi has a long history of working with healthcare systems to make its treatments accessible and affordable to patients in need. Sanofi understands and shares concerns about the affordability of medicines for patients and Sanofi encourages countries to improve value in healthcare spending. However, the Company firmly believes that the pharmaceutical industry is only one of the many stakeholders in the healthcare system that can and should contribute to this goal. Given the growing concerns over rising healthcare costs, Sanofi has developed an approach to pricing that reflects its commitment to broadly expanding patient access to medicines and vaccines while maintaining sustainable investment in Research & Development. The Access & Pricing Principles it puts forth are founded on 2 pillars: Clear rationale for pricing and access at the time of launch of a new medicine or vaccineInclusion of affordability criteria into pricing considerations for new launches When the Company sets the price of a new medicine, it holds itself to a rigorous and structured process that includes consultation with external stakeholders and considers the following factors: Holistic assessment of value (clinical, social and wellbeing and economic value)Availability or anticipation of similar treatments at the time of launchAbility of market to afford new medicinesUnique factors specific to the medicine or vaccine at the time of launch Sanofi discloses more information on its global access and pricing principles on its global website and specifically on its U.S. pricing policy on the Sanofi U.S. website. Building partnerships to support Sanofi’s pediatric cancer commitment For the childhood cancer flagship program, Sanofi aims to work together with partners, across sectors, to advance knowledge in pediatric studies.  In the research field, Sanofi is now one of the partners of the Pediatric Pre-clinical Proof of Concept Platform (ITCC-P4) that aims to enable state of the art upfront preclinical testing of novel molecularly targeted compounds. Sanofi has recently engaged in a Pediatric Oncology Relevant Target collaboration led by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) to review and prioritize targets.  For the development of innovative clinical trials, Sanofi is proud to be working closely with experts at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Institut Gustave Roussy, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. All of these efforts are centered on patient needs as highlighted by Sanofi’s support to childhood cancer advocacy groups including Coalition Against Childhood Cancer (CAC2) and Imagine for Margo. ESG dashboard In 2020, as Sanofi renewed its CSR ambitions, the Company reviewed and updated its portfolio of initiatives. Numbers shown below highlight the ongoing progress in the implementation of Sanofi’s CSR strategy.  Affordable access Sanofi Global Health, a non-profit unit formed within the company in April 2021, aims to provide 30 of Sanofi's medicines across a wide range of therapeutic areas to patients in 40 of the lowest income countries. Beyond the products provided, Sanofi Global Health will also focus on integrated programs that ensure optimal care management over time for patients.  Sanofi is also committed to helping 1,000 patients living with rare diseases who have no access to treatments and will donate 100,000 vials of medicine for their treatments each year. This continues Sanofi’s 30-year commitment to patients suffering from rare diseases, such as Fabry, Gaucher or Pompe diseases, for which access to treatment is often limited.  The third initiative on access is to develop a global access plan for all new products, making them available in selected relevant markets within two years of launch.

Any material effect of COVID-19 on any of the foregoing could also adversely impact us. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise of which we are not currently aware and may exacerbate other previously identified risks. The risks and uncertainties also include the uncertainties discussed or identified in the public filings with the SEC and the AMF made by Sanofi, including those listed under “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Sanofi’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2021. Other than as required by applicable law, Sanofi does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information or statements.

Sanofi teams up with McLaren Racing to accelerate industrial excellence
Paris, April 26, 2022. Sanofi announces today that it is partnering with McLaren Racing to accelerate manufacturing efficiency and performance in support of the company’s ambition to attain world-class standards of manufacturing excellence. Following a successful pilot in 2021 with McLaren Racing, both companies have decided to extend their collaboration across multiple sites in seven countries, covering more than 100 production lines, across all technologies. Learnings from this partnership will provide insights and develop best practices for manufacturing that will then be implemented across Sanofi’s global industrial network .
Paul Hudson
Chief Executive Officer
“We are thrilled to partner with McLaren and learn from their winning spirit and culture of going over and above. I see a lot of commonalities in our shared values to stretch, with courage and determination, so we can maximize performance and operational excellence. We want to run our lines with the speed, precision and efficiency of an F1 racing team.” 
McLaren Racing experts will collaborate with Sanofi’s Industrial Affairs team to enable continued optimization of its manufacturing operations, enabling its global network to better support the supply of its broad portfolio, as well as enhancing the delivery of its R&D pipeline, with 25 new launches expected in the next five years to meet patients’ needs around the world.
With a unique data-driven approach, McLaren Racing will bring its digital and analytical expertise and skills to further elevate Sanofi’s performance by helping to better anticipate and resolve issues before they take place. Modelling simulation of production line changeovers and operations will be key areas of McLaren’s Formula 1 experience, as exemplified using advanced data analytics and expertise used to optimize the famed pit stops of F1 races.
Zak Brown
Chief Executive Officer, McLaren Racing
“We are thrilled to be partnering with Sanofi. It is important that two global companies who share values work together to maximise performance. We look forward to continuing to collaborate with Sanofi to make a positive impact not only in manufacturing but to help Sanofi improve patients' lives.”
Beyond the technical leadership from F1, the collaboration will bring a specific focus on the people dimension of high performance. The partnership will bring a race-like mindset, emulating the competitive, fast paced environment of F1 racing to help accelerate improvements, learnings and sharing of best practices individually and collectively across sites, fostering a “one Sanofi spirit.” This unique opportunity will marry the best of the two companies with the speed, agility, teamwork, and constant improvement required to succeed in motor racing, as well as in healthcare discoveries.
Brendan O’Callaghan
Executive Vice President for Industrial Affairs, Sanofi
“We aspire to industry-leading capability across our global network of sites, so we can deliver on our mission to translate the miracles of science - discovered in our laboratories - into reality for patients. This program represents a great opportunity to improve our manufacturing sites' performance with a leading partner like McLaren, who personifies high performance in a fast-paced, ultra-competitive environment, leveraging advanced data driven  analytics and precision engineering to gain a winning edge. Accelerating our performance in this way will help us further expand the reach of our medicines to even more patients around the world.”

Download the PDF versionRezurock® (belumosudil) patient-reported outcomes correlated with clinical response in chronic graft-versus-host disease  Results demonstrate strong, but not universal, correlation between organ clinical responses and clinically meaningful improvements in patient-reported outcomes from a pooled analysis of ROCKstar and KD025-208 clinical trials Paris, April 21, 2022. Results from a pooled analysis of Rezurock® (belumosudil) for the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) show certain organ clinical responses correlated with clinically meaningful changes in patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Kadmon, a Sanofi Company, will present the results at the 2022 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) and the Center for International Blood & Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) Tandem Meetings in Salt Lake City, Utah. Jonathan Ieyoub Head of Sanofi US Rezurock Medical“These Rezurock data reinforce the importance of patient-reported outcome measures by showing their correlation to clinical response. Knowing the impact that chronic graft-versus-host disease has on patients, the results add support for use of patient-reported outcomes to assess responses in clinical care.” The pooled analysis of the ROCKstar (KD025-213) and KD025-208 studies demonstrates a very strong, but not universal, correlation between organ clinical response measures and clinically meaningful changes in PROs in patients treated with Rezurock. In particular, the clinically meaningful changes in PROs were reported in the skin, mouth, eye, upper GI, lung (clinical lung scale score), and overall measures. These data support use of PROs for response assessment in cGVHD clinical trials and patient care to help capture the patient’s perspective on cGVHD disease activity. About the Pooled Analysis The pooled analysis of clinical and PRO data included 170 (91.3%) patients enrolled in two Rezurock studies (n=132, KD025-213; n=54, KD025-208) who had baseline PROs, at least one follow-up PRO, and at least one response assessment. The median age was 54.5 years, 98 (58%) were men, the median number of prior treatments was 3, 70% had severe cGVHD, and the median duration of follow-up at the time of data cut-off was 15 months (range, 0.6-44 months).  Organ responses, defined as complete responses (CR) and partial responses (PR), were 35% (48/135) in skin, 68% (84/124) in joints, 57% (56/99) in mouth, 41% (52/128) in eyes, 73% (19/26) in upper GI, 87% (13/15) in lower GI, 23% (14/61) in lungs, and 77% (130/170) overall. For all organs except for joints, oesophagus, and lower GI there was at least one PRO that was statistically correlated at p<0.05 with National Institutes of Health (NIH) organ response. NIH clinical lung response, but not the lung response based on FEV1% change, was associated with the lung PRO.

Download the PDF versionPositive Phase 1/2 study results of rilzabrutinib in people with immune thrombocytopenia published in The New England Journal of Medicine Results published today in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that treatment with rilzabrutinib resulted in a rapid and durable increase in platelet count in patients with heavily pretreated immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)Data support an acceptable safety profileRilzabrutinib is an investigational oral Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) for the treatment of ITP, a rare acquired autoimmune disorder in which platelets are destroyed or damaged and for which there are limited treatment options  PARIS – April 14, 2022 - Positive results from the Phase 1/2 dose-finding study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics and clinical activity of rilzabrutinib, an investigational oral Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, in adults with heavily pre-treated immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Results demonstrate treatment with rilzabrutinib led to a rapid and durable increase in platelet count and support an acceptable safety profile. Sanofi is investigating the safety and efficacy of twice daily rilzabrutinib (400 mg) for adults and adolescents with chronic ITP in the ongoing Phase 3 clinical study LUNA 3, initiated in April 2021. David Kuter, M.D.Director of clinical hematology at Massachusetts General Hospital and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, lead author of the study “Currently, there are no standard treatment recommendations for ITP patients with multiple relapses. Despite advances in treatment options over the years, some patients remain refractory to existing therapies and durable remission remains elusive. The Bruton’s tyrosine kinase is a critical signaling molecule in the immune system that is involved in certain immune-mediated diseases, and our research suggests that targeting BTK may represent a promising approach to addressing the underlying cause of ITP.” ITP is an acquired autoimmune blood disorder characterized by low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) resulting from immune-mediated platelet destruction and impairment of platelet production. A decrease in platelet counts – whether temporary or persistent – can predispose a person to a higher risk of bleeding, hospitalization, fatigue, impaired quality of life, and even death. The incidence of ITP increases with age and is more common over the age of 60.  Dietmar Berger, M.D., Ph.D.Global Head of Clinical Development and Chief Medical Officer, Sanofi “We are pleased to share these encouraging early clinical results through this publication. These findings demonstrate a clinically meaningful response in difficult-to-treat ITP patients who received a  median of four prior ITP therapies. Moreover, the overall study population, which also included less refractory patients, showed a numerically higher response. Rilzabrutinib could become a first-in-class BTK inhibitor therapy with the potential to increase platelet counts quickly and durably for people with ITP.” Rilzabrutinib was granted Fast Track Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of ITP in November of 2020 and was previously granted orphan drug designation. Rilzabrutinib is being investigated in multiple clinical trials across a range of diseases including immunological and inflammatory diseases. Phase 1/2 Study Results The global Phase 1/2 adaptive, open-label, dose-finding study evaluated rilzabrutinib in 60 people with ITP with a median age of 50 years (range, 19-74). Patients had received a median of four different ITP therapies previously. Initial doses could be 200 mg once daily, 400 mg once daily, 300 mg twice daily (600 mg/day), or 400 mg twice daily (800 mg/day). The median platelet counts at the start of the study were 15×109/L, indicating a very low platelet count and high risk of bleeding. The primary endpoint measured the number of participants who achieved at least two consecutive platelet counts of ≥50×109/L and an overall platelet count increase of ≥20×109/L from the start of treatment without requiring rescue medication. Study results showed: Overall, 24 of 60 people enrolled in the study at any dose achieved the primary endpoint. Of the 45 people who initiated rilzabrutinib at 400 mg twice daily, 18 met the primary endpoint.Median time to first platelet count of at least 50×109/L was rapid at 11.5 days, which was maintained in patients with primary platelet response for a mean of 65% of weeks during the 24-week treatment period.52% of participants experienced at least one treatment related adverse event, all of which were grade 1 or 2; the most common adverse events were diarrhea (32%), nausea (30%), and fatigue (10%). There were no grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events or serious adverse events. Rilzabrutinib Clinical ProgramThe safety and efficacy of rilzabrutinib in ITP are being evaluated in the ongoing randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 LUNA 3 study in adults and adolescents (aged ≥12 years) with persistent/chronic ITP. In addition, phase 2 studies are ongoing to evaluate rilzabrutinib as a potential therapy for the autoimmune condition IgG4 disease and immunological diseases, including asthma, atopic dermatitis, chronic spontaneous urticaria and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. About RilzabrutinibRilzabrutinib is an oral Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor incorporating Sanofi’s TAILORED COVALENCY® technology being investigated for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases, including ITP. BTK is an intracellular signaling molecule involved in innate and adaptive immune responses related to certain immune-mediated diseases. By inhibiting BTK, rilzabrutinib has the potential to target the underlying disease pathogenesis.  Rilzabrutinib is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

Download the PDF versionDupixent® (dupilumab) approved by European Commission for children aged 6 to 11 years with severe asthma with type 2 inflammation Dupixent is the only biologic indicated in the European Union for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation, characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised fractional exhaled nitric oxide  Approval based on Phase 3 data showing Dupixent significantly reduced severe asthma attacks and also improved lung function and health-related quality of life for childrenData reinforce well-established safety profile of Dupixent  Paris and Tarrytown, N.Y. April 7, 2022. The European Commission (EC) has expanded the marketing authorization for Dupixent® (dupilumab) in the European Union. Dupixent is now also approved in children aged 6 to 11 years as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), who are inadequately controlled with medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment. Naimish Patel, M.D.Head of Global Development, Immunology and Inflammation, Sanofi “We are excited to bring the well-established safety and efficacy of Dupixent to even younger patients living with uncontrolled severe asthma in Europe. In addition to greatly reducing severe asthma attacks and improving lung function, patients in our clinical trial also reduced their oral corticosteroid use. This is particularly meaningful as these are medicines that can carry significant safety risks if used long term. This approval underscores our continued commitment to bringing Dupixent to as many patients as possible suffering from the negative effects of severe asthma with the hope of improving their quality of life.” Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. Up to 85% of children with asthma may have type 2 inflammation and are more likely to have higher disease burden. Despite treatment with current standard-of-care ICS and bronchodilators, these children may continue to experience serious symptoms such as coughing, wheezing and difficulty breathing. Severe asthma may impact children's developing airways and cause potentially life-threatening exacerbations. Children with severe asthma also may require the use of multiple courses of systemic corticosteroids that carry significant risks. Uncontrolled severe asthma can interfere with day-to-day activities, like sleeping, attending school and playing sports. Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent Phase 3 clinical program, which has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation, has established that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D.President and Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron “Today’s approval in Europe recognizes the benefits of Dupixent in helping children living with the profound effects of severe asthma, including unpredictable asthma attacks, routine disruption to daily activities and the use of systemic steroids that can impede children’s growth. Dupixent is the only treatment available that specifically blocks two key drivers of type 2 inflammation, IL-4 and IL-13, which our trials show plays a major role in childhood asthma, as well as in related conditions such as chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and the often co-morbid condition, atopic dermatitis. In clinical trials, Dupixent significantly reduced asthma attacks, helped children breathe better and improved their health-related quality of life. We also remain committed to investigating Dupixent in other conditions where type 2 inflammation may significantly impact patients’ lives, including eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria.” The EC decision is based on pivotal data from the Phase 3 VOYAGE trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent combined with standard-of-care asthma therapy in 408 children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. Two pre-specified populations with evidence of type 2 inflammation were evaluated for the primary analysis: 1) patients with baseline blood eosinophils (EOS) ≥300 cells/μl (n=259) and 2) patients with either baseline FeNO ≥20 parts per billion (ppb) or baseline blood EOS ≥150 cells/μl (n=350). Patients who added Dupixent to standard-of-care in these two groups, respectively, experienced:  Substantially reduced rates of severe asthma attacks, with a 65% and 59% average reduction over one year compared to placebo (0.24 and 0.31 events per year for Dupixent vs. 0.67 and 0.75 for placebo, respectively).Improved lung function observed as early as two weeks and sustained for up to 52 weeks, measured by percent predicted FEV1 (FEV1pp). At 12 weeks, patients taking Dupixent improved their lung function by 5.32 and 5.21 percentage points compared to placebo, respectively. Improved asthma control, with 81% and 79% of patients reporting a clinically meaningful improvement at 24 weeks, based on disease symptoms and impact compared to 64% and 69% of placebo patients, respectively.Improved health-related quality of life, with 73% and 73% of patients reporting a clinically meaningful improvement at 24 weeks, compared to 63% and 65% of placebo patients, respectively.Reduced systemic corticosteroid use by an average of 66% and 59% over one year compared to placebo (0.27 and 0.35 courses per year for Dupixent vs. 0.81 and 0.86 for placebo, respectively). The safety results from the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. The overall rates of adverse events were 83% for Dupixent and 80% for placebo. Adverse events that were more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included injection site reactions (18% Dupixent, 13% placebo), viral upper respiratory tract infections (12% Dupixent, 10% placebo) and eosinophilia (7% Dupixent, 1% placebo). Helminth infections were also more commonly observed with Dupixent in patients aged 6 to 11 years and were reported in 2% of Dupixent patients and 0% of placebo patients. About the LIBERTY ASTHMA VOYAGE Trial The Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent (100 mg or 200 mg every two weeks, based on weight tier) combined with standard-of-care asthma therapy in 408 children aged 6 to 11 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. More than 90% of children in the trial had at least one concurrent atopic medical condition such as allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis. The primary endpoint was the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations over one year, and the key secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in percentage of predicted pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (FEV1pp) at week 12. The FEV1pp seeks to evaluate a patient's change in lung function compared to their predicted lung function based on age, height, sex and ethnicity to account for children's growing lung capacity at different stages of development. Additional secondary endpoints included responder rates for asthma control as measured by a ≥0.5 improvement on the Asthma Control Questionnaire-7 Interviewer Administered (ACQ-7-IA; 7-point scale) and health-related quality of life as measured by a ≥0.5 improvement on the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire with Standardized Activities-Interviewer Administered (PAQLQ(S)-IA; 7-point scale). About Dupixent Dupixent is also approved in Europe, U.S., Japan and other countries around the world for use in certain patients with asthma, specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis as well as CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is also approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world, and more than 400,000 patients have been treated globally. Dupixent is an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In the EU for pediatric patients aged 6 to 11 years, Dupixent dosing is based on weight tier (100 mg every two weeks or 300 mg every four weeks for children ≥15 to <30 kg, 200 mg every two weeks or 300 mg every four weeks for children ≥30 to <60 kg and 200 mg every two weeks for children ≥60 kg) and is supplied as a pre-filled syringe. It is also available as a pre-filled pen for adolescents (12 to 17 years) and adults at 200 and 300 mg doses. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional. In children younger than 12 years of age, Dupixent should be administered by a caregiver if given at home. Dupilumab Development Program Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation. In addition to the currently approved indications, Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes including pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age, Phase 3), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3), eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3), bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3), prurigo nodularis (Phase 3), chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3), chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3), chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3), allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.

Download the PDF version  Sanofi launches first-in-pharma Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Board Paris, April 4, 2022. Sanofi launches today its Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) Board, the first-of-its-kind in the pharmaceutical industry to feature outside advisors. Sanofi’s DE&I Board will include three of the most influential voices in the DE&I space as Board members appointed for 3 years: organizational psychologist & best-selling author John Amaechi, award-winning social entrepreneur Caroline Casey, and DE&I pioneer and renowned thought-leader Dr. Rohini Anand.  Sanofi’s DE&I strategy was revamped in June 2021 with set objectives toward 2025, built around three key pillars: building representative leadership, creating a work environment where employees can bring their whole selves and engaging with the company’s diverse communities. The DE&I Board’s role is to ensure Sanofi’s DE&I strategy is rightly executed, to monitor progress on the company’s 2025 targets and to advise on how to accelerate the company’s impact in this space. Together with the DE&I Board, Sanofi is launching a global Employee Resource Group (ERG) framework and five global focused ERGs: Gender+, Generations+, Pride+, Ability+ and Culture and Origins+, which will allow already existing local ERGs to scale and grow. ERGs are voluntary, employee-led groups that help create a diverse and inclusive workplace. Critical in supporting their members’ professional and personal growth and in cultivating a sense of belonging, they ensure the company reflects, values and listens to its diverse employees’ communities. Paul HudsonCEO of Sanofi“We’re committed to driving diversity, equity and inclusion in Sanofi and beyond. These new initiatives will help us bring the outside in, so we can hear, listen and learn faster, and grow stronger as we continue our DE&I journey.” The DE&I Board is composed of eleven members, including seven members from Sanofi’s leadership - Paul Hudson, Chief Executive Officer, Natalie Bickford, Chief People Officer, Olivier Charmeil, Head of General Medicines, Roy Papatheodorou, General Counsel & Head of Legal, Ethics & Business Integrity, John Reed, Head of Research & Development, Thomas Triomphe, Head of Vaccines, and Raj Verma, Chief Diversity, Culture & Experience Officer. Raj Verma will chair the DE&I Board. One member will be one of the company’s five global Employee Resource Group Leads, with rotation among all global ERG Leads on an annual basis. The DE&I Board will meet 3 times per year and progress on the 2025 targets will continue to be communicated on a quarterly basis. John Amaechi “I am always excited to support organizations looking to ensure that whether for colleagues, stakeholders or consumers - they stand for fairness, equity and the preservation of human dignity. I am a scientist first and bring an understanding of what can work to performance through improving inclusion and equity in the context of a large, complex multinational company with a strong history and tradition. It’s clear there are many strong advocates within the company, and I am delighted to add my insights and expertise to those already present within Sanofi.” Dr. Rohini Anand “I am thrilled to join Sanofi’s DE&I Board as it affords me an opportunity to influence the critical need to address health care disparities globally. With my experience in leading global DE&I transformations I am motivated to support Sanofi as it seeks to foster an equitable and inclusive culture that enables breakthrough innovations because it is the desired destination for diverse talent. I am impressed by the authenticity and humility with which the leadership approaches DE&I and its willingness and openness to learn from external thought leaders.” Caroline Casey “It’s a real honour to be joining the Sanofi DE&I Board which will support the strategic evolution of Business Inclusion focusing on the complex intersectional nature of diversity, equity, and inclusion. As a supporter of removing the decisive siloed approach which has and continues to create exclusion and mistrust, I am proud to bring the voice of disability business inclusion front and centre of Sanofi’s strategy both as a person with lived experience and as the founder of The Valuable 500.” Sanofi’s DE&I Board external members John Amaechi is an organizational psychologist, best-selling author, Chartered Scientist (CSci), elected Fellow of the Royal Society for Public Health, Research Fellow at the University of East London, and Founder of APS Intelligence. A former NBA sportsman, John Amaechi serves as a mentor to many, a teacher to some, and always uses his deep psychological insight combined with real life experience to provide a touchstone for people and companies who want to thrive, achieve and align their beliefs, values and ethics.  Dr. Rohini Anand, is a strategic business leader, Board member and author. With expertise that spans executive leadership, human capital, global corporate responsibility, wellness and diversity equity and inclusion, Rohini brings a unique perspective on the critical alignment of the business culture and the triple bottom line (People, Planet, Profit) to drive exceptional performance. Most recently Rohini was Senior Vice-President Corporate Responsibility and Global Chief Diversity Officer for Sodexo.  Caroline Casey is a businesswoman and activist, founder of The Valuable 500, the world’s largest CEO collective and business move for disability inclusion. Recently appointed President of the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB), Caroline also sits on several Diversity and Inclusion Boards to include L’Oréal and Sky.

Download the PDF versionFDA accepts Dupixent® (dupilumab) for Priority Review in patients aged 12 years and older with eosinophilic esophagitis If approved, Dupixent would be the first medicine available in the U.S. indicated to treat eosinophilic esophagitisThere are approximately 160,000 patients in the U.S. living with eosinophilic esophagitis who are currently treated, of whom approximately 48,000 have failed multiple treatments Paris and Tarrytown, N.Y., April 4, 2022. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent® (dupilumab) 300 mg weekly to treat adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a chronic and progressive type 2 inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and impairs the ability to swallow. The target action date for the FDA decision on this investigational use is August 3, 2022. The sBLA is supported by data from two Phase 3 trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent 300 mg weekly in patients aged 12 years and older with EoE (Part A and Part B), and data from an active long-term extension trial. Dupixent 300 mg weekly significantly improved the signs and symptoms of EoE at 24 weeks compared to placebo, including the ability to swallow and reduction in eosinophil count in the esophagus. The safety results of these trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The most common adverse event observed with Dupixent, in Part A and Part B, was injection site reactions.  In September 2020, the U.S. FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Dupixent for the treatment of patients aged 12 years and older with EoE. Dupixent was also granted Orphan Drug designation for the potential treatment of EoE in 2017. Priority review is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. Regulatory filings around the world are also planned in 2022. The potential use of Dupixent in EoE is currently under clinical development, and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. About Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) EoE is a chronic, progressive type 2 inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. For people with EoE, swallowing the smallest amount of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. Those with EoE live with anxiety and frustration from having a constantly evolving list of foods to avoid. This disease can also cause narrowing of the esophagus and dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus may be needed, which is often painful. In severe cases, a feeding tube is the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and adequate nutrition. People with EoE may have poor quality of life and are more likely to experience depression than people without EoE. There are approximately 160,000 patients in the U.S. living with EoE who are currently treated, of whom approximately 48,000 have failed multiple treatments. About Dupixent Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). In the U.S., Dupixent is approved in patients aged 6 years and older with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis; as an add-on maintenance treatment of patients aged 6 years and older with moderate-to-severe asthma characterized by an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma; and for use with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults whose disease is not controlled. Dupixent is also approved in Europe, Japan and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world, and more than 400,000 patients have been treated globally. Dupilumab Development Program Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation. In addition to the currently approved indications, Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes, including eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3), pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age, Phase 3), chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3), prurigo nodularis (Phase 3), chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3), bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3), chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3), allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.

Download the PDF version  EUROAPI listing on Euronext Paris expected on May 6, 2022 French AMF approved EUROAPI’s listing prospectus EUROAPI first day of trading expected to occur on May 6, 2022 subject to the approval of the Distribution by the Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting to be held on May 3, 2022 Sanofi will host today a dedicated Capital Markets Day at 1:30 pm CET to present EUROAPI’s business in greater detailThe Distribution ratio will be one (1) EUROAPI share per twenty three (23) Sanofi sharesAfter the Distribution, Sanofi has confirmed its intention to hold circa 30% of the share capital and voting rights of EUROAPI, and EPIC Bpifrance, acting on behalf of the French State under the French Tech Sovereignty Convention of December 11, 2020, would hold 12% of the share capital and voting rights of EUROAPI and circa 58% of EUROAPI’s shares will be distributed via a dividend in kind. L’Oréal, Sanofi’s largest shareholder, has committed to a lock-up period of 1 year following the settlement of the Distribution, i.e., May 10, 2022 Paris, April 1, 2022. Sanofi announced today that the French Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) has approved the listing prospectus prepared by EUROAPI in connection with the intended listing of its shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris.  On March 17th, 2022, Sanofi’s Board of Directors unanimously decided to submit for approval to its shareholders the proposed distribution in kind (the “Distribution”) of EUROAPI shares, via an additional extraordinary dividend, exclusively in kind, in addition to the previously proposed €3.33 cash dividend per Sanofi share. The Distribution relates to circa 58% of the share capital and voting rights of EUROAPI. In connection with the proposed Distribution, EPIC Bpifrance has agreed to purchase 12% of EUROAPI shares1 from Sanofi, which confirmed its intention to hold circa 30% of the share capital and voting rights of the company after the Distribution.  The Distribution by Sanofi to its shareholders of EUROAPI shares in the form of an additional extraordinary dividend, exclusively in kind, is subject to the shareholders’ approval at Sanofi’s May 3, 2022 Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting. Subject to certain customary exceptions, the following lock-up periods have been agreed: 2 years for Sanofi and EPIC Bpifrance following the settlement and delivery of the EUROAPI shares to be sold to EPIC Bpifrance; and1 year for L’Oréal, Sanofi’s largest shareholder and for Karl Rotthier, CEO of the Company, following the settlement of the Distribution. Main features of the Distribution are as follows:  The Distribution ratio will be one (1) EUROAPI share per twenty three (23) Sanofi shares. No fractional EUROAPI shares will be issued. Any right to receive a fractional share will not be tradable or transferable. Consequently, when the amount of the Distribution to which a Sanofi shareholder is entitled does not correspond to a whole number of EUROAPI shares (i.e., less than twenty three (23) or a multiple of twenty three (23) Sanofi shares), the shareholder will receive the immediately lower number of EUROAPI shares, plus a cash payment for the whole of the balance arising from the price at which EUROAPI shares corresponding to fractional shares were sold. Each financial intermediary will sell the shares corresponding to the fractional shares of its entitled clients. As a result, the amount of the cash balance may vary depending on the shareholder’s financial intermediary; The technical reference price of EUROAPI shares is expected to be announced on May 5, 2022 by Euronext Paris after market close; The admission to trading of the EUROAPI shares and the ex-date (détachement) of the Distribution will occur at 9.00 am (CET) on May 6, 2022;The record date (the date on which positions are closed) for Sanofi shares to be eligible to the Distribution is scheduled on May 9, 2022;Payment of the Distribution (delivery and book-entry of the allocated EUROAPI shares) will take place on May 10, 2022. Following the Distribution and the purchase of 12% of EUROAPI shares by EPIC Bpifrance, the Sanofi group will no longer control EUROAPI, resulting in a slightly accretive impact on Sanofi 2022 business operating income (BOI) margin2. Documents related to Sanofi shareholders’ meeting will be made available on April 11, 2022 on the Sanofi dedicated web page. Investors are invited to read EUROAPI’s press release, issued concurrently and available on EUROAPI’s website announcing the AMF’s approval of its prospectus, and the listing prospectus in order to fully understand the potential risks and rewards associated with any decision to invest in EUROAPI shares.

Download the PDF version  Sanofi successfully priced an inaugural sustainability-linked bond indexed on access to medicines Paris, March 31, 2022. Sanofi successfully priced yesterday, March 30, 2022, its offering of a dual-tranche EUR 1.5 billion of notes (the “Notes”). It comprises an inaugural issue of sustainability-linked bond for a nominal amount of EUR 650 million of notes, tied to Sanofi’s commitment to improve access to essential medicines in low- and lower-middle-income countries via its global health nonprofit unit. This transaction demonstrates Sanofi’s commitment to society, to ensure access to healthcare for the world’s vulnerable people.  Jean-Baptiste de ChatillonChief Financial Officer of Sanofi“A year after pioneering sustainable finance with our sustainability-linked revolving credit facilities, we further contribute to the development of the sustainable finance market through the successful pricing of our first sustainability-linked bond” said Jean-Baptiste de Chatillon, Chief Financial Officer of Sanofi. “We continue to make progress in our environmental, social and governance activities that are an essential part of our strategy and embedded into our business.” The Notes consist of two tranches: €850 million fixed rate notes, due April 2025, bearing interest at an annual rate of 0.875%. €650 million fixed rate notes, due April 2029, bearing interest at an annual rate of 1.250%. The coupon amounts are linked to the achievement of a sustainability performance target defined as the cumulative number of patients, being at least 1.5 million patients, provided with essential medicines by the global health unit, for the treatment of non-communicable diseases in 40 of the world’s poorest countries, between 2022 and 2026. Sandrine Bouttier-StrefGlobal Head of Corporate Social Responsibility of Sanofi“Linking the cost of financing to the achievement of concrete targets in terms of access to medicines confirms our determination to put social responsibility at the center of our ambitions.” Sanofi’s expanded social impact strategy aims to build a healthier, more resilient world by ensuring access to healthcare for the world’s poorest people and bringing a much needed focus to the development of treatment for childhood cancer. Integrated into the company’s Play to Win business strategy, Sanofi’s commitment to society will continue the fight against infectious diseases such as sleeping sickness and poliomyelitis, while accelerating its goals to reduce the environmental impact of its products and its worldwide operations. Key to tackling the global challenges that face society are its people, who each have a role to play in building a diverse and inclusive workplace. To become an issuer of sustainable finance instruments, Sanofi has established a dedicated Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework, designed as a living document to enable future bond issues in a sustainability-linked format. The Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework is aligned with ICMA’s Sustainability-Linked Bond Principles (2020) and has received a Second Party Opinion from ISS ESG. The proceeds of the bond issue will be used for general corporate purposes. The transaction has been led by Morgan Stanley and Natixis CIB as Global Coordinators & Sustainability-Linked Structuring Advisors and, Barclays, MUFG and RBC Capital Markets, all as Joint Active Bookrunners.

John Reed, M.D., Ph.D.Global Head of Research and Development, Sanofi“We look forward to this collaboration with IGM Biosciences, a pioneer in a new class of antibody medicines for the treatment of cancer, immunology, and inflammatory diseases. The IGM Biosciences technology platform offers an exciting approach to developing high-avidity IgM antibodies that can efficiently bind and stimulate the activity of cell surface receptors. This unique platform has the potential to overcome historical limitations of conventional IgG antibodies when seeking agonists of some classes of receptors.” Fred SchwarzerChief Executive Officer of IGM Biosciences“Sanofi is a global leader in the development and commercialization of innovative therapies, and we welcome the addition of their extensive expertise and resources in expanding and accelerating the development of our IgM antibody platform across multiple areas of high unmet need. This partnership builds on an existing research collaboration with Sanofi and is a key step towards our goal of unlocking the full breadth of potential for this important new class of therapeutics. We are pleased to share this vision with Sanofi and look forward to working together on these six potentially first- and best-in-class programs.” Terms of the CollaborationUnder the terms of the agreement, IGM will receive a $ 150 million upfront payment. Sanofi has also expressed an interest in purchasing up to $100M of IGM non-voting common stock in a public financing. For each oncology target collaboration program, IGM will lead research and development activities, and assume related costs, through approval of the first biologics license application (BLA) for a product directed to that oncology target by the FDA or EMA in exchange for up to $940 million in development and regulatory milestones per oncology target. After receipt of the first marketing approval for a product directed to an oncology target, Sanofi will lead all subsequent development and commercialization activities for that oncology target. For each oncology target, the companies will share profits 50:50 in certain major markets, and IGM will be eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales in the rest of world.  For each immunology/inflammation target collaboration program, IGM will lead research and development activities, and assume related costs, through the completion of Phase 1 clinical trial for up to two constructs directed to each immunology/inflammation target, after which Sanofi will be responsible for all future development and related costs, in exchange for up to $1,065 million in aggregate development and regulatory and commercial milestones per immunology/inflammation target. Following the completion of Phase 1 clinical trial for each immunology/inflammation target, Sanofi will be responsible for subsequent development activities, commercialization efforts, and related costs. IGM is eligible to receive tiered high single-digit to low-teen royalties on global net sales. Closing of the collaboration is contingent on completion of review under antitrust laws, including the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in the U.S., and customary closing conditions.

Download the PDF versionSanofi continues on path to industry leadership in Immunology with Dupixent® (dupilumab) as key driver Dupixent peak sales ambition raised to more than €13 billion Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 2023 pivotal readouts provide potential for additional Dupixent sales ambition upgrade13 potential new medicines currently in the clinic to treat chronic inflammatory diseases, with 17 readouts expected by the end of 2024 Paris, March 28, 2022. Tomorrow, Sanofi will host an Immunology Investor Event with key members of the leadership team providing updates on how the company is advancing its Immunology strategy, including the ambition to more than quadruple Immunology franchise sales by the end of the decade. The focus of the event is on Dupixent® (dupilumab), a key growth driver, and Sanofi’s rapidly advancing pipeline, highlighting dermatological, respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases as priority therapeutic areas. Sanofi has raised the Dupixent sales peak ambition to more than €13 billion. This new ambition does not include potential for additional sales ambition upgrade from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with pivotal readouts anticipated in 2023. For more than a decade Sanofi, in collaboration with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN), has been advancing the science of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation. Dupixent is now a market leader and more than 400,000 patients with certain types of atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis have been treated globally. By 2025, Dupixent is expected to generate an additional 11 new regulatory submissions across indications and age groups. Bill SiboldExecutive Vice President, Head of Global Specialty Care, Sanofi“In the five years since launch, Dupixent has excelled in improving the lives of patients with diseases driven by type 2 inflammation. This truly unique medicine is only at the beginning of its journey to helping potentially millions of patients. Beyond Dupixent, we are committed to delivering the next generation of novel medicines that we hope will change the practice of medicine in chronic inflammatory diseases beyond type 2 inflammation. We are committed to moving with the utmost urgency to bring new medicines to patients that address their individual needs, offering choice and hope.” Sanofi’s novel pipeline is comprised of 13 next-generation medicines designed to target mechanisms beyond type 2 inflammation. Our Research & Development (R&D) teams are following the science to control chronic inflammation and collaborating with leading experts across all sectors to address both urgent and growing patient needs. We are focused on targets with the most potential to alter the course of immune-based diseases, from the mildest to the most severe, using novel technologies that unlock previously inaccessible biology. These drug discovery platforms, for example, synthetic biology, TAILORED COVALENCY™ chemistry, and multispecific NANOBODY® molecules, are allowing Sanofi to pursue both injectable and oral therapeutics. Sanofi’s attack in immunological diseases also entails precision medicine approaches that aim to remove the guess-work from clinical practice by treating the right patients, with the right medicines, at the right time. John Reed, M.D., Ph.D.Global Head of Research and Development, Sanofi“Our long-term strategy goes well beyond Dupixent to deliver best-in-class medicines that break efficacy ceilings and help patients with chronic inflammatory diseases achieve long-term disease modification. We are pursuing this ambition through precision medicine approaches that leverage our proprietary technologies, such as our NANOBODY platform that can help us address multiple therapeutic targets with one medicine. With approximately 21 clinical readouts expected across our promising immunology pipeline by the end of next year, it is an exciting time for our team working in Immunology R&D.” Sanofi will highlight the following assets in its growing R&D pipeline: Three candidates for AD, complementing Dupixent’s position in AD driven by type 2 inflammation, spanning all severities of disease as well as topical, oral and injectable administration. These drug development programs include our acceleration of priority asset amlitelimab, an anti-OX40L antibody that aims to restore immune homeostasis between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory T cells.Two complementary candidates for COPD, developed in collaboration with Regeneron, targeting distinct subpopulations.A broad Phase 1 clinical program of small molecules and biologics. These candidate medicines include oral small molecules, degraders, synthetic cytokines, and several NANOBODY molecules, designed to simultaneously tackle two proven targets, thus aiming to  break efficacy ceilings.

Download the PDF version  Xenpozyme® (olipudase alfa) approved in Japan, first and only approved therapy indicated to treat acid sphingomyelinase deficiency Xenpozyme represents first Sanofi therapy to be approved under the SAKIGAKE ‘fast-track’ designationApproval based on positive results from two separate clinical trials in children and adults demonstrating improvement in lung function (as measured by DLco) and reduction of spleen and liver volumes Paris, March 28, 2022. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (MHLW) has granted marketing authorization for Xenpozyme® (olipudase alfa) for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with non-central nervous system (non-CNS) manifestations of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), a rare, progressive, and potentially life-threatening genetic disease. Xenpozyme is currently the only approved treatment for ASMD and represents Sanofi’s first therapy to be approved under the SAKIGAKE (or “pioneer”) designation, which is the Japanese government’s regulatory fast-track pathway to promote research and development of innovative new medical products addressing urgent unmet medical needs.  John Reed, M.D., Ph.DExecutive Vice President, Global Head of Research and Development, Sanofi“Today’s approval of Xenpozyme is a watershed moment for ASMD patients and their families, representing 20 years of research and the shared efforts of advocacy partners, clinicians, and patients. As the world’s first medicine approved for ASMD, Xenpozyme offers a potentially transformative option for this historically neglected community. We are proud of this achievement and grateful that Japan’s PDMA has recognized the significance of the unmet need that Xenpozyme addresses with the Sakigake designation. At Sanofi, we are working with health authorities globally, including the EU where olipudase alfa has PRIME designation and in the USA where this enzyme replacement therapy has Breakthrough designation, to rush this important medicine to ASMD patients around the world.”  Xenpozyme is a recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase enzyme developed to replace deficient or defective acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), an enzyme that allows for the breakdown of the lipid sphingomyelin. Accumulation of sphingomyelin in cells can cause harm to the lungs, spleen, and liver, as well as other organs, potentially leading to early death.  The approval of Xenpozyme in Japan is based on positive results from the ASCEND and ASCEND-Peds clinical trials, showing that Xenpozyme provided improvement in lung function (as measured by diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, or DLco) and reduction of spleen and liver volumes, with a well-tolerated safety profile in adults and children with ASMD. These data were presented at the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) 2020 Virtual Meeting. Xenpozyme has been evaluated in children and adults to treat non-CNS manifestations of ASMD type A/B and ASMD type B. Xenpozyme has not been studied in patients with ASMD type A.  Historically known as Niemann-Pick disease types A, A/B, and B, ASMD is a genetically-based, progressive, and potentially life-threatening disease. ASMD represents a spectrum of disease, with two types that may represent opposite ends of a continuum referred to as ASMD type A and ASMD type B. ASMD type A/B is an intermediate form that includes varying degrees of CNS involvement. Until now, no approved therapies for ASMD have been available anywhere in the world. Outside of Japan, olipudase alfa is being evaluated by regulatory authorities around the world. A Biologics License Application (BLA) for olipudase alfa was accepted for Priority Review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with a decision expected early Q3 2022. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has awarded olipudase alfa the PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) designation, and a decision is anticipated in the second half of 2022.

Detailed positive results from the Phase 3 PRIME2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Dupixent® (dupilumab) was presented today in a late-breaking session at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) 2022 Annual Meeting. The companies previously announced topline results from PRIME2 and a second trial called PRIME investigating the use of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis. In both trials, Dupixent significantly reduced itch and skin lesions compared to placebo. In total, 21 scientific abstracts evaluating the safety and efficacy of Dupixent in patients with atopic dermatitis in different age groups, as well as investigational indications – prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria – will be presented at the congress. Gil Yosipovitch, M.D.Professor of Dermatology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, and principal investigator of the PRIME2 trial“Prurigo nodularis is a relentless and often misunderstood itchy skin disease that leaves many patients with uncontrolled symptoms such as unbearable itch and painful skin lesions, along with a significantly impaired quality of life that should not be underestimated. These positive results are the first time a Phase 3 trial has demonstrated that targeting key drivers of type 2 inflammation, IL-4 and IL-13, with dupilumab significantly improved itch and skin lesions in this highly burdensome disease.” The randomized, placebo-controlled PRIME2 trial met primary and all key secondary endpoints with data presented at AAD 2022 showing: 37% of Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline compared to 22% of placebo patients (p=0.0216) at week 12, the primary endpoint. Nearly three times as many Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at week 24: 58% of Dupixent patients compared to 20% of placebo patients (p<0.0001).Nearly three times as many Dupixent patients achieved clear or almost clear skin at week 24: 45% of Dupixent patients compared to 16% of placebo patients (p<0.0001).  The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatology indications. For the 24-week treatment period, overall rates of adverse events were generally similar between Dupixent and placebo groups (57% Dupixent, 51% placebo). Adverse events that were more commonly (>5%) observed with Dupixent were herpes viral infections (7% Dupixent, 0% placebo). A lower rate of skin infections were observed with Dupixent (5% Dupixent, 9% placebo). Additionally, 3% of Dupixent patients and 30% of placebo patients discontinued prior to week 24. Results from the confirmatory PRIME trial will be presented at an upcoming medical congress.  Data from both trials will form the basis of regulatory submissions around the world for Dupixent in prurigo nodularis, which are planned to begin in the first half of 2022. The potential use of Dupixent in prurigo nodularis is currently under clinical development, and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense, persistent itch, with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. Prurigo nodularis is often described as painful with burning, stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of uncontrolled prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and is comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health, activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long term. There are approximately 75,000 people in the U.S. who are unable to control their disease with systemic therapy and are most in need of a treatment option. About the TrialPRIME2, part of the LIBERTY-PN PRIME clinical program, is a randomized, Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 160 adults with prurigo nodularis inadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or with whom those therapies were not advisable. During the 24-week treatment period, patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks with or without topical treatments (low- or medium-dose topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors were continued if patients were using these treatments at randomization).  The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at week 12 (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale WI-NRS of 0-10). Key secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at week 24 and the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin at week 24 (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage IGA PN-S 0-4 scale).  About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). Dupixent is currently approved in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, as well as certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is also approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world and more than 400,000 patients have been treated globally. Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied in more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation. In addition to the currently approved indications, Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes, including prurigo nodularis (Phase 3), pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age, Phase 3), hand and foot atopic dermatitis (Phase 3), eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3), chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3), bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3), chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3), chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3), allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.

Download the PDF version  Sanofi moves forward with EUROAPI listing on Euronext Paris Sanofi will give its shareholders the opportunity to be part of EUROAPI’s new chapter of growth through an additional extraordinary dividend in kindEUROAPI listing on Euronext Paris will occur in H1 2022, despite volatile market conditionsThe French State, through the fund French Tech Souveraineté, intends to acquire 12% of EUROAPI’s capital for up to €150 million from Sanofi to become a long-term reference shareholder of EUROAPIAs planned, Sanofi will continue to hold circa 30% of EUROAPI, post transaction The overall transaction is subject to approval at the Sanofi 2022 Shareholders Meeting, and the AMF approval on EUROAPI’s French prospectus Paris, March 18 2022. Today marks a major milestone for EUROAPI, a leading European company dedicated to the development, production and marketing of active pharmaceutical ingredients* (API), as Sanofi’s Board of Directors unanimously proposed, on March 17th, to submit to its shareholders the distribution of circa 58% of the share capital of EUROAPI. In addition to the previously proposed €3.33 cash dividend per Sanofi share, this additional extraordinary dividend, exclusively in kind, is subject to shareholders approval at Sanofi’s May 3, 2022 Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting. If approved, the distribution will take place shortly after the listing of EUROAPI’s shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris, subject to the approval of the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) on EUROAPI’s French prospectus, which will be made available to the public ahead of Sanofi’s Shareholders’ Meeting. Through this transaction, Sanofi is giving its shareholders the opportunity to take part in the success of a leading player in the API market with strong ambitions to become a global champion on a growing and dynamic market, and due to be listed on the regulated market of Euronext Paris.  In connection with the proposed spin-off, French Tech Souveraineté has agreed to purchase 12% in EUROAPI shares from Sanofi for up to €150 million, with the acquisition price to be determined based upon the thirty day volume weighted average trading price (“VWAP”) of EUROAPI’s shares on Euronext Paris, starting on the first day of trading. As a result, French Tech Souveraineté  will become a long-term reference shareholder of EUROAPI and will be represented by two non-executive members on EUROAPI's Board of Directors, including Benjamin Paternot and another member to be determined. French Tech Souveraineté’s investment is subject to approval of the spin-off by Sanofi’s shareholders and other customary conditions. Post transaction, Sanofi confirms that it will hold circa 30% of the share capital and voting rights of EUROAPI and will remain a long-term strategic partner, supporting EUROAPI’s growth ambitions as an independent company over the coming years. In addition to its highly diversified customer base of approximately 530 customers, EUROAPI benefits from a strong and long-term customer relationship with Sanofi, which represented nearly half of EUROAPI’s revenues in 2021. In line with its “Play to Win” strategy aiming at simplifying its operations, Sanofi announced in February 2020 its ambition to create a new world leader in APIs to secure significant manufacturing and supply capacities that are critical for patients in Europe and beyond, in a context of increasing shortage of medicines essential to patient care. In 2021, Sanofi announced several critical steps in this journey with the unveiling of the creation of EUROAPI and the appointment of Karl Rotthier as its CEO in January, the appointment of Viviane Monges as Chair of the Supervisory Board in July and the finalization of the carve-out in December 2021. Despite volatile market conditions, Sanofi has decided to move forward with the listing process of EUROAPI. As an independent stand-alone company, EUROAPI will be able to fully unlock its growth potential, offering the best alignment of strategy, value creation and financial objectives for all of Sanofi’s shareholders.  With a diversified technology portfolio, EUROAPI is positioned as the world's leading manufacturer of small molecule API (including complex chemical synthesis molecules, biochemical molecules from fermentation and highly potent molecules). It was the world's second largest manufacturer of APIs (including both small and large molecules such as peptides and oligonucleotides) in 2021 and number seven in the global CDMO (Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization) market in 20201.  EUROAPI develops, manufactures, markets and distributes APIs and intermediates used in the formulation of medicines for human and veterinary use, both from originators and generics, through its API Solutions business and CDMO activities.  Drawing on more than 150 years of experience in the growing API market, EUROAPI has a network of six production sites, all of which are located in Europe, and delivers around 200 APIs to approximately 530 customers in over 80 countries. The company will be able to rely on the expertise of around 3,350 employees and expects to achieve consolidated sales of around EUR 1 billion in the year ending December 31, 2022.  Further details regarding the specifics of the distribution, including the parity, and the timetable of the spin-off will be set forth in EUROAPI’s French prospectus.  Following the AMF’s approval of EUROAPI’s French prospectus, Sanofi and EUROAPI’s management teams will host a dedicated Capital Markets Day on April 1, 2022 at 1:30 pm CET to present EUROAPI’s business in greater detail (event registration details are available here). *About Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs)Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) are the chemical or biological substances in a medicine that have a therapeutic effect.

Download the PDF versionSanofi announces €300 million collaboration with Blackstone Life Sciences to advance an innovative treatment for multiple myeloma Investment will accelerate the overall Sarclisa® development programSanofi will continue to fully manage the clinical program and retain full rights and control of Sarclisa® (isatuximab) PARIS, March 15, 2022. Sanofi and Blackstone (NYSE: BX) today announced a strategic, risk-sharing collaboration under which funds managed by Blackstone Life Sciences (BXLS) will contribute up to €300 million to accelerate the global pivotal studies and the clinical development program for the subcutaneous formulation and delivery of the anti-CD38 antibody Sarclisa®, to treat patients with multiple myeloma (MM). If successful, BXLS will be eligible to receive royalties on future subcutaneous sales. The pivotal study for the subcutaneous formulation is expected to begin in the second half of 2022. For the Sarclisa® subcutaneous formulation delivery, Sanofi has partnered with drug delivery technology innovator company Enable Injections, Inc. to advance the development of a subcutaneous delivery for Sarclisa® with the goal of offering a unique patient-centric treatment experience. To-date, Sarclisa® has received regulatory approval for intravenous administration to treat certain patients with relapsed MM and is under investigation across the MM treatment continuum of care for other hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. John Reed, MD, Ph.D.Global Head of Research and Development for Sanofi“The collaboration with Blackstone will accelerate our ability to offer patients a subcutaneous anti-CD38 antibody therapy that we believe will be innovative and more convenient. We are committed to building an industry-leading, sustainable pipeline with a steady stream of new therapies that have the potential to transform the practice of medicine”. Nicholas Galakatos, Ph.D.Global Head of Blackstone Life Sciences“We are excited to collaborate with Sanofi's experienced development team to advance a subcutaneous dosage form for Sarclisa for patients. Our investment demonstrates Blackstone’s commitment and ability to provide innovative sources of financing to the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies as we offer capital at scale and complementary expertise to help advance important medicines in critical therapeutic areas.” Sanofi has considerable expertise in oncology and has increased research and development capabilities, focusing on difficult to treat cancers, including breast, blood, and lung. Additional terms of the collaboration were not disclosed. About Sarclisa® Sarclisa® is a monoclonal antibody that targets a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on MM cells. It is designed to work through multiple mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on the surface of MM cells, making it a potential target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa®. Based on the Phase 3 ICARIA-MM study, Sarclisa® is approved in a number of countries in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed refractory MM (RRMM) who have received ≥2 prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. Based on the Phase 3 IKEMA study, Sarclisa® is also approved in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with RRMM who have received 1–3 prior lines of therapy and in the European Union for patients with MM who have received at least 1 prior therapy. In the U.S., the generic name for Sarclisa® is isatuximab-irfc, with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Sarclisa® continues to be evaluated in multiple ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials in combination with current standard treatments across the MM treatment continuum. It is also under investigation for the treatment of other hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. The safety and efficacy of these additional uses have not been reviewed by any regulatory authority worldwide. For more information on Sarclisa® clinical trials, please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov. About Multiple Myeloma  Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematologic malignancy,1 with more than 130,000 new global annual diagnoses2. Despite available treatments, MM remains an incurable malignancy and is associated with significant patient burden. Since MM does not have a cure, most patients will relapse. Relapsed MM is the term for when the cancer returns after treatment or a period of remission. Refractory MM refers to when the cancer does not respond or no longer responds to therapy.

Download the PDF versionSanofi provides update on Phase 2 study evaluating amcenestrant in ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer AMEERA-3 trial did not meet primary endpoint of improving progression-free survivalOngoing trials continue as planned, including AMEERA-5 and AMEERA-6 Paris, March 14, 2022. The Phase 2 AMEERA-3 clinical trial evaluating amcenestrant, an investigational optimized oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), did not meet its primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by an independent central review. The trial evaluated amcenestrant as monotherapy compared to endocrine treatment of physician’s choice in patients with locally advanced or metastatic estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer who progressed on or after hormonal therapies. No new safety signals were identified and the safety profile of amcenestrant in AMEERA-3 was consistent with earlier studies. John Reed, MD, PhDHead of Research and Development at Sanofi“This Phase 2 trial evaluated amcenestrant as a monotherapy in a patient population with advanced disease where limited treatment options remain. While we are disappointed with the AMEERA-3 results, we continue to investigate amcenestrant in patients with earlier stages of breast cancer with different tumor profiles and where different standard of care treatments are used.” Sanofi will continue to assess data from the AMEERA-3 trial and work with investigators on the publication of the full results. The ongoing clinical trial program for amcenestrant continues as planned, including AMEERA-5 and AMEERA-6. Amcenestrant is an optimized oral SERD that binds to the estrogen receptors (ER) in breast cancer cells to inhibit their normal function and trigger degradation so they can no longer be used by tumor cells to grow. Amcenestrant is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority. About the AMEERA-3 trial AMEERA-3 was an open-label, Phase 2 randomized trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of amcenestrant as a monotherapy compared to single-agent endocrine treatment of the physician’s choice in patients with ER+, HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with prior exposure to hormonal therapies. The primary objective of AMEERA-3 was to determine whether amcenestrant improved PFS assessed by an independent central review compared to endocrine monotherapy. The key secondary efficacy endpoint was overall survival and other secondary endpoints were objective response rate, disease control rate, clinical benefit rate and duration of response. The study also compared the overall safety profile in the two treatment arms and evaluated health-related quality of life in the two treatment arms based on patient-reported outcomes. About the amcenestrant clinical program The comprehensive development program for amcenestrant has been designed to evaluate its potential as an oral endocrine backbone therapy across treatment lines, including: as a single agent in second-line or later lines of treatment of ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer (MBC) (AMEERA-3), in combination with palbociclib in the first-line treatment of ER+/HER2- MBC (AMEERA-5), and to explore its potential in early-stage breast cancer patients in the adjuvant setting (AMEERA-6). Initiated in late 2020, the Phase 3 AMEERA-5 clinical trial is now fully enrolled. The Phase 3 AMEERA-6 trial, in partnership with the Breast International Group (BIG), the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), and the Alliance Foundation Trials (AFT) is now enrolling.

Download the PDF versionEfanesoctocog alfa met primary and key secondary endpoints in pivotal study in hemophilia A, demonstrating superiority to prior factor prophylaxis treatment Once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa met primary endpoint in phase 3 study, resulting in a clinically meaningful prevention of bleeding episodes (bleed protection) In the key secondary endpoint, efanesoctocog alfa demonstrated superiority in prevention of bleeding episodes, showing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in annualized bleeding rate compared to prior factor VIII prophylaxis therapyEfanesoctocog alfa is a novel and investigational factor VIII therapy designed to provide near-normal factor activity levels for the majority of the week in a once-weekly prophylactic treatment regimen Paris and Stockholm – March 9, 2022 -  Sanofi and Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ) (Sobi®) (STO:SOBI) today announced positive topline results from the pivotal XTEND-1 Phase 3 study evaluating the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of efanesoctocog alfa (BIVV001) in previously treated patients ≥12 years of age with severe hemophilia A. The study met the primary endpoint, showing a clinically meaningful prevention of bleeds in people with severe hemophilia A receiving weekly prophylaxis with efanesoctocog alfa over a period of 52 weeks. The median annualized bleeding rate (ABR) was 0 with a mean ABR of 0.71. The key secondary endpoint was also met, demonstrating once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa was superior to prior prophylactic factor VIII replacement therapy, showing a statistically significant reduction in ABR based on intra-patient comparison. Efanesoctocog alfa was well-tolerated, and inhibitor development to factor VIII was not detected. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>5% of participants overall) were headache, arthralgia, fall, and back pain. Dietmar Berger, MD, PhD Global Head of Development and Chief Medical Officer, Sanofi“While advances have been made in the treatment of hemophilia, unmet medical needs still exist. These positive topline data, showing a very low annualized bleeding rate, enhance efanesoctocog alfa’s potential to transform hemophilia A therapy. We believe efanesoctocog alfa  provides higher protection for longer duration with reduced treatment burden of once-weekly dosing, and we look forward to working with regulators to bring this therapy to patients as soon as possible.” Hemophilia A is a rare, genetic disorder in which the ability of a person’s blood to clot is impaired due to a lack of factor VIII. Hemophilia A occurs in about one in 5,000 male births annually, and more rarely in females. People with hemophilia can experience bleeding episodes that can cause pain, irreversible joint damage and life-threatening hemorrhages. Anders Ullman, MD, PhDHead of R&D and Chief Medical Officer, Sobi“We believe once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa has the potential to represent a new class of factor VIII therapy designed to provide high sustained factor VIII levels near normal for the majority of the week. We look forward to sharing these Phase 3 results, including data on physical health, pain and joint health, at future medical meetings.” The data will be the basis for submission to regulatory authorities around the globe beginning this year. Submission in the EU will follow availability of data from the ongoing XTEND-Kids pediatric study, expected in 2023. Efanesoctocog alfa was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August 2017 and the European Commission in June 2019. The US FDA granted Fast Track Designation in February 2021. Efanesoctocog alfa is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority. About Phase 3 XTEND-1 studyThe Phase 3 XTEND-1 study (NCT04161495) is an open-label, non-randomized interventional study assessing the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of efanesoctocog alfa in people 12 years of age or older (n=159) with severe hemophilia A who were previously treated with factor VIII replacement therapy. The study includes two parallel treatment arms – the prophylaxis arm, where study participants received a weekly prophylactic 50 IU/kg dose of efanesoctocog alfa for 52 weeks (Arm A), some of which were enrolled following an observation period on prophylaxis using currently marketed factor VIII replacement therapies, and an on-demand arm, where study participants  received 50 IU/kg as needed for 26 weeks followed by weekly prophylaxis for another 26 weeks (Arm B). The primary efficacy endpoint was the annualized bleeding rate (ABR) in Arm A, and the key secondary endpoint was an intra-patient comparison of ABR during the efanesoctocog alfa  weekly prophylaxis treatment period versus the prior prophylaxis ABR for participants in Arm A who participated in Study 242HA201/OBS16221, an observational study. About efanesoctocog alfa (BIVV001)Efanesoctocog alfa is a novel and investigational recombinant factor VIII therapy that is designed to extend protection from bleeds with once-weekly prophylactic dosing for people with hemophilia A. It builds on the innovative Fc fusion technology by adding a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN® polypeptides to extend its time in circulation. It is the first investigational factor VIII therapy that has been shown to break through the von Willebrand factor ceiling, which imposes a half-life limitation on current factor VIII therapies. Efanesoctocog alfa is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority. About the Sanofi and Sobi collaborationSobi and Sanofi collaborate on the development and commercialization of Alprolix® and Elocta®/Eloctate®. The companies also collaborate on the development and commercialization of efanesoctocog alfa, an investigational factor VIII therapy with the potential to provide high sustained factor activity levels with once-weekly dosing for people with hemophilia A. Sobi has final development and commercialization rights in the Sobi territory (essentially Europe, North Africa, Russia and most Middle Eastern markets).

Download the PDF versionSanofi recognized by S&P as one of the most sustainability-committed companies Paris, March 8, 2022. Sanofi was today recognized as one of the most sustainability-committed companies in an ESG Evaluation (Environment, Social, Governance) performed by Standard & Poor’s Global Ratings (S&P). The ESG Evaluation awarded Sanofi a score of 86 out of 100 points, one of the highest scores across all sectors globally. Sanofi’s ESG profile was awarded 80 points for its solid fundamentals, completed with an additional strong preparedness opinion of 6 points awarded for its ‘excellent awareness of risks and opportunities’ and its capacity to ‘anticipate and adapt to a variety of long-term plausible disruptions’. Sanofi's Social Profile was ranked as ‘leading’ in the category of communities highlighting the recent 2021 creation of its global health unit which aims to provide 30 of Sanofi's medicines across a wide range of therapeutic areas to patients in 40 of the lowest income countries. The report also noted Sanofi’s commitment to eliminating infectious disease such as polio, sleeping sickness and malaria.  Sanofi is the first large biopharmaceutical company evaluated by a S&P Global Ratings ESG Evaluation and was notably distinguished for its commitment to access to medicines, particularly in vulnerable communities. The study, which recognized ‘the increasing challenges and inequalities in healthcare across all geographies’, identified the creation of a nonprofit unit dedicated to provide poorest countries with access to essential medicines as ‘one of Sanofi's leading differentiators’. Sandrine Bouttier-StrefGlobal Head of Corporate Social Responsibility of Sanofi“We are pleased that S&P’s Global Ratings ranked us among the topmost sustainable companies. The results of the ESG Evaluation is true recognition for the accomplishments that our team has achieved since launching our ‘renewed commitment to society’ in 2021. We are particularly proud that our newly formed Global Health Unit, which reflects our commitment to society and vulnerable populations, has been named as a leading differentiator by S&P Global Ratings ESG evaluators.” Standard & Poor’s Global RatingsESG Evaluation“The ESG Evaluation reflects our assessment of Sanofi's innovation capacity, which we think will help drive the industry forward, as well as the concrete steps it has already taken in implementing its strategy.” Embedded into the company’s Play to Win strategy, Sanofi’s social impact strategy is based on four essential pillars in which Sanofi is uniquely positioned to make a difference: (1) global access & affordability to health while helping healthcare systems' sustainability including educational programs, (2) Innovation for the most vulnerable populations (3) Ensuring patients’ access to medicines while reconnecting health with the planet (4) Building an inclusive workplace while engaging with communities. The continuous implementation of Sanofi’s social impact strategy has led in recent months to a range of positive updates of the company’s rank or grade in most of the ESG rankings. Sanofi communicates on a quarterly basis on the progress on implementation of its social impact strategy with a dedicated section in the earnings press release. About the ESG EvaluationS&P Global Ratings' ESG Evaluation is a cross-sector, relative analysis of an entity's capacity tocontinue to operate successfully. It is grounded in how ESG factors could affect stakeholders,potentially leading to a material direct or indirect financial impact on the entity.First, an ESG profile is established for a given entity, which assesses the exposure of the entity'soperations to observable ESG risks and opportunities, and how the entity is mitigating these risks and capitalizing on these opportunities.Second, the entity's long-term preparedness is assessed, namely its capacity to anticipate andadapt to a variety of long-term plausible disruptions.

Download the PDF versionNirsevimab significantly protected infants against RSV disease in Phase 3 trial Nirsevimab showed a 74.5% reduction in lower respiratory tract infections caused by RSV requiring medical care in healthy infants1,2Nirsevimab is the first investigational immunization designed to protect all infants across the RSV season with a single dosePivotal Phase 3 results published in The New England Journal of Medicine Paris, March 3, 2022. The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) today published detailed results from a Phase 3 trial evaluating nirsevimab, the first investigational long-acting antibody designed to protect all infants across the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season with a single dose. The trial involved healthy infants born at term or late preterm (35 weeks gestational age or greater) entering their first RSV season and met the primary endpoint, reducing the incidence of medically attended lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia, caused by RSV by 74.5% (95% CI 49.6 to 87.1; P<0.001) compared to placebo.1,2A prespecified pooled analysis of RSV-associated hospitalizations in both the Phase 3 and Phase 2b trials was also conducted. In term and preterm infants (greater than 28 weeks gestational age), the proposed dose of nirsevimab demonstrated efficacy of 77.3% (95% CI 50.3 to 89.7; P<0.001) against RSV-associated hospitalizations.1-3 In the Phase 3 MELODY trial alone, a numerical reduction of the risk of RSV-associated hospitalizations was observed, although not statistically significant (62.1%, 95% CI: -8.6 to 86.8; P=0.07).1,2 In the nirsevimab arm, six of 994 infants were hospitalized for RSV LRTI, while eight of 496 infants were hospitalized in the placebo arm.1,2 Nirsevimab is being developed by Sanofi and AstraZeneca. Dr. William MullerAssociate Professor, Pediatrics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Scientific Director, Clinical and Community Trials, Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago, Illinois“We know that RSV has seen a resurgence with the easing of COVID-19 public health measures. This shows us a broad immunization approach is needed to help mitigate the substantial global burden RSV places on infants, their families and healthcare services. These exciting data show that nirsevimab has the potential to offer RSV protection for all infants, which would be a paradigm shift in the approach to this disease.” The results of the Phase 3 and Phase 2/3 clinical trials, combined with the Phase 2b trial and conducted in different trial populations, demonstrate nirsevimab’s potential to protect all infants across the RSV season with a single dose.1-6 Jean-François ToussaintGlobal Head of Research and Development Vaccines, Sanofi “With three pivotal late-stage trials, our research has been focused on delivering a first-in-class RSV prevention for all infants. Our Phase 3 MELODY results in healthy late preterm and term infants represent a major milestone toward that goal. We are pleased nirsevimab has the potential to become the first immunization to protect all infants across the RSV season, with only a single dose.” Potential to provide rapid protection Nirsevimab is the first investigational long-acting antibody designed to protect all infants during their first RSV season. With nirsevimab, the goal is to provide rapid and direct protection to the infant through a single immunization. It is the first potential immunization to show protection against RSV in infants in a Phase 3 trial.1,2 RSV is the most common cause of LRTI, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia, and a leading cause of hospitalizations in all infants.7-9 Mene PangalosExecutive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, AstraZeneca“Respiratory syncytial virus is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections, such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia, as well as hospitalizations in infants.  These data show for the first time, the potential to significantly protect all infants through their first RSV season with a single-dose immunization and we look forward to working with health authorities to bring nirsevimab to infants as quickly as possible.” The safety and tolerability of nirsevimab compared to palivizumab was evaluated in the Phase 2/3 trial, which demonstrated nirsevimab had a similar safety and tolerability profile compared to palivizumab when administered to infants with congenital heart disease, chronic lung disease and prematurity (35 weeks gestational age or fewer) entering their first RSV season.5,6 Safety was assessed by monitoring the occurrence of all treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and treatment emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) through 360 days post-dose. The serum levels of nirsevimab following dosing at Day 151 in this trial were comparable with those observed in the Phase 3 trial, indicating similar protection in this population to that in the healthy term and late preterm infants is likely.1,2,5,6 Details from the Phase 2/3 trial were also published in NEJM. The study is ongoing, and topline results were presented at RSVVW’21.  Regulatory submissions have begun in the first half of 2022. About the Phase 3 trial  MELODY is a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial conducted across 21 countries designed to determine the incidence of medically attended LRTI due to RSV confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing through 150 days after dosing, versus placebo, in healthy infants entering their first RSV season.1,2 Healthy late preterm and term infants (35 weeks gestational age or greater) were randomized (2:1) to receive a single 50mg (in infants weighing <5kg) or 100mg (in infants weighing ≥5kg) intramuscular injection of nirsevimab or placebo. Between July 2019 and February 2021, 1,490 infants were randomized to either nirsevimab or placebo at the RSV season start.1,2 Pooled analyses of the RSV LRTI hospitalization endpoint from both of the MELODY and the Phase 2b trials were prespecified under a multiplicity-protected hierarchical testing strategy. The overall safety profile of nirsevimab in the trial remains consistent with previously reported results. No clinically meaningful differences in safety results between the nirsevimab and placebo groups were seen in MELODY and Phase 2b.1-4 The evaluation of the primary endpoint in the MELODY trial was conducted earlier than anticipated. Global public health measures to control COVID-19 had reduced the circulation of all respiratory viruses, including RSV, at the time of trial enrollment. Sufficient cases had been accrued prior to the pandemic to evaluate nirsevimab’s ability to prevent RSV LRTI versus placebo. An additional 1,500 infants have been enrolled in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres to provide additional safety information.1,2 About the Phase 2/3 trial  MEDLEY is a Phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, palivizumab-controlled trial with the primary objective of assessing safety and tolerability for nirsevimab in preterm infants and infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) and/or chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD) eligible to receive palivizumab.5,6 Between July 2019 and May 2021, approximately 918 infants entering their first RSV season were dosed with either nirsevimab or palivizumab. Safety is assessed by monitoring the occurrence of TEAEs and TESAEs through 360 days post-dose.5,6 The evaluation of the safety and tolerability of nirsevimab in the MEDLEY trial was carried out earlier than anticipated. A primary analysis was conducted to allow earlier assessment of nirsevimab’s safety and tolerability versus palivizumab based on a sufficient number of infants being enrolled and followed through their first RSV season. The results of MEDLEY, MELODY, and the Phase 2b trial demonstrate that nirsevimab provides protection against RSV in all infants with a single dose.1-6 This all-infant population includes preterm, healthy late preterm and term infants, as well as infants with CLD and CHD.  These trials form the basis of regulatory submissions that have begun in first half of 2022. About RSV RSV is a common, contagious virus that causes seasonal epidemics of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), leading to bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants.10-12 It is also a leading cause of hospitalizations in all infants.8,9 Globally, in 2015, there were approximately 30 million cases of acute lower respiratory infections leading to more than three million hospitalizations, and it was estimated that there were 60,000 in-hospital deaths of children younger than five years.12,13 In recent months, there has been a resurgence of RSV following the easing of COVID-19 public health measures.14,15 Most hospitalizations for RSV occur in otherwise healthy infants born at term.16,17 Medically attended LRTIs are associated with increased costs to the healthcare system.18 About nirsevimab  Nirsevimab is an investigational long-acting antibody designed to protect all infants through their first RSV season with a single dose. Due to its extended half-life technology, nirsevimab is being developed as a single dose for all infants experiencing their first RSV season and infants with specific conditions, such as congenital heart disease or chronic lung disease, entering their first and second RSV season.2,6,19 Nirsevimab is an immunization designed to provide direct prophylactic RSV protection to all infants via an antibody to help prevent LRTI caused by RSV. Monoclonal antibodies do not require the activation of the immune system to help offer rapid and direct protection against disease.20 In March 2017, Sanofi and AstraZeneca announced an agreement to develop and commercialize nirsevimab. Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca leads all development and manufacturing activities and Sanofi will lead commercialization activities and record revenues. Under the terms of the global agreement, Sanofi made an upfront payment of €120m, has paid a development milestone of €30m and will pay up to a further €465m upon achievement of certain development and sales-related milestones. The two companies share all costs and profits. Revenue from the agreement is reported as Collaboration Revenue in the Company’s financial statements. Nirsevimab has been granted regulatory designations to facilitate expedited development by several regulatory agencies around the world. These include Breakthrough Therapy Designation by The China Center for Drug Evaluation under the National Medical Products Administration; Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the US Food and Drug Administration; access granted to the European Medicines Agency PRIority MEdicines scheme; Promising Innovative Medicine designation by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; and named “a medicine for prioritized development” under the Project for Drug Selection to Promote New Drug Development in Pediatrics by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED). Nirsevimab is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been reviewed by any regulatory authority.

Download the PDF versionLate-breaking data at 2022 AAAAI Annual Meeting show Dupixent® (dupilumab) significantly improved signs and symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis Dupixent 300 mg weekly is the only biologic medicine to show positive, clinically meaningful Phase 3 results in adults and adolescents with eosinophilic esophagitisData continue to support well-established safety profile of DupixentU.S. and global regulatory filings are planned in 2022 Paris and Tarrytown, N.Y., February 26, 2022. Positive detailed results from a second Phase 3 trial showed that Dupixent® (dupilumab) 300 mg weekly significantly improved the signs and symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) at 24 weeks compared to placebo in patients 12 years and older. Eosinophilic esophagitis is a chronic, progressive type 2 inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. These pivotal data will be presented today at the 2022 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) Annual Meeting during a late-breaking oral abstract session. Evan S. Dellon M.D., M.P.H., Professor of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and co-principal investigator of the trial         “Eosinophilic esophagitis can greatly impact a person’s ability to eat normally, and physicians have to rely on invasive medical procedures to monitor and, in more serious cases, stretch the esophagus. Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatment options that address the underlying drivers of this disease. The data from this trial showed dupilumab taken weekly not only improved patients’ ability to swallow, but also reduced markers of type 2 inflammation in the esophagus, indicating its potential to address a major underlying cause of eosinophilic esophagitis.”  Topline results from the Dupixent 300 mg weekly arm of the trial, which enrolled 80 patients in the Dupixent group and 79 patients in the placebo group, were announced in October 2021 and confirm results from the first Phase 3 trial. The co-primary endpoints at 24 weeks assessed patient-reported measures of difficulty swallowing (change from baseline in the 0-84 Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire, or DSQ), and esophageal inflammation (proportion of patients achieving histological disease remission, defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/high power field hpf). Data presented at the 2022 AAAAI Annual Meeting showed that patients treated with Dupixent 300 mg weekly experienced the following changes by week 24 compared to placebo: 64% reduction in disease symptoms from baseline compared to 41% for placebo (p=0.0008). Patients receiving Dupixent experienced a 23.78 point improvement on the DSQ, compared to a 13.86 point improvement for placebo (p<0.0001); baseline DSQ scores were approximately 38 and 36 points, respectively.Nearly 10 times as many patients receiving Dupixent achieved histological disease remission: 59% of patients achieved histological disease remission compared to 6% of patients receiving placebo (p<0.0001); mean baseline peak levels were 89 and 84 eos/hpf, respectively. The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. For the 24-week treatment period (Dupixent n=80, placebo n=78), overall rates of adverse events were 84% for Dupixent 300 mg weekly and 71% for placebo. Adverse events that were more commonly (≥5%) observed with Dupixent every week included injection site reactions (38% Dupixent, 33% placebo), fever (6% Dupixent, 1% placebo), sinusitis (5% Dupixent, 0% placebo), COVID-19 (5% Dupixent, 0% placebo) and hypertension (5% Dupixent, 1% placebo). No imbalance was observed in rates of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events between Dupixent (3%) and placebo (3%) groups prior to week 24. The trial also found that significantly more patients treated with Dupixent 300 mg every two weeks reduced their esophageal eosinophilic count to the normal range compared to placebo; however there was not a significant improvement in dysphagia symptoms. Detailed results on the every two week dosing will be presented at an upcoming congress. Data from the clinical trial program have been submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Global regulatory filings in other countries are also planned in 2022. In September 2020, the U.S. FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Dupixent for the treatment of patients 12 years and older with EoE. Dupixent was also granted Orphan Drug designation for the potential treatment of EoE in 2017. The potential use of Dupixent in EoE is currently under clinical development, and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. About Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) EoE is a chronic, progressive type 2 inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. For patients with EoE, swallowing the smallest amount of food or taking a sip of water can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. This disease can also cause narrowing of the esophagus and dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus may be needed, which is often painful. In severe cases, a feeding tube is the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain. There are approximately 160,000 patients in the U.S. living with EoE who are currently treated, of whom approximately 48,000 have failed multiple treatments. About the Dupixent Eosinophilic Esophagitis Trial The Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adolescents and adults with EoE. This second trial (Part B) enrolled 240 patients aged 12 years and older with EoE, as determined by histological and patient-reported measures. Following the first Phase 3 trial (Part A), in which Dupixent 300 mg weekly was evaluated compared to placebo, the second confirmatory trial evaluated Dupixent 300 mg weekly or every two weeks compared to placebo for a 24-week treatment period.  The clinical trial program is ongoing, with patients from the first and second trials continuing into a 28-week long-term extension trial (Part C). Full results from this trial will be available later this year. About Dupixent Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP).  Dupixent is currently approved in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, as well as certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is also approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world and more than 350,000 patients have been treated globally. Dupilumab Development Program Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation. In addition to the currently approved indications, Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes, including eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3), pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age, Phase 3), chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3), prurigo nodularis (Phase 3), chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3), bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3), chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3), allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.

Download the PDF versionLate-breaking phase 3 data at 2022 AAAAI Annual Meeting show Dupixent® (dupilumab) significantly reduced itch and hives in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria In this Phase 3 trial, Dupixent added to standard-of-care antihistamines nearly doubled reduction in itch and urticaria activity scores compared to standard-of-care alone at 24 weeks in biologic-naïve patients uncontrolled on antihistamines Data reinforce the potential of targeting IL-4 and IL-13, key drivers of type 2 inflammation, in this complex, chronic diseaseData support the well-established safety profile of Dupixent Paris and Tarrytown, N.Y., February 26, 2022. Detailed results from a Phase 3 trial showed that adding Dupixent® (dupilumab) to standard-of-care antihistamines significantly reduced itch and hives at 24 weeks in biologic-naïve patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) compared to antihistamines alone in this investigational setting. These results will be presented today in a late-breaking session at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) Annual Meeting. Marcus Maurer, M.D.Professor of Dermatological Allergology, Clinic for Dermatology, Venerology and Allergology at the Charité University of Medicine in Berlin, Germany “Despite standard-of-care antihistamines, many patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria continue to struggle with extreme itch, burning and pain associated with hives and swelling under the skin, which can significantly disrupt their daily lives. These encouraging results showed that, in those unable to achieve disease control on antihistamines alone, patients who added dupilumab experienced improved signs and symptoms and better control of their disease.”   Topline results from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3  trial, which met primary and all key secondary endpoints at week 24, were announced in July 2021. Data presented at AAAAI 2022 showed that patients who added Dupixent to standard-of-care antihistamines nearly doubled the reduction in itch and urticaria activity compared to standard-of-care alone (referred to as “placebo”) with continuous improvement out to 24 weeks. These patients experienced a: 63% reduction in itch severity with Dupixent versus 35% with placebo, as measured by a 0-21 point itch severity scale (10.24 point reduction with Dupixent versus 6.01 point reduction with placebo, p<0.001), the primary endpoint in the U.S. (secondary endpoint in the EU).65% reduction in urticaria activity (itch and hive) severity with Dupixent versus 37% with placebo, as measured by a 0-42 point urticaria activity scale (20.53 point reduction with Dupixent versus 12.00 point reduction with placebo, p<0.001), the primary endpoint in EU (secondary endpoint in the U.S.) The trial demonstrated safety results similar to the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatological indications For the 24-week treatment period, overall rates of adverse events were generally similar between the Dupixent and placebo groups (50% Dupixent, 59% placebo). The most common adverse event was injection site reactions (11% Dupixent, 13% placebo). The potential use of Dupixent in CSU is currently under clinical development, and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. About Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU)CSU is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by the sudden onset of hives on the skin and/or swelling deep under the skin. Despite standard-of-care treatment, people with CSU often experience symptoms including a persistent itch or burning sensation, which can be debilitating and significantly impact quality of life. Swelling often occurs on the face, hands and feet, but can also affect the throat and upper airways. CSU is typically treated with antihistamines, but the disease remains uncontrolled for up to 50% of patients who have limited available treatment options. More than 300,000 people in the U.S. have moderate-to-severe CSU that does not respond adequately to antihistamines alone. About the Dupixent Phase 3 CSU Program (LIBERTY-CUPID)Study A of the Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled LIBERTY-CUPID clinical program evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent as an add-on therapy to standard-of-care antihistamines compared to antihistamines alone in 138 patients aged 6 years and older with CSU who remained symptomatic despite antihistamine use and were not previously treated with omalizumab (i.e., biologic-naïve). The primary endpoints assessed the change from baseline in itch (measured by the weekly itch severity score ISS7, 0-21 scale) and the change from baseline in itch and hives (measured by the weekly urticaria activity score UAS7, 0-42 scale) at 24 weeks.  Study B of the CSU clinical program evaluated Dupixent in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), who were refractory to omalizumab, was recently stopped due to futility based on a pre-specified interim analysis, although numeric improvements were observed across key endpoints. The safety data were generally consistent with Study A and the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatological indications. The companies remain committed to advancing Dupixent for patients with CSU uncontrolled on antihistamines and are evaluating next steps based on results across both trials in the Phase 3 program. About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). In the U.S., Dupixent is approved in patients aged 6 years and older with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis; as an add-on maintenance treatment of patients aged 6 years and older with moderate-to-severe asthma characterized by an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma; and for use with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults whose disease is not controlled. Dupixent is also approved in Europe, Japan and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world, and more than 350,000 patients have been treated globally.

Download the PDF versionNew preclinical tolebrutinib data demonstrated superior brain penetration and potency  Preclinical findings showed that tolebrutinib, among the investigational BTK inhibitors tested, had the best combination of brain penetration and potency that reinforces its potential to impact neuroinflammation Paris, February 24, 2022. New preclinical data demonstrated that tolebrutinib, Sanofi’s investigational oral Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), was the only BTK inhibitor with sufficient central nervous system (CNS) exposure and potency to modulate BTK signaling pathways within the CNS, as compared with evobrutinib and fenebrutinib. These results are being presented in a live poster presentation at the 7th annual Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) Forum. Disability accumulation, or worsening of neurologic function, remains a reality for many people living with MS. Inhibition of BTK, an important intracellular signaling pathway within the CNS, is being investigated as an MS treatment strategy. However, to effectively inhibit BTK within the CNS, investigational therapies must cross the blood-brain barrier with sufficient exposure to engage targets and modulate signaling.         In experiments using well-established preclinical methods, tolebrutinib was shown to be more potent than evobrutinib (50x) and fenebrutinib (9.3x), resulting in durable BTK inhibition. The analyses comprised in vitro kinase and cellular assays and in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in non-human primates cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis). These data reinforce that targeting BTK has the potential to target inflammation both in the periphery and directly in the CNS. Further research is needed to determine the potential clinical efficacy and safety of tolebrutinib in treating MS.  Tim Turner, PhDGlobal Project Head for Tolebrutinib, Sanofi“Based on this preclinical analysis comparing late-stage BTK inhibitors, tolebrutinib demonstrated a superior combination of CSF exposure and potency that exceeded the IC90, a measure of substantial target engagement in the brain. These data make us optimistic about the potential for tolebrutinib to address the drivers of disability in the CNS, and we look forward to seeing the first Phase 3 readouts next year.”   Sanofi will host a virtual investor session to review data presented at ACTRIMS and provide an update on the company’s broader neurology portfolio. The audio webcast and conference call for investors will include presentations followed by a Q&A session. The session will be held on February 25 from 10:00-11:00 EST/ 16:00-17:00 CET; to register, click here.  About the Study The study characterized the relative potency and CNS exposure of tolebrutinib, evobrutinib, and fenebrutinib in a preclinical model of MS. Analyses of in vitro kinase profiling assays determined that tolebrutinib inhibited BTK 64 times faster than evobrutinib (Kinact/Ki value of 4.37 x 10-3 versus 6.82 x 10-5 nM-1*s-1), and ~1,780 times faster than fenebrutinib. Assays measuring antigen-stimulated B cell activation were consistent with in vitro kinase assays and showed potent BTK inhibition with tolebrutinib (estimated IC50 value of 3.2nM, compared to 80.9nM for evobrutinib and 19.8nM for fenebrutinib). Researchers translated the in vitro results to determine each drug candidate’s potential in vivo pharmacokinetics. All three agents, administered as a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg daily, achieved similar CSF concentrations in cynomolgus monkeys. Tolebrutinib CSF concentrations (4.8 ng/mL) (kp,uu CSF=0.40) exceeded the estimated IC90 (3.1 ng/mL), while both evobrutinib (3.2 ng/mL) (kp,uu CSF=0.13) and fenebrutinib (12.9 ng/mL) (kp,uu CSF=0.15) failed to reach exposure levels approaching their IC90 values (144 and 40.6 ng/mL, respectively). The analyses of in vitro kinase and cellular assays were conducted by a third-party vendor and test articles were provided in a blinded fashion, identified by a code generated by Sanofi.  In the non-human primate pharmacokinetic studies, three healthy male animals were used in a crossover study conducted by a third-party vendor. All test articles were provided in a blinded fashion.    About tolebrutinib Tolebrutinib is an investigational brain-penetrant Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor that achieves CSF concentrations needed for targeting B lymphocytes and microglial cells. Tolebrutinib is being evaluated in Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS (RMS), non-relapsing secondary progressive MS (nrSPMS), and primary progressive MS (PPMS), and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority worldwide.

Download the PDF versionSanofi and GSK to seek regulatory authorization for COVID-19 vaccine * Final analysis of the global VAT02 booster trial confirms universal ability to boost neutralizing antibodies 18- to 30-fold across vaccine platforms (mRNA, adenovirus) * In the VAT08 Phase 3 primary series trial, two doses of the Sanofi-GSK vaccine in seronegative populations demonstrated:* 100% efficacy against severe COVID-19 disease and hospitalizations * 75% efficacy against moderate or severe COVID-19 disease* 57.9% efficacy against any symptomatic COVID-19 disease, in line with expected vaccine effectiveness in today’s environment dominated by variants of concern  * Favorable safety profile following both primary series and booster vaccinations Paris, February 23, 2022. Sanofi and GSK today announce that they intend to submit data from both their booster and Phase 3 efficacy trials as the basis for regulatory applications for a COVID-19 vaccine.  The public health relevance of the refrigerator temperature-stable adjuvanted protein-based Sanofi-GSK vaccine is strongly supported by the induction of robust immune responses and a favorable safety profile in multiple settings. In participants who had received a primary series of an already authorized mRNA or adenovirus vaccine, the Sanofi-GSK booster vaccine induced a significant increase in neutralizing antibodies of 18- to 30-fold across vaccine platforms and age groups. When the Sanofi-GSK vaccine was used as a two-dose primary series followed by a booster dose, neutralizing antibodies increased 84- to 153-fold compared to pre-boost levels (see Figures 1a and 1b for details). Thomas TriompheExecutive Vice President, Sanofi Vaccines“We’re very pleased with these data, which confirm our strong science and the benefits of our COVID-19 vaccine. The Sanofi-GSK vaccine demonstrates a universal ability to boost all platforms and across all ages. We also observed robust efficacy of the vaccine as a primary series in today’s challenging epidemiological environment. No other global Phase 3 efficacy study has been undertaken during this period with so many variants of concern, including Omicron, and these efficacy data are similar to the recent clinical data from authorized vaccines.” Roger ConnorPresident of GSK Vaccines“The evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 demonstrates the need for a variety of vaccines. Our adjuvanted protein-based vaccine candidate uses a well-established approach that has been applied widely to prevent infection with other viruses including pandemic flu. We are confident that this vaccine can play an important role as we continue to address this pandemic and prepare for the post-pandemic period.” When used as a two-dose primary series, the Sanofi-GSK vaccine delivered robust levels of neutralizing antibodies, with GMTs reaching 3711 units. For comparison, a panel of sera from volunteers in the same age range who received two doses of an already approved and highly effective mRNA vaccine displayed a GMT of 1653 units, measured simultaneously in the same laboratory.  Data from the VAT08 efficacy study showed that two doses of Sanofi-GSK vaccine generated an efficacy of 57.9% (95% confidence interval CI, 26.5, 76.7) against any symptomatic COVID-19 disease in the seronegative population. The Sanofi-GSK vaccine provided 100% protection (0 vs 10 cases post-dose 1, 0 vs 4 cases post-dose 2) against severe disease and hospitalizations and 75% (3 vs 11 cases) efficacy against moderate-to-severe disease in seronegative populations. While sequencing is still in progress, early data indicate 77% efficacy against any Delta variant-associated symptomatic COVID-19 disease, in line with expected vaccine effectiveness.  Across both studies, the Sanofi-GSK vaccine was well-tolerated in younger and older adults with no safety concerns.  The companies are in discussions with regulatory authorities, including the US FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA), and plan to submit the totality of the data generated with this vaccine candidate to support regulatory authorizations.  Figure 1a - Pre- vs post-booster neutralizing antibody titers in 18-55-yr old participants. Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) (95% CI).  Figure 1b - Pre- vs post-booster neutralizing antibody in ≥56-yr old participants. Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) (95% CI). To evaluate the immunogenicity of the Sanofi-GSK vaccine as a booster, human immune sera samples were tested by Monogram Biosciences San Francisco, CA using an FDA-approved standardized pseudovirus neutralization test (pVNT) against the D614G prototype virus. About VAT08 and VAT02The Phase 3 trial, VAT08 is evaluating a 10µg antigen formulation of the SARS-CoV-2 adjuvanted recombinant protein-based vaccine for efficacy, immunogenicity and safety compared to a placebo. Stage one of the trial is assessing the efficacy of a vaccine formulation containing the spike protein against the original D614 (parent) virus in more than 10,000 participants >18 years of age, randomized to receive two doses of 10µg vaccine or placebo at day 1 and day 22 across sites in the US, Asia, Africa and Latin America. Enrolment recently completed for a second stage in the trial, evaluating a second bivalent formulation, including the spike protein of the B.1.351 (Beta) variant. The Phase 3 trial follows positive initial results from a Phase 2 clinical trial (VAT00002). In that trial, the COVID-19 vaccine candidate was administered to 722 adults to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of 2 doses and to identify an optimal dosing for use as a booster. Results showed strong rates of neutralizing antibody response with 95% to 100% seroconversion following a second injection in all age groups (18 to 95 years old), across all doses.  Full study results for both VAT08 and VAT02 will be published later this year.  These efforts are supported by federal funds from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, part of the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Defense Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense under Contract # W15QKN-16-9-1002 and by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).

Download the PDF versionUpdate on ongoing Dupixent® (dupilumab) chronic spontaneous urticaria Phase 3 program In a Phase 3 trial in patients refractory to omalizumab, Dupixent did not reach statistical significance in an interim analysis despite numeric improvements observed across key endpoints; trial will be stopped due to futilityPositive results from a previous Phase 3 trial in biologic-naïve patients showed Dupixent significantly reduced itch and hives compared to standard of care Companies remain committed to advancing Dupixent for patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria uncontrolled on antihistamines and are evaluating next steps PARIS and TARRYTOWN, N.Y., February 18, 2022. A Phase 3 trial (CUPID STUDY B) evaluating Dupixent® (dupilumab) in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), who were refractory to omalizumab, will stop due to futility based on a pre-specified interim analysis. Although positive numerical trends in reducing itch and hives were observed, the results from the interim analysis did not demonstrate statistical significance for the primary endpoints. The analysis was conducted by an independent interim analysis review committee. In the trial, patients who were refractory to omalizumab treatment and uncontrolled on antihistamines received Dupixent plus standard of care compared to standard of care alone for 24 weeks. The safety data were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications.  The LIBERTY-CUPID pivotal program was initiated in 2020 with an accelerated direct-to-Phase 3 strategy. The previously reported Phase 3 trial, which evaluated a different group of patients who were biologic-naïve, met its primary and all key secondary endpoints at 24 weeks showing that adding Dupixent to standard-of-care antihistamines significantly reduced itch and hives compared to antihistamines alone. The companies remain committed to advancing Dupixent for patients with CSU uncontrolled on antihistamines and are evaluating next steps. John Reed, M.D., Ph.D. Executive Vice President, Global Head of Research and Development at Sanofi “Although we are disappointed in these latest results, this interim analysis contributes to furthering our understanding of the role of type 2 inflammation in this subset of CSU patients who are refractory to all other approved therapies. Based on the results seen in our first Phase 3 trial, and the numerical trends observed in this interim analysis, we remain committed to advancing Dupixent as an option for patients suffering from CSU who are uncontrolled on anti-histamines. We look forward to discussing next steps with regulators.” Detailed results from the first trial will be presented at the AAAAI Annual Meeting later this month and the companies expect to share results from the second trial in a scientific forum. Sanofi and Regeneron are rapidly advancing a broad clinical development program to evaluate Dupixent in diseases with significant unmet need and where type 2 inflammation may play a role. The companies also recently announced positive Phase 3 results in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and prurigo nodularis (PN), and additional results are also expected later this year in pediatric EoE, chronic inducible urticaria-cold (CindU), and hand and foot atopic dermatitis. The potential use of Dupixent in CSU, EoE, PN, CindU and hand and foot atopic dermatitis are currently under clinical development and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. About Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria CSU is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by the sudden onset of hives on the skin and/or swelling deep under the skin. Despite standard-of-care treatment, people with CSU often experience symptoms including a persistent itch or burning sensation, which can be debilitating and significantly impact quality of life. Swelling often occurs on the face, hands and feet, but can also affect the throat and upper airways. About the Dupixent Phase 3 Program in CSU (LIBERTY-CUPID) Study B of the Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled LIBERTY-CUPID clinical program evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 83 patients with CSU aged 12 to 80 years who remained symptomatic despite standard-of-care treatment and were intolerant or incomplete responders to omalizumab. During the 24-week treatment period, patients received Dupixent, or placebo every two weeks added to standard-of-care antihistamines.  The primary endpoints assessed the change from baseline in itch (measured by the weekly itch severity score) and the change from baseline in itch and hives (measured by the weekly urticaria activity score) at 24 weeks. Study A of clinical program evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent as an add-on therapy to standard-of-care antihistamines compared to antihistamines alone in 138 patients aged 6 years and older with CSU who remained symptomatic despite antihistamine use and were not previously treated with omalizumab. About Dupixent Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic rinusinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Dupixent is currently approved in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, as well as certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is also approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world and more than 350,000 patients have been treated globally. Dupilumab Development Program Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation. In addition to the currently approved indications, Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes including chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3), chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3), pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age, Phase 3), prurigo nodularis (Phase 3), eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3), bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3), chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3), allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.

Download the PDF version Media Update   Nirsevimab EMA regulatory submission accepted under accelerated assessment for RSV protection in all infants Nirsevimab is the first investigational long-acting antibody designed to protect all infants for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season with a single doseEuropean regulatory decision could come as early as second half of 2022If approved, nirsevimab will be the first immunization of its kind aiming to provide RSV protection in all infants  Paris, February 17, 2022. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has accepted the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for nirsevimab under an accelerated assessment procedure. Nirsevimab, the first investigational long-acting antibody designed to protect all infants against medically attended lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season, is being developed by Sanofi and AstraZeneca. Nirsevimab is being investigated as a single dose for all infants experiencing their first RSV season. The EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) granted nirsevimab accelerated assessment as it was deemed of major interest for public health and therapeutic innovation. Accelerated assessment aims to reduce the timeframe for the CHMP to review a MAA compared to the standard procedure and follows the EMA granting access to the PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) scheme in 2019. Jean-François Toussaint Global Head of Research and Development Vaccines, Sanofi “RSV is a leading cause of hospitalization in all infants, and recent spikes in bronchiolitis and hospitalizations caused by RSV infection around the globe further demonstrate the need for a preventative option that can help protect all infants. We are pleased to receive this regulatory filing acceptance and remain confident in nirsevimab’s potential to change the current RSV prevention paradigm as a possible single dose option that may offer sustained protection to all infants for the season.” The MAA is based on positive results from the Phase 3 MELODY trial, Phase 2/3 MEDLEY trial, and Phase 2b trial which demonstrated nirsevimab’s efficacy against LRTI due to RSV with a single dose for the RSV season and was well tolerated. Data from the MELODY and MEDLEY trials will be published in an upcoming peer-reviewed journal.  Mene PangalosExecutive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, AstraZeneca“Each year, respiratory syncytial virus causes seasonal epidemics of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and preventative options are currently limited to infants at higher risk. We are excited that the EMA has accepted this regulatory submission under an accelerated assessment procedure, as nirsevimab has the potential to be the first immunization to offer protection for all infants against respiratory syncytial virusas shown by the extensive clinical trial program.” Additional global regulatory submissions are planned in 2022.  About RSV  RSV is a common, contagious virus that causes seasonal epidemics of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), and is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia, in infants.1-4 It is also a leading cause of hospitalizations in all infants.5,6 Globally, in 2015, there were approximately 30 million cases of acute lower respiratory infections leading to more than three million hospitalizations, and it was estimated that there were 60,000 in-hospital deaths of children younger than five years.3,7 In recent months, there has been a resurgence of RSV following the easing of COVID-19 public health measures.8,9 Most hospitalizations for RSV occur in otherwise healthy infants born at term.10,11 Medically attended LRTIs are associated with increased costs to the healthcare system.12 About nirsevimab  Nirsevimab is an investigational long-acting antibody designed to protect all infants for the RSV season with a single dose. Due to its extended half-life technology, nirsevimab is being developed as a single dose for all infants experiencing their first RSV season and infants with specific conditions, such as congenital heart disease or chronic lung disease, entering their first and second RSV season.13-15 Nirsevimab is an immunization designed to provide direct prophylactic RSV protection to all infants via an antibody to help prevent LRTI caused by RSV. Monoclonal antibodies do not require the activation of the immune system to help offer rapid and direct protection against disease.16         In March 2017, Sanofi and AstraZeneca announced an agreement to develop and commercialize nirsevimab. Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca leads all development and manufacturing activities and Sanofi will lead commercialization activities and record revenues. Under the terms of the global agreement, Sanofi made an upfront payment of €120m, has paid a development milestone of €30m and will pay up to a further €465m upon achievement of certain development and sales-related milestones. The two companies share all costs and profits. Revenue from the agreement is reported as Collaboration Revenue in the Company’s financial statements. Nirsevimab has been granted regulatory designations to facilitate expedited development by several regulatory agencies around the world. These include Breakthrough Therapy Designation by The China Center for Drug Evaluation under the National Medical Products Administration; Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the US Food and Drug Administration; access granted to the European Medicines Agency PRIority MEdicines scheme; Promising Innovative Medicine designation by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; and named “a medicine for prioritized development” under the Project for Drug Selection to Promote New Drug Development in Pediatrics by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED). Nirsevimab is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been reviewed by any regulatory authority.

Download the PDF versionFDA accepts Dupixent® (dupilumab) for Priority Review in children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis If approved, Dupixent will be the first biologic medicine available in the U.S. to treat uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis for these young children  Paris and Tarrytown, N.Y., February 10, 2022. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent® (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment for children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. The target action date for the FDA decision on this investigational use is June 9, 2022. Dupixent remains the only biologic medicine approved for patients 6 years of age and older in this indication. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic type 2 inflammatory skin disease, and 85 to 90% of patients develop symptoms (onset of disease) before 5 years of age, which can often continue through adulthood. Symptoms include intense, persistent itch and skin lesions that cover much of the body, resulting in skin dryness, cracking, pain, redness or darkening, and crusting and oozing, along with increased risk of skin infections. Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis may also significantly impact the quality of life of a young child, their parents and caregivers. Current treatment options in this age group are primarily topical steroids, which can be associated with safety risks and may impair growth when used long-term. The sBLA is supported by data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent added to standard-of-care topical corticosteroids (TCS) in children aged 6 months to 5 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The trial met all primary and secondary endpoints, showing that Dupixent and TCS significantly improved skin clearance and reduced overall disease severity and itch at 16 weeks compared to TCS alone. Safety results were generally consistent with the safety profile of Dupixent in atopic dermatitis for patients aged 6 years and older. The most common adverse events that were more commonly observed with Dupixent included conjunctivitis and herpes viral infections. The use of Dupixent in children younger than 6 years of age with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. In 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for Dupixent for the treatment of severe atopic dermatitis (in children aged 6 months to 11 years). About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). In the U.S., Dupixent is approved in patients aged 6 years and older with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis; as an add-on maintenance treatment of patients aged 6 years and older with moderate-to-severe asthma characterized by an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma; and for use with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults whose disease is not controlled. Dupixent is also approved in Europe, Japan and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world, and more than 350,000 patients have been treated globally. Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation. In addition to the currently approved indications, Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes, including pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age, Phase 3), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3), eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3), bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3), prurigo nodularis (Phase 3), chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3), chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3), chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3), allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2).

Download the PDF versionOlipudase alfa shown to provide sustained improvement across multiple clinical manifestations of ASMD Investigational data from long-term, follow-up studies showed that olipudase alfa provided sustained improvement in lung function (as measured by DLco) and reduction of spleen and liver volumes over time in patients with ASMDIf approved, olipudase alfa will become the first-and-only therapy for the treatment of ASMD Paris, February 9, 2022. Positive results from long-term, open-label extension studies demonstrated that olipudase alfa provided sustained improvement in lung function (as measured by diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, or DLco) and reduction of spleen and liver volumes in adult and pediatric patients with non-central nervous system (non-CNS) manifestations of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), a rare, progressive, and potentially life-threatening disease with no approved treatments. The data consist of 6.5-year outcomes for five adult patients with ASMD and 2-year outcomes in 20 pediatric patients, as well as the open-label extension from the Phase 3 ASCEND trial in adults. These data were presented at the 18th annual WORLDSymposiumTM held this week in San Diego, California.  Alaa Hamed, MD, MPH, MBAGlobal Head of Medical Affairs, Rare Diseases, Sanofi“ASMD can lead to progressive damage across multiple organ systems, and the risk of premature death often increases as symptoms become worse. Currently, patients living with this extremely rare disease have no treatment options. These collective findings demonstrate the promise of olipudase alfa to positively impact the progressive nature of ASMD, providing improvement that was observed early and did not diminish over an extended follow-up period up to 6.5 years."" Long-term Data in Adult and Pediatric Patients with ASMD A single-arm, open-label, long-term trial (NCT02004704) enrolled five adult patients and 20 pediatric patients, all with ASMD, from two different parent clinical trials (NCT01722526 and NCT02292654, respectively). The primary objective of this long-term study was to assess the safety of olipudase alfa in patients exposed to long-term treatment with the investigational enzyme replacement therapy. Data from Five Adult Patients over 6.5 Years Five adult patients with non-CNS manifestations of ASMD, aged 22 to 47 years, received olipudase alfa in an open-label Phase 1b trial. After six months, all five patients transitioned to the long-term study, in which they received olipudase alfa for a total of 6.5 years. Efficacy and safety outcomes from these five adults were reported. Improvements were demonstrated in all patients; at 6.5 years of follow-up (all values are reported from the baseline of the original study): The percent predicted DLco mean increase was 55.3%Spleen volume mean decrease was 59.5%Liver volume mean decrease was 43.7% Nearly all adverse events (99%) were mild, with no serious treatment-related adverse events, and all five patients currently remain in the long-term study. Four of the five patients had protocol-defined infusion-associated reactions; 78% of these occurred during the first year of treatment. The most common treatment-related adverse events were: abdominal pain, arthralgia, and nausea (all were considered related in four patients), and headache (which was considered related in three patients). Data from 20 Pediatric Patients over 2 Years 20 pediatric patients with ASMD, aged 1 to 17 years, were enrolled in a single-arm, open-label, Phase 2 trial in seven countries (ASCEND-Peds). Children with rapidly progressive neurological disease were excluded. The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of olipudase alfa at a dose-escalation regimen up to 3 mg/kg administered intravenously every two weeks for 64 weeks. Following the open-label ASCEND-Peds trial, all patients continued treatment in the long-term safety study of olipudase alfa. This study showed that olipudase alfa was generally well tolerated over the two years, with the majority of adverse events (99%) during Weeks 65 to 104 being mild and moderate. Seven serious adverse events were observed in four patients (three in Year 1 and one in Year 2): one patient had an anaphylactic reaction but restarted treatment after tailored desensitization and reached the target dose; one patient had two events of transient alanine aminotransferase elevation; one patient had urticaria and rash; and one patient had two hypersensitivity reactions. The study also explored efficacy endpoints of progressive lung disease and of spleen and liver enlargement. Among the nine patients able to perform baseline pulmonary function tests (primarily age-dependent), the percent predicted DLco showed a mean increase of 46.6% from baseline (of the original study) to Year 2. During the second year, spleen and liver volumes showed a mean decrease of 60.9% and 49% from baseline (of the original study), respectively, at Month 24 for both. Data in Adult Patients with ASMD (ASCEND Extension Period) In the double-blind ASCEND clinical trial (NCT02004691), 36 patients were randomized to receive either olipudase alfa or placebo. In the primary analysis period (52 weeks), the first independent primary endpoint, DLco, was met; therefore, ASCEND was declared positive. The other independent primary endpoint measuring the effect of olipudase alfa on spleen volume was met per the study protocol. For the U.S., the spleen volume endpoint was further combined with a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measurement of symptoms associated with enlarged spleen called Splenomegaly Related Score (SRS). Compared to baseline, the SRS improved to a similar extent in both the olipudase alfa and placebo arms; therefore, this combination endpoint was not met. Findings from the primary analysis were previously presented at the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) 2020 Virtual Meeting. Following the one-year primary analysis, 33 adult ASMD patients completed a second year in the open-label, single-arm extension evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of olipudase alfa. Patients randomized to olipudase alfa at study entry (n=18) and continuing to receive olipudase alfa maintained the benefits throughout Year 2 (all values reported from baseline): The percent predicted DLco mean increase was 28.5%, n=10 (Year 1 increase: 22.2%, n=17)Spleen volume mean decrease was 47%, n=14 (Year 1 decrease: 39.5%, n=17)Liver volume mean decrease was 33.4%, n=14 (Year 1 decrease: 27.8%, n=17) Melissa Wasserstein, MDChief, Division of Pediatric Genetic Medicine, Children's Hospital at Montefiore; Professor of Pediatrics and Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine; and an investigator in the ASCEND trial“These latest clinical findings show olipudase alfa continued to provide improvements in key markers of disease progression, over an extended period of time.” Patients previously treated with placebo (n=18) crossed over to olipudase alfa, with gradual dose escalation to 3 mg/kg. These patients achieved improvements in Year 2 similar to those observed in the olipudase alfa group from the primary analysis period (all values reported from baseline): The percent predicted DLco mean increase was 28%, n=10Spleen volume mean decrease was 36%, n=11 Liver volume mean decrease was 30.7%, n=11 Overall, nearly all treatment-related adverse events (99%) were mild or moderate, with one serious treatment-related adverse event. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache and transient transaminase elevations (i.e., increased levels of liver enzymes). No patient discontinued treatment due to adverse events.  Across all of the open-label, extension studies, olipudase alfa was administered via a dose-escalation regimen up to 3 mg/kg (target maintenance dose), every two weeks via intravenous infusion. About ASMD Historically referred to as Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) type A and type B, ASMD is a rare, progressive, and potentially life-threatening disease for which no treatments are currently approved. ASMD results from a deficient activity of the enzyme acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), which is found in special compartments within cells called lysosomes and is required to breakdown lipids called sphingomyelin. If ASM is absent or not functioning as it should, sphingomyelin cannot be metabolized properly and accumulates within cells, eventually causing cell death and the malfunction of major organ systems. The deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme ASM is due to disease-causing variants in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 gene (SMPD1). The estimated prevalence of ASMD is approximately 2,000 patients in the United States, Europe (EU5 countries), and Japan.    ASMD represents a spectrum of disease caused by the same enzymatic deficiency, with two types that may represent opposite ends of a continuum sometimes referred to as ASMD type A and ASMD type B. ASMD type A is a rapidly progressive neurological form of the disease resulting in death in early childhood. ASMD type B is a serious and potentially life-threatening disease that predominantly, but not only, impacts the lungs, liver, and spleen, as well as other organs. ASMD type A/B represents an intermediate form that includes varying degrees of neurologic involvement. Another type of NPD is NPD type C, which is unrelated to ASMD. About olipudase alfa Olipudase alfa is an investigational enzyme replacement therapy designed to replace deficient or defective ASM, allowing for the breakdown of sphingomyelin. Olipudase alfa is currently being investigated in pediatric and adult patients to treat non-CNS manifestations of ASMD. Olipudase alfa has not been studied in ASMD type A patients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted to olipudase alfa the Breakthrough Therapy designation, which is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions. A Biologics License Application (BLA) for olipudase alfa was submitted to the FDA, and the FDA designated the BLA for Priority Review. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) awarded olipudase alfa the PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) designation, intended to aid and expedite the regulatory process for investigational medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments or that may benefit patients without treatment options. The EMA accepted for review under an accelerated assessment procedure the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for olipudase alfa. In Japan, olipudase alfa was awarded the SAKIGAKE designation, which is intended to promote research and development in Japan for innovative new medical products that satisfy certain criteria, such as the severity of the intended indication. Sanofi filed the J-NDA submission for olipudase alfa. Olipudase alfa has not been approved by any regulatory authority, and its safety and efficacy are currently being evaluated.

Download the PDF versionNexviazyme® (avalglucosidase alfa) shows sustained improvements in respiratory function and mobility in patients with Pompe disease Long-term data from the pivotal Phase 3 COMET trial in late-onset Pompe disease presented at WORLDSymposiumTM 2022Additional data featured included long-term safety and efficacy results from the Phase 2 Mini-COMET study of Nexviazyme in infantile-onset Pompe disease Baby-COMET trial design also featured representing the first study of Nexviazyme in treatment-naive patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease Paris, February 8, 2022. New data demonstrate people living with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), a rare muscle disorder, maintained improvements in respiratory function and mobility following nearly two years of treatment with Nexviazyme® (avalglucosidase alfa). This analysis of an open-label, long-term extension of the randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 COMET trial, will be presented at the 18th annual WORLDSymposiumTM. Long-term efficacy and safety outcomes were assessed in patients who had received continuous treatment with Nexviazyme. In addition, patients treated with Nexviazyme, for at least 48 weeks, after switching from prior treatment with alglucosidase alfa (previously the only available treatment option for Pompe disease and standard of care) were included in the analysis. Over the 97 weeks, there was sustained treatment effect with Nexviazyme along with stabilization of treatment effect in patients switching from alglucosidase alfa in respiratory function (measured by forced vital capacity FVC percent-predicted) and walking distance (measured by the six-minute walk test 6MWT). Priya S. Kishnani, MD C.L. and Su Chen Professor of Pediatrics; Medical Director, YT and Alice Chen Pediatrics Genetics and Genomics Center; and Division Chief, Medical Genetics, Duke University Medical Center“This analysis builds on the positive 49-week results from the Phase 3 COMET trial, evaluating the treatment effect of avalglucosidase alfa over approximately two years in patients with late-onset Pompe disease. In addition, the results support the potential of avalglucosidase alfa to stabilize treatment effect after switching from standard-of-care treatment.” Nexviazyme is an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) designed to specifically target the mannose-6-phosphate receptor, the key pathway for cellular uptake of ERT in Pompe disease. Phase 3 COMET study long-term extension results The COMET study enrolled 100 previously untreated patients with LOPD across 55 centers in 20 countries. The primary endpoint evaluated the change in FVC percent-predicted in the upright position compared to baseline, and a key secondary endpoint measured mobility with the 6MWT compared to baseline. Patients were randomized to receive either Nexviazyme 20 mg/kg or alglucosidase alfa 20 mg/kg intravenous infusion every two weeks for 49 weeks. During the extension period of COMET, patients who had initially received Nexviazyme continued their treatment, while patients who were previously treated with alglucosidase alfa switched to Nexviazyme 20 mg/kg. Of the 95 participants who entered the extension period, 86 (91%) remained on treatment up to last follow-up. After nearly two years, changes (LS mean SE) from baseline at week 97 showed:  Treatment with Nexviazyme in both the primary analysis and extension periods led to a 2.65 (1.05) point improvement in FVC percent-predicted compared to baseline. Patients who were treated with Nexviazyme only during the extension period showed a 0.36 (1.12) point improvement compared to baseline.Patients who were treated with Nexviazyme during both the primary analysis and extension periods experienced an average increase of 18.6 (12.01) meters in walking distance as measured by the 6MWT compared with the distance walked at baseline. Patients who were treated with Nexviazyme only during the extension period showed an average increase of 4.56 (12.44) meters from baseline. The safety profile was comparable between both treatment arms (those treated with Nexviazyme throughout the study and those switching to treatment with Nexviazyme) during treatment with Nexviazyme. No new safety signals were observed in patients who switched from alglucosidase alfa to Nexviazyme during the extension period. Across both groups, five individuals discontinued treatment during the extension period due to adverse events (AEs) (ocular hyperemia, erythema, urticaria, respiratory distress, acute myocardial infarction, pancreatic adenocarcinoma). Six participants experienced serious treatment-emergent adverse reactions potentially related to therapy. Phase 2 Mini-COMET study long-term extension results Also for presentation at the WORLDSymposium are results from the extension period of the Phase 2 Mini-COMET trial. This open-label, ascending-dose, three-cohort study evaluated the safety and efficacy of Nexviazyme in patients under 18 years of age with infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD), a use that remains under investigation in the United States, who previously received alglucosidase alfa for six or more months and showed either a suboptimal response or a clinical decline. Patients were enrolled into one of three cohorts: (1) 20 mg/kg of Nexviazyme every two weeks (n=6), (2) 40 mg/kg of Nexviazyme every two weeks (n=5), and (3) randomized to Nexviazyme 40 mg/kg every two weeks (n=5) or alglucosidase alfa at their pre-enrollment stable dose (within a range of 20mg/kg every two weeks to 40mg/kg weekly n=6). All 22 participants entered an extension period to receive up to 40 mg/kg of Nexviazyme every two weeks. During the extension period: The most commonly reported treatment-emergent AEs were mild to moderate in severity and included rashes (8 participants), falls, pneumonia, pyrexia (7 participants each), headache, upper respiratory tract infections (6 participants each) and vomiting (5 participants). There were no serious or severe treatment-related AEs or deaths.The higher Nexviazyme dose (40 mg/kg every two weeks) had no increased safety risk seen in participants who switched from alglucosidase alfa to Nexviazyme. After two years (at week 97), results showed that patients treated with Nexviazyme showed stable or improved motor function as measured by gross motor function measure (GMFM-88), quick motor function test (QMFT) total percent score, and Pompe-PEDI (Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Index) Functional Skills Scale. Additionally, all participants had a left ventricle mass z-score (LVMZ) score within normal range. Alaa Hamed, M.D., MPH, MBAGlobal Head of Medical Affairs, Rare Diseases, Sanofi “These new data demonstrate the impact of Nexviazyme to provide sustained effect in key disease measures for both late-onset and infantile-onset Pompe disease. The research also adds to a growing body of evidence supporting this treatment’s use as a new standard of care for this debilitating, life-long disease.” Phase 3 Baby-COMET trial methodology The trial design of Baby-COMET, a Phase 3, single group, open-label, multinational, multi-center study will also be presented at the congress. Baby-COMET is the first study of Nexviazyme to include participants with IOPD who have never been treated. This study will determine the effects of Nexviazyme, externally compared with alglucosidase alfa, on overall and ventilator-free survival in participants with IOPD ≤6 months of age at enrollment. About Pompe disease Pompe disease is caused by a genetic deficiency or dysfunction of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), which results in build-up of complex sugars (glycogen) in muscle cells throughout the body. The accumulation of glycogen leads to irreversible damage to the muscles, including the diaphragm muscle that supports lung function and skeletal muscles that affect mobility, as well as cardiac muscles in infantile-onset Pompe disease. Pompe disease can present as infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD), the most severe form of Pompe disease with rapid onset in infancy, and late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), which progressively damages muscles over time. LOPD symptoms may present at any age. However, due to the wide spectrum of clinical presentations and progressive nature of the disease, it can take seven to nine years before patients receive an accurate diagnosis. As the disease progresses, people with LOPD may require mechanical ventilation to help with breathing or a wheelchair to assist with mobility. About Nexviazyme® (avalglucosidase alfa) Nexviazyme® (avalglucosidase alfa) is an enzyme replacement therapy designed to target the mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptor. Nexviazyme is approved in the U.S. for patients with late-onset Pompe disease who are one year of age or older. Use of Nexviazyme for infantile-onset Pompe disease in the U.S. is investigational. Nexviazyme is also approved for the treatment of patients with late-onset Pompe disease and/or infantile-onset Pompe disease in several markets across the world including Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Australia and Brazil. In all other countries, use of Nexviazyme is investigational and its efficacy and safety have not been confirmed by the respective health authority.

Download the PDF versionFDA approves Enjaymo™ (sutimlimab-jome), first treatment for use in patients with cold agglutinin disease

Enjaymo is the only approved treatment to decrease the need for red blood cell transfusion due to hemolysis, the destruction of red blood cells, in adults with cold agglutinin disease (CAD)
Enjaymo addresses a serious and chronic unmet medical need for adults living with CAD, a rare blood disorder

Paris, February 4, 2022. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Enjaymo™ (sutimlimab-jome) to decrease the need for red blood cell transfusion due to hemolysis in adults with cold agglutinin disease (CAD). Enjaymo is the first and only approved treatment for people with CAD and works by inhibiting the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis).
Bill Sibold
Executive Vice President, Head of Specialty Care
“Until now, people living with cold agglutinin disease haven’t had an approved treatment option to manage the constant destruction of red blood cells. Without healthy, viable red blood cells, a chain reaction of debilitating signs and symptoms can be triggered, starting with severe anemia. Enjaymo is the only approved treatment to inhibit red blood cell destruction in CAD and help stop the chain reaction from the start.”
CAD, a rare autoimmune hemolytic anemia, is caused by antibodies called cold agglutinins binding to the surface of red blood cells, which starts a process that causes the body’s immune system to mistakenly attack healthy red blood cells and cause their rupture (hemolysis). As red blood cells have the vital job of carrying oxygen throughout the body, patients with CAD may experience severe anemia, which can result in fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, light-headedness, chest pain, irregular heartbeat, and other potential complications. CAD is a chronic and rare blood disorder that impacts the lives of an estimated 5,000 people in the U.S.
Enjaymo, targeting C1s in the classical complement pathway
Enjaymo is a humanized monoclonal antibody that is designed to selectively target and inhibit C1s in the classical complement pathway, which is part of the innate immune system. By blocking C1s, Enjaymo inhibits the activation of the complement cascade in the immune system and inhibits C1-activated hemolysis in CAD to prevent the abnormal destruction of healthy red blood cells. Enjaymo does not inhibit the lectin and alternative pathways.
Enjaymo Phase 3 pivotal CARDINAL study results supporting approval 
The approval of Enjaymo in the U.S. is based on positive results from the 26-week open label, single arm pivotal Phase 3 study in patients with CAD (n=24) who have a recent history of blood transfusion, also known as the CARDINAL study. 
Catherine Broome, MD
Associate professor of medicine at Georgetown University Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, and a principal investigator in the CARDINAL study 
""For people living with cold agglutinin disease, it is as if their body’s immune system is waging a war on itself. The relentless destruction of healthy red blood cells is a daily, silent reality for people with CAD. For the first time, we have a treatment that targets complement-mediated hemolysis, which is the underlying cause of the red blood cell destruction in many CAD patients. In the pivotal study, patients treated with sutimlimab had an improvement in anemia as measured by hemoglobin and bilirubin levels during the 26-week study.”
In the study, Enjaymo met its primary efficacy endpoint, which was a composite endpoint defined as the proportion of patients who achieved normalization of hemoglobin (Hgb) level ≥12 g/dL or demonstrated an increase from baseline in Hgb level ≥2 g/dL at the treatment assessment time point (mean value from weeks 23, 25, and 26) and no blood transfusion from weeks 5 through 26 or medications prohibited per the protocol from weeks 5 through 26. Secondary endpoints were also met, including improvements in hemoglobin and normalization of bilirubin. 

The majority of patients (54%; n=13) met the composite primary endpoint criteria with 63% (n=15) of patients achieving a hemoglobin ≥ 12 g/dL or an increase of at least 2 g/dL; 71% (n=17) of patients remaining transfusion-free after week five; and 92% (n=22) of patients did not use other CAD-related treatments. 
For the secondary measures on disease process, patients enrolled experienced a mean increase in hemoglobin level of 2.29 g/dL (SE: 0.308) at week 3 and 3.18 g/dL (SE: 0.476) at the 26-week treatment assessment timepoint from the mean baseline level of 8.6 g/dL. The mean reduction in bilirubin levels (n=14) was by -2.23 mg/dL (95% CI: -2.49 to -1.98) from a mean baseline level of 3.23 mg/dL (2.7-fold ULN).

In the CARDINAL study, the most common adverse reactions occurring in 10 percent or more of patients were respiratory tract infection, viral infection, diarrhea, dyspepsia, cough, arthralgia, arthritis, and peripheral edema. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 13 percent (3/24) of patients who received Enjaymo. These serious adverse reactions were streptococcal sepsis and staphylococcal wound infection (n=1), arthralgia (n=1), and respiratory tract infection (n=1). None of the adverse reactions led to discontinuation of Enjaymo in the study. Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 17 percent (4/24) of patients who received Enjaymo. 
Following the completion of the 26-week treatment period of CARDINAL (Part A), eligible patients continued to receive Enjaymo in an extension study.
The recommended dose of Enjaymo is based on body weight (6,500 mg for people 39-75 kg and 7,500 mg for people >75 kg). Enjaymo is administered intravenously weekly for the first two weeks with administration every two weeks thereafter.
Enjaymo is expected to be available in the U.S. in the coming weeks. The U.S. list price, or wholesale acquisition cost, of Enjaymo is $1,800 per vial. Actual costs to patients are generally anticipated to be lower as the list price does not reflect insurance coverage, co-pay support, or financial assistance from patient support programs. As part of our commitment to ensure treatment access and affordability for innovative therapies, Enjaymo Patient Solutions provides disease education, financial and co-pay assistance programs and other support services to eligible patients. For more information, please call 1-833-223-2428.
Enjaymo received FDA Breakthrough Therapy and Orphan Drug designation, and priority review, which is reserved for medicines that, if approved, would represent significant improvements in safety or efficacy in treating serious conditions. Outside of the U.S., sutimlimab has been submitted to regulatory authorities in Europe and Japan and reviews are ongoing.

Fourth-quarter Jevtana® sales decreased 16.8% to €110 million following the entry of generic competition in certain European markets (down 66.0%) at the end of March 2021. In the U.S., sales were up 13.3%, where the Jevtana® composition of matter patent has expired in September 2021. However, Sanofi has filed patent infringement suits against generic filers on Jevtana® under Hatch-Waxman in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware asserting three method of use patents, two of which (US 10,583,110 and US 10, 716,777) expire in October 2030 and the other one (US 8,927,592) expires in April 2031 including 6-month pediatric exclusivities. Sanofi has reached settlement agreements with some of the defendants and the suit against the remaining defendants is ongoing. No trial dates have been scheduled and the remaining defendants have agreed not to launch any generic cabazitaxel product until the earlier of a district court decision in favor of the defendants or four months after the completion of the post-trial briefing. Separately, Jevtana® has been granted a data exclusivity on the CARD clinical study results which expires in December 2023. Fourth-quarter Sarclisa® sales were €54 million (versus €25 million in the fourth quarter of 2020) driven by continued launch execution in Europe (€20 million), sales growth in the U.S. (€21 million) and in the Rest of the World region (€13 million) where sales performance was driven by the uptake in Japan.  Libtayo® (collaboration with Regeneron) sales were €35 million (up 78.9%) in the fourth quarter driven by increased demand in metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) as well as additional country launches.

Excluding industrial sales to Sobi, fourth-quarter sales were up 2.7% mainly driven by Cablivi® and Alprolix®. Industrial sales (of Eloctate® and Alprolix®) to Sobi were significantly lower in 2021 than in 2020 due to a change in the supply agreement which resulted in unusually high industrial sales to Sobi in 2020. In 2021 sales of Rare Blood Disorders decreased 3.0% and were up 8.0.% when excluding industrial sales to Sobi. Eloctate® sales were €141 million in the fourth quarter, down 12.2%. Excluding industrial sales to Sobi, Eloctate sales were down 4.4% due to lower U.S. sales (-3.9%) mainly reflecting inventory fluctuation. Sales in the Rest of the World region were down 28.3% reflecting lower industrial sales to Sobi (which are recorded in this region).  Fourth-quarter Alprolix® sales were down 16.0% to €113 million. Excluding industrial sales to Sobi, Alprolix® sales were up 6.3%. In the U.S. sales were up 5.1%. Sales in the Rest of the World were down 48.1% reflecting lower industrial sales to Sobi (which are recorded in this region).  Cablivi® sales increased by 23.3% to €38 million in the fourth quarter driven by launches in Europe (up 50.0% to €19 million). In the U.S., sales of the product were stable at €19 million, with the COVID-19 environment impacting treatment initiations at the hospital level.  General Medicines Fourth quarter General Medicines sales decreased 3.8% to €3,432 million and 2.3% excluding portfolio streamlining and Praluent® U.S. sales. The growth of core assets2 (up 2.1% to €1,429 million and up 3.9% excluding Praluent® U.S. sales) was driven by Multaq®, Plavix® and RezurockTM (consolidated from November 9). The non-core assets sales decreased 7.6% (to €1,783 million) mainly reflecting lower Generics sales and portfolio streamlining (-1.4 ppt impact).  In 2021, General Medicines sales were down 1.4% to €14,218 million and up 0.4% excluding portfolio streamlining and Praluent® U.S. sales. In 2021, sales of the core assets were €5,768 million up 5.6% (and up 7.6% excluding Praluent® U.S. sales), driven by double-digit growth of Lovenox®, Mozobil® and Thymoglobulin® as well as Toujeo® performance. Non-core assets sales were €7,642 million, down 6.2% reflecting portfolio streamlining (-1.8 ppt), as well as lower Lantus®, Aprovel®/Avapro® and Generics sales.

In 2021, Diabetes sales were down 0.8% mainly as a result of lower Lantus® sales partially offset by growth from Toujeo® and Soliqua®. Fourth-quarter Toujeo® sales increased 1.8% to €230 million due to growth in the U.S. and Europe, partially offset by lower sales in the Rest of the World reflecting price and inventory adjustment in anticipation of the Volume Based Procurement (VBP) for insulins in China which will be implemented in the first half of 2022.  Sanofi has participated in the VBP tender for basal insulin analogues in China in November and was among the bidding winners in the group A with Lantus®/Toujeo® and then has secured a significant volumes of its long-acting insulins at the hospital level. In 2022, Sanofi expects that its glargine sales to decrease by around 30% in China, benefiting from high volumes at significantly lower prices. Toujeo®/Lantus® sales were €459 million in China in 2021. Lantus® sales were €583 million, down 2.9% in the fourth quarter, due to lower sales in Europe and China partially offset by growth in the U.S. In China, sales reflected price and inventory adjustment in anticipation of the insulin VBP.  Fourth-quarter Soliqua® sales increased 13.0% to €54 million driven by growth in all three geographic regions. In the Rest of World region, Soliqua® sales grew 30.0% supported by new launches.

The performance of certain core assets, including Plavix®, Praluent® and Multaq® and the addition of Rezurock® was more than offset by lower sales of Lovenox® and Generics as well as the impact of the divestments of non-core products. In 2021, Cardiovascular and Established Rx Products sales were down 1.8% (down 0.7% excluding Praluent® U.S. sales) impacted by lower Aprovel®/Avapro® and generics sales as well as the impact of the divestments which offset strong growth of several core assets. Fourth-quarter Lovenox® sales decreased 7.9% to €335 million, reflected high base of comparison in the fourth quarter of 2020 when WHO guidelines recommending the use of low molecular weight heparins in hospitalized COVID-19 patients came into effect. In addition, supply limitations and biosimilar competition in Europe (down 11.1%) affected the performance.  Plavix® sales were up 7.5% in the fourth quarter to €222 million due to higher sales in the Rest of the World region (up 11.4%) driven by China (up 28.1% to €88 million) largely offsetting lower sales in Japan and Europe. Fourth-quarter Aprovel®/Avapro® sales were down 6.1% to €112 million.  Fourth-quarter Praluent® sales decreased 15.9% to €55 million, reflecting the restructuring of the collaboration with Regeneron effective April 1, 2020. Sanofi has sole responsibility for Praluent® outside the U.S. while Regeneron has sole responsibility for Praluent® in the U.S. Excluding U.S. sales in the comparable quarter last year, higher Praluent® sales (up 35.9%) were driven by strong performance in Europe. In China, Praluent® is listed on the NDRL (National Reimbursement Drug List) as of January 2022. Multaq® fourth quarter sales grew 20.3% to €99 million, reflecting strong U.S. sales growth. Sales of RezurockTM, a recently FDA-approved, first-in-class treatment for chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) for adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older who have failed at least two prior lines of systemic therapy, were consolidated as of November 9 (through the Kadmon acquisition) and generated €20 million since that date. Pharmaceuticals business operating income In the fourth quarter, business operating income (BOI) of Pharmaceuticals increased 16.4% to €2,091 million (up 12.5% at CER). The ratio of BOI to net sales increased by 1.7 percentage points to 30.2% (29.9% at CER), reflecting an improvement of the gross margin ratio. In 2021, business operating income of Pharmaceuticals increased 2.2% to €9,409 million (up 4.9% at CER). The ratio of BOI to net sales decreased by 1.0 percentage points to 34.9% (35.0% at CER) reflecting strong investments behind Dupixent® partly offset by an improvement in overall gross margin ratio.

Fourth-quarter Vaccines sales decreased 6.5% to €1,964 million, mainly reflecting lower U.S influenza vaccines sales partially offset by successful Efluelda® expansion in Europe and Polio/Pertussis/Hib in the Rest of the World region. In 2021, Vaccines sales increased 6.8% supported by Meningitis, Influenza and PPH vaccines.  In the fourth quarter, Polio/Pertussis/Hib (PPH) vaccines sales increased 7.7% to €543 million driven by Pentaxim® in China and Hexaxim® in Europe. In the U.S., Pentacel® sales decreased due to inventory fluctuation and progressive Vaxelis® ramp-up. Vaxelis® was launched in the U.S. in June 2021, in-market sales are not consolidated and the profits are shared equally between Sanofi and Merck.  Influenza vaccines sales decreased 12.4% in the fourth quarter, reaching €1,093 million. In the U.S. fourth-quarter sales were down 48.3% reflecting lower influenza vaccination rates when compared to last year, which resulted from the prioritization of COVID-19 booster vaccinations at the pharmacy level, as well as record shipments in the third quarter of 2021. In the U.S, Fluzone®HD gained 3.5 points share despite market contracted by ​17% in volume (Sources: IQVIA Claims Medical (as of 1/1/22); IQVIA Claims Retail (as of 1/2/22)​). In Europe, Influenza vaccines sales increased 51.1% driven by the adoption of a preferential recommendation for Efluelda® for people above 60 years old in Germany. In the Rest of the World region, influenza sales increased 22.7%. On a full-year basis, 2021 marked another record year with Influenza vaccines sales up 5.9% to €2,628 million.  Fourth-quarter Meningitis sales decreased 31.2% to €91 million, reflecting a high base of comparison in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2020, when sales benefited from catch-up vaccinations. Booster vaccines sales decreased 1.6% in the fourth quarter to €124 million, due to lower sales in the Rest of the World region partially offset by growth in Europe. Vaccination rates in this segment have not yet returned to pre-COVID levels.  Fourth-quarter Travel and endemic vaccines sales increased 17.1%, reflecting a low base of comparison in the fourth quarter of 2020 due to the pandemic environment. Vaccines business operating income In the fourth quarter, business operating income (BOI) decreased 22.3% (down 23.9% at CER) to €653 million compared to the same period of last year. This reflects lower U.S. influenza vaccines sales and higher R&D expenses related to Translate Bio and the mRNA center of excellence. In the fourth quarter, BOI to net sales ratio was 33.2% (versus 40.8% in the fourth quarter of 2020). In 2021, BOI increased 11.7% (up 12.5% at CER) to €2,609 million benefiting from sales performance and efficiency gain as well as the payment from Daiichi Sankyo in the first quarter of 2021. BOI to net sales ratio increased 2.2 percentage points to 41.3% (41.2% at CER). Excluding the payment from Daiichi Sankyo, BOI to net sales ratio was 39.4% in 2021.

This performance was driven by the Cough and Cold franchise, as well as the Pain Care category which benefited from COVID-19 vaccinations. In 2021 CHC sales increased 4.6% mainly due to the growing sales in Digestive Wellness, Pain Care and Mental Wellness categories which more than offset a weak cough and cold season last winter and the divestments of non-core products (-0.8 ppt impact).  In the U.S., fourth-quarter CHC sales increased 12.6% to €280 million driven by double-digit growth of Allergy, Pain Care, Personal Care and Digestive Wellness categories.  In Europe, fourth-quarter CHC sales increased 7.5% to €345 million mainly reflecting growth of the Cough and Cold and Pain Care franchises which also benefited from COVID-19 vaccinations.  In Rest of World, fourth-quarter CHC sales increased 0.8% to €486 million, supported by Cough and Cold and Digestive Wellness categories, partially offset by lower sales of Allergy, Pain Care and Physical Wellness categories.  CHC business operating income In the fourth quarter, business operating income (BOI) of CHC decreased 2.0.% (-5.3% at CER) to €298 million. The ratio of BOI to net sales decreased 2.7 percentage point to 26.8% versus the prior year which included a capital gain related to divestments of non-strategic assets. In 2021, BOI of CHC increased 5.9% (up 10.2% at CER) to €1,493 million due to higher sales, a strict control of operational expenses and higher capital gains related to divestments of non-strategic assets.

R&D update at the end of the fourth quarter 2021Regulatory update The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dupixent® as an add-on maintenance treatment of children aged 6 to 11 years with moderate-to-severe asthma characterized by an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma. The FDA accepted for Priority Review the Biologics License Application (BLA) for olipudase alfa for the proposed indication as an enzyme replacement therapy for long-term treatment of non–central nervous system (CNS) manifestations of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) in pediatric and adult patients. The target action date (PDUFA) for the FDA decision is July 3, 2022. Historically known as Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) type A and type B, ASMD is an ultra-rare disorder that affects both children and adults. The estimated prevalence of ASMD is approximately 2,000 patients in the U.S., Europe (EU5 countries) and Japan. Due to the rarity of the disease, many patients go undiagnosed or experience delays before receiving an accurate diagnosis, often while the health complications of ASMD continue to progress. Olipudase alfa has received special designations from regulatory agencies worldwide, recognizing the innovation potential of this investigational therapy. Regulatory submissions for olipudase alfa are currently under review in Japan and the European Union. If approved, it will become the first and only therapy available for the treatment of ASMD.The FDA accepted for review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Libtayo® in combination with chemotherapy, for the first line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The target action date (PDUFA) for the FDA decision is September 19, 2022. The European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) reaffirmed its opinion that avalglucosidase alfa does not qualify as a new active substance (NAS). Sanofi does not agree with the CHMP’s conclusion on NAS status and is evaluating potential options for avalglucosidase alfa in the European Union. Portfolio update   Phase 3: A pivotal trial evaluating Dupixent® for the treatment of adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis, met its primary and all key secondary endpoints showing that Dupixent significantly reduced itch and skin lesions compared to placebo in this investigational setting. The impact of uncontrolled prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases with intense and chronic itch. Results from a second phase 3 trial assessing the investigational use of Dupixent® in patients 12 years and older with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) demonstrated that the trial met its co-primary endpoints in patients taking Dupixent 300 mg weekly, showing significant improvements in clinical and histologic disease measures compared to placebo. The study conducted by the German-Speaking Myeloma Multicenter Group (GMMG) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) and treated with Sarclisa® in combination with lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (RVd), met the primary endpoint, the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity after induction therapy and before transplant. This trial is the first Phase 3 study to meet primary endpoint of minimal residual disease negativity in transplant-eligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. The trial is ongoing, following the second randomization to evaluate progression free survival (PFS) for Sarclisa and lenalidomide combination as maintenance therapy. Positive data from two Phase 3 studies (ATLAS-A/B and ATLAS-INH) evaluating the efficacy and safety of fitusiran, an investigational small interference RNA (siRNA) therapy for the prophylactic treatment of adults and adolescents with hemophilia A or B, with or without inhibitors, were presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. Across both clinical studies, prophylactic treatment with fitusiran reduced annualized bleeding rates by >89% compared to the control arms, showing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in bleeds when compared to on-demand treatments, and also showing significant improvement in quality of life. The Phase 3 clinical program is ongoing evaluating the efficacy and safety of fitusiran under an amended protocol which includes lower doses and an extended dosing regimen in all ongoing adult and adolescent studies. Tolebrutinib, the investigational brain-penetrant oral Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, demonstrated favorable one-year tolerability, after 48 weeks of treatment, in a phase 2b long-term extension study in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). Data were presented at the 37th Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS). A new pivotal study evaluating the efficacy and safety of tolebrutinib, for the treatment of Myasthenia Gravis (MG), enrolled its first patient. The multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study evaluates tolebrutinib compared with placebo in 154 adult participants aged 18 to 85 years old with moderate-to-severe MG. The primary endpoint is change in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living Profile (MG-ADL) score, an eight-item patient-reported scale developed to assess MG symptoms and their effects on daily activities. Preliminary results from a clinical trial investigating the safety and immunogenicity of a single booster dose of Sanofi and GSK recombinant adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine candidate showed consistently strong immune responses regardless of the primary vaccine received. Phase 3 trial continues to accrue number of events needed for analysis: results are expected in Q1, 2022. New nirsevimab MEDLEY Phase 2/3 data and an encore MELODY Phase 3 presentation were presented at ReSViNET 2021, reinforcing the potential of an investigational single-dose preventative immunization to help protect all infants entering their first respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season.   Phase 2: The study assessing tusamitamab ravtansine, an anti-CEACAM5 antibody drug conjugate (ADC), in combination with ramucirumab in patients previously treated for gastric cancer, recruited its first patient. Three phase 2 non-randomized, open-label, multi-cohort, multi-center studies evaluating SAR444245, a non-alpha IL-2 (formerly known as THOR707) enrolled their first patients. In these studies, SAR444245 is evaluated in combination with other anti-cancer therapies for the treatment of patients with NSCLC or mesothelioma, or with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and is evaluated with or without other anti-cancer therapies in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell lymphoma. Sanofi plans to recruit more than 500 patients across those three trials. The study evaluating SAR442720, a SHP2 inhibitor also known as RMC-4630, in combination with sotorasib, a KRAS inhibitor, for the second line or later treatment of patients with KRASG12C mutant NSCLC, enrolled its first patient. The primary endpoint of this open-label study with 46 participants is overall response rate (ORR). It is conducted in collaboration with Revolution Medicines and Amgen. The double-blind, 2-arm Phase 2 study monitoring rilzabrutinib, a BTK inhibitor, for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, enrolled its first patient. The primary endpoint of this study is percent change in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score. Seventy participants with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who are inadequate responders or intolerant to topical corticosteroids are planned to be included. The study evaluating SAR441344, an anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody developed in collaboration with Immunext, for the treatment of patients with active systematic lupus erythematosus, enrolled its first patient. Development of Sarclisa® in patients awaiting kidney transplantation has been discontinued Development of SAR445088, a complement C1s inhibitor, in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) has been discontinued. A Phase 2 study in adults with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and a safety and tolerability study in adults with cold agglutinin disease (CAD) continue.   Phase 1: An anti PD-L1 / IL-15 fusion protein, SAR445710, (formerly known as KD033), entered in the Sanofi Phase 1 pipeline for the treatment of solid tumors, following the closing of the acquisition of Kadmon. A first in human study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and anti-leukemic activity in various hematological malignancies of SAR443579, an anti-NKp46/CD123 bispecific monoclonal antibody developed in collaboration with Innate Pharma, enrolled its first patient. Studies for the following new molecular entities in development for the treatment of immuno-inflammatory indications enrolled their first patients: SAR442970, an anti-TNF/OX40L Nanobody® VHH, SAR444336, a pegylated IL-2, SAR443765, an anti-IL-13/TSLP Nanobody® VHH and SAR442999 an anti-TNFa/IL-23A Nanobody® VHH. The study with SAR443809, an anti-Factor Bb monoclonal antibody for the treatment of rare renal diseases, recruited its first patient. Sanofi will be transitioning its rights and obligations related to SAR445136, a zinc finger nuclease gene-edited cell therapy candidate in development by Sangamo and Sanofi for the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD), back to Sangamo over the first half of 2022. Development of SAR439459, an anti-TGFb monoclonal antibody for the treatment of advanced solid tumors, has been discontinued. Development of SAR442085, an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody Fc engineered, for the treatment of multiple myeloma, has been discontinued. Acquisitions and major collaborations On November 9, Sanofi announced the completion of its acquisition of Kadmon Holdings, Inc., further strengthening growth and expansion of the General Medicines portfolio. On November 18, Sanofi announced an equity investment of $180 million and a new strategic collaboration with Owkin, an artificial intelligence and precision medicine company, willing to optimize clinical trial design and detect predictive biomarkers for diseases and treatment outcomes in core areas such as lung cancer, breast cancer and multiple myeloma. On December 1, Sanofi announced the acquisition of Origimm Biotechnology GmbH, a biotechnology company specialized in the discovery of virulent skin microbiome components and antigens from bacteria causing skin disease. On December 21st, Sanofi announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Amunix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., an immuno-oncology company, leveraging its proprietary, clinically validated XTEN® and innovative universal protease-releasable masking technology platform, Pro-XTENTM, to discover and develop transformative T-cell engagers (TCE) and cytokine therapies for patients with cancer. Amunix’s pipeline, which includes lead candidate AMX-818, a masked HER2-directed TCE, offers a strong strategic fit with Sanofi’s focus on developing potentially transformative cancer therapies in immuno-oncology. An update of the R&D pipeline at as of December 31, 2021, is available on our website: https://www.sanofi.com/en/science-and-innovation/research-and-development  Progress on implementation of the Corporate Social Responsibility strategy that is fully integrated in our Play to Win strategy Sanofi Global Health and Medtronic Labs to collaborate to expand access to healthcare in Low to Middle Income Countries Globally, Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) are responsible for 41 million yearly deaths, equivalent to 71% of all deaths. Of these, 37% are premature deaths affecting those between the ages of 30 and 69. NCDs disproportionately affect people in low- and middle-income countries, where more than 75% of global NCD deaths, and 85% of premature deaths, occur.  Against this backdrop, Sanofi Global Health is launching a multi-country, multi-year partnership with Medtronic Labs to expand access to healthcare for underserved patients living with diabetes and hypertension. This partnership will leverage digital health and a community-based approach to improve disease awareness, diagnosis, and management of diabetes and hypertension. The first phase will focus on Tanzania and Sierra Leone where it aims to reach more than 75,000 beneficiaries in strong collaboration with health system partners. This partnership aims to build a replicable and sustainable approach to community-focused chronic disease management while contributing to strengthening health systems as they build towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Sanofi Global Health has teamed up with Medtronic Labs to address the pressing challenge of non-communicable diseases in LMICs3.  Status on our renewed CSR ambition In 2020, in the context of defining our renewed CSR ambitions we reviewed and updated our portfolio of initiatives. Numbers shown for 2021 below serve as the baseline to highlight our ongoing progress in the implementation of Sanofi’s CSR strategy.  Affordable access Sanofi Global Health, a nonprofit unit formed within the company in April 2021, aims to provide 30 of Sanofi's medicines across a wide range of therapeutic areas to patients in 40 of the lowest income countries. Beyond the products provided, Sanofi Global Health will also focus on integrated programs that ensure optimal care management over time for patients.  Sanofi is also committed to helping 1,000 patients living with rare diseases who have no access to treatments and will donate 100,000 vials of medicine for their treatments each year. This continues Sanofi’s 30-year commitment to patients suffering from rare diseases, such as Fabry, Gaucher or Pompe diseases, for which access to treatment is often limited.  Our third initiative on access is to develop a global access plan for all new products, making them available in selected relevant markets within two years of launch.

Sanofi is the only company leveraging its worldwide manufacturing capacity and expertise for the supply of three different authorized COVID-19 vaccines from BioNTech / Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson. Manufacturing teams on three industrial sites of the company in France, Germany and the U.S. are mobilized, with 100 million doses released by end December 2021.  At the same time, Sanofi continues its efforts in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic with its adjuvanted recombinant protein candidate vaccine, developed in partnership with GSK. Positive preliminary booster data have shown that neutralizing antibodies increased across all primary vaccines received (mRNA or adenovirus) for all age groups tested, with a good safety and tolerability profile. Phase 3 trial continues to accrue number of events needed for analysis as populations around the world are increasingly exposed to COVID-19 variants; results are expected in Q1 2022. Sanofi intends to file booster data with regulatory authorities following the Phase 3 results. Fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial results Business Net Income4 In the fourth quarter of 2021, Sanofi generated net sales of €9,994 million, an increase of 6.5% (up 4.1% at CER). In 2021, net sales were €37,761 million up 4.8% (up 7.1% at CER). Fourth-quarter other revenues increased 18.9% (up 15.5% at CER) to €421 million, including decreased VaxServe sales of non-Sanofi products of €288 million (down -10.4 % at CER). In 2021, other revenues increased 6.5% (up 10.1% at CER) to €1,414 million, including VaxServe sales of non-Sanofi products of €1,078 million (down -2.2 % at CER). Fourth-quarter Gross Profit increased 10.3% (up 7.5% at CER) to €6,944 million. The gross margin ratio increased 2.4 percentage points to 69.5% versus the fourth quarter of 2020, reflecting strong improvement of the Pharmaceuticals gross margin ratio (which increased from 70.9% to 75.4%) driven by favorable impact of growing weight of Specialty Care and efficiency gains in Industrial Affairs. The Vaccines gross margin ratio decreased to 56.0% from 60.7%, reflecting lower sales of U.S. influenza vaccines and inventory destruction associated to this lower demand. CHC gross margin ratio was 62.5%, down 1.5 percentage points. In 2021, the gross margin ratio increased 1.2 percentage point to 71.3% (71.4% at CER) driven by Specialty Care and efficiency gains in industrial affairs.  Research and Development (R&D) expenses increased 4.6% (up 2.8% at CER) to €1,585 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting increase in priority assets development as well as recent acquisitions partly offset by efficiencies. In 2021, R&D expenses increased 2.9% to €5,692 million and were up 4.3% at CER driven by increased investment behind key assets and additional R&D expenses from recent acquisitions which were partly offset by efficiency and the benefits of terminating diabetes and cardiovascular related projects recorded in 2020.  Fourth-quarter selling general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 6.0% to €2,758 million. At CER, SG&A expenses were up 3.9%, reflecting increased commercial investments in Specialty Care growth drivers which were partially offset by continued streamlining of General and Administrative expenses (G&A). In the fourth quarter, the ratio of SG&A to sales decreased 0.1 percentage point to 27.6% compared to the prior year. In 2021, SG&A expenses increased 1.7% to €9,555 million (up 3.7% at CER). In 2021, ratio of SG&A to sales was 0.8 percentage point lower at 25.3% compared to 2020. Fourth-quarter operating expenses were €4,343 million, an increase of 5.5% and 3.5% at CER. In 2021 operating expenses were €15,247 million, an increase of 2.2% and an increase of 3.9% at CER. Fourth-quarter other current operating income net of expenses was -€356 million versus -€123 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Other current operating income net of expenses included an expense of €444 million (versus an expense of €290 million in the fourth quarter of 2020) corresponding to the share of profit to Regeneron of the monoclonal antibodies Alliance, reimbursement of development costs by Regeneron and the reimbursement of commercialization-related expenses incurred by Regeneron. In the fourth quarter, this line also included €61 million of net capital gains related to General medicines and CHC portfolio streamlining compared to €72 million in the same period of 2020. In 2021, other current operating income net of expenses was -€946 million versus -€561 million in 2020 and included €318 million of net capital gains related to portfolio streamlining compared to €211 million in 2020. The full-year 2021 expense associated with the monoclonal antibodies Alliance with Regeneron was €1,429 million, which compared with an expense of €1,001 million in 2020 (see appendix 7 for further details). The share of profit from associates was €18 million versus €4 million in Q4 2020 and included the share of U.S profit related to VaxelisTM.  Fourth-quarter business operating income4 (BOI) increased 9.9% to €2,256 million. At CER, BOI increased 6.9%. The ratio of BOI to net sales increased 0.7 percentage points to 22.6% mainly reflecting gross margin ratio improvement. In 2021, business operating income was €10,714 million, up 9.8% (up 13.3% at CER). In 2021, €730 million of savings were generated and fully reinvested in growth drivers and key programs in R&D. In 2021 the ratio of business operating income to net sales increased 1.3 percentage points to 28.4% (28.6% at CER). Net financial expenses were €83 million and €328 million in the fourth quarter and full-year 2021 (versus €93 million and 335 million in the same periods of 2020).  Fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 effective tax rate was 20.5% and 20.9% versus 22% in the prior year. Sanofi expects its effective tax rate to be around 19% in 2022. Fourth-quarter business net income4 increased 13.3% to €1,730 million and increased 10.2% at CER. The ratio of business net income to net sales increased 1.0 percentage points to 17.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. In 2021, business net income increased 11.8% to €8,213 million and increased 15.5% at CER. The ratio of business net income to net sales increased 1.3 percentage points to 21.7% versus 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2021, business earnings per share4 (EPS) was €1.38, up 13.1% on a reported basis (up 9.8% at CER). The average number of shares outstanding was 1,254.9 million versus 1,255.1 million in fourth quarter 2020. In 2021, business earnings per share8 was €6.56, up 11.9% on a reported basis and up 15.5% at CER. The average number of shares outstanding was 1,252.5 million in 2021 versus 1,253.6 million in 2020. Reconciliation of IFRS net income reported to business net income (see Appendix 4)  In 2021, the IFRS net income was €6,223 million. The main items excluded from the business net income were: An amortization charge of €1,580 million related to fair value remeasurement on intangible assets of acquired companies (primarily Genzyme: €509 million, Bioverativ: €320 million, Boehringer Ingelheim CHC business: €195 million and Ablynx: €168 million) and to acquired intangible assets (licenses/products: €96 million). These items have no cash impact on the Company.An impairment of intangible assets of €192 million mainly related to sutimlimab (termination of ITP) and discontinuation of some vaccines R&D projects.Restructuring costs and similar items of €820 million related to streamlining initiatives.A €614 million tax effect arising from the items listed above, mainly comprising €415 million of deferred taxes generated by amortization and impairments of intangible assets and €200 million associated with restructuring costs and similar items (see Appendix 4). Capital Allocation In 2021, free cash flow before restructuring, acquisitions and disposals increased by 32.6% to €9,977 million, after net changes in working capital (+€1,475 million) and capital expenditures (-€1,400 million).

Following the Regeneron shares transaction that was completed on May 29, 2020, the definition of the non-GAAP financial measure “Business net income” has been revised such that Share of profit/(loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method excludes the effects of applying the equity method to the investment in Regeneron. The comparative periods of 2019 presented have been restated to reflect that adjustment. Business net income is defined as net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi excluding: amortization of intangible assets,impairment of intangible assets, fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration related to business combinations or to disposals,other impacts associated with acquisitions (including impacts of acquisitions on associates and joint ventures),restructuring costs and similar items(1),other gains and losses (including gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets(1)),costs or provisions associated with litigation(1),gain on Regeneron investment as a result of the transaction completed on May 29, 2020 (the amount does not include the gain related to the remeasurement at fair value at this date of the 400,000 retained shares),tax effects related to the items listed above as well as effects of major tax disputes,effect of equity method accounting for Regeneron investment  (excluded from Business net income as a consequence of the sale of the entire equity investment in Regeneron (with the exception of 400,000 shares retained by Sanofi) on May 29th 2020,net income attributable to non-controlling interests related to the items listed above.

Free Cash Flow is determined from the Business Net Income adjusted for depreciation, amortization and impairment, share of profit/loss in associates and joint ventures net of dividends received, gains & losses on disposals, net change in provisions including pensions and other post-employment benefits, deferred taxes, share-based expense and other non-cash items.

Download the PDF versionSanofi unveils new corporate brand and logo – unites the company under one purpose and a single identity Paris, February 3, 2022. Sanofi today unveiled a new bold and unifying corporate brand that supports the modernization and transformation the company launched in December 2019. Over the last 50 years, Sanofi has grown into a diverse, global healthcare leader, with a rich heritage of patient-centric scientific discovery. This history includes the first treatments for many rare diseases and the establishment of standards of care in diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Sanofi’s commitment to public health has helped protect hundreds of millions of people from influenza every year for decades and pushed polio to the brink of eradication, while its scientific vision has led to breakthrough innovations in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.  With roots in a variety of diverse companies, Sanofi is today the combination of many cultures, identities, and brands. Its new brand is rooted in this heritage and brings this diverse history together in a single common identity for the first time. This manifestation of the company’s journey highlights an ambitious strategy for the future. Paul HudsonCEO of Sanofi“As we approach the half century mark of our company’s existence, we have undertaken the most important transformation and modernization in our history,” said Paul Hudson, CEO of Sanofi. “In 2019, we launched our Play to Win strategy, which focuses on applying our platform for innovation to produce first- and best-in-class treatments and vaccines. Our new brand is a natural and important next step in this journey and represents the integrated way in which the company will work to achieve our shared ambition to transform the practice of medicine.” One Sanofi, one identity Current business units Sanofi Pasteur and Sanofi Genzyme, focused on vaccines and specialty care respectively, and all other acquired brands, will be united under the singular Sanofi name and brand. These brands have for years symbolized the impact that innovation can have on people’s lives. Thinking, acting, and behaving as a single entity under a new shared purpose and identity will position Sanofi to have greater impact by more strategically applying the resources that exist across the company to drive innovations that matter. A design rooted in scientific discovery The new logo is a representation of Sanofi’s new purpose and ambition, which is inspired by the simple and motion-oriented codes of the tech industry. The two purple dots embody the scientific journey between a starting point – the curiosity of questioning the status-quo and wondering “what if?” – and a finish line – the eureka moment where innovative solutions are unlocked to impact people’s lives.    Josep CatllàHead of Corporate Affairs at Sanofi“With our new brand, we have sought to provide our people, our partners, patients and healthcare professionals with a clear and strong understanding of who we are and what we are set to achieve,” said Josep Catllà, Head of Corporate Affairs at Sanofi. “Sanofi’s attitude is humble, authentic—and a little bit unconventional too. We believe that our new brand and logo carve out a unique space in the healthcare industry that perfectly represents our new purpose to chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.” For more information on our purpose and our identity, you can visit our dedicated page.

Dupixent is not an immunosuppressant and does not require lab monitoring. IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis, asthma and CRSwNP. Dupixent is currently approved in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, as well as certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is also approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world and more than 350,000 patients have been treated globally.  Dupilumab Development Program Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation. In addition to the currently approved indications, Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes, including pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age, Phase 3), eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3), prurigo nodularis (Phase 3), chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3), chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3), bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3), chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3), allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2).

Download the PDF versionCHMP recommends approval of Dupixent® (dupilumab) for children aged 6 to 11 years with severe asthma with type 2 inflammation Recommendation based on pivotal trial that showed Dupixent significantly reduced severe asthma attacks and improved lung function in children aged 6 to 11Dupixent is the only biologic to show improved lung function in a randomized Phase 3 trial for children aged 6 to 11Data further reinforce well-established safety profile of Dupixent PARIS and TARRYTOWN, N.Y. – January 31, 2022 - The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion recommending to extend the approval of Dupixent® (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) to include add-on maintenance treatment for children aged 6 to 11 years with severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) who are inadequately controlled on two maintenance therapies. The European Commission is expected to announce a final decision on the Dupixent application in the coming months. The CHMP positive opinion is supported by Phase 3 data recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine showing that Dupixent added to standard of care significantly reduced the rate of severe asthma attacks and rapidly improved lung function within two weeks, with sustained improvement up to 52 weeks, in children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. The safety results from the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included injection site reactions, viral upper respiratory tract infections and eosinophilia. Helminth infections were also more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo in patients aged 6 to11 years. Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. Up to 85% of children with asthma may have type 2 inflammation and are more likely to have higher disease burden. Despite treatment with current standard-of-care inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and bronchodilators, these children may continue to experience serious symptoms such as coughing, wheezing and difficulty breathing. Severe asthma may impact children's developing airways and cause potentially life-threatening exacerbations. Children with severe asthma also may require the use of multiple courses of systemic corticosteroids that carry significant risks. Uncontrolled severe asthma can interfere with day-to-day activities, like sleeping, attending school and playing sports. On October 20, 2021, Dupixent was approved by the FDA as an add-on maintenance treatment for patients aged 6 to 11 years with moderate-to-severe asthma characterized by an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma. The use of Dupixent in children aged 6 to 11 years with uncontrolled severe asthma is investigational in the EU and is not yet approved. About Dupixent  Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). Dupixent is currently approved in Europe for adults and adolescents 12 years and older as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised FeNO, who are inadequately controlled with high-dose ICS plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment. It is also approved in the U.S., Japan and other countries around the world for use in certain patients with asthma, specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis as well as CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is also approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world, and more than 350,000 patients have been treated globally. Dupilumab Development Program Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation. In addition to the currently approved indications, Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3), pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age, Phase 3), eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3), bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3), prurigo nodularis (Phase 3), chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3), chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3), chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3), allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2).

Download the PDF versionSanofi and Regeneron provide regulatory update on Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc) in advanced cervical cancer January 28, 2022 Sanofi and Regeneron today announced the voluntary withdrawal of the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc) as a second-line treatment for patients with advanced cervical cancer. The decision was made after the companies and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were not able to align on certain post-marketing studies. Discussions with regulatory authorities outside of the U.S. are ongoing. About Cervical Cancer It is estimated that approximately 570,000 people are diagnosed with cervical cancer worldwide each year, with deaths exceeding 250,000. In the U.S. there are 14,500 new cases diagnosed annually and approximately 4,000 die each year. Since we filed our sBLA, another PD-1 inhibitor was approved as first-line treatment for patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical tumors that express PD-L1. The use of Libtayo in advanced cervical cancer is not approved by the FDA. About Libtayo Libtayo is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 on T-cells. By binding to PD-1, Libtayo has been shown to block cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation. Libtayo is indicated in certain patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC), advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), and advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The extensive clinical program for Libtayo is focused on difficult-to-treat cancers. Libtayo is currently being investigated in trials as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with either conventional or novel therapeutic approaches for other solid tumors and blood cancers. These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

Download the PDF versionSecond positive Phase 3 Dupixent® (dupilumab) trial confirms significant improvements for patients with prurigo nodularis Dupixent is the first and only medicine to demonstrate positive Phase 3 results in prurigo nodularis, confirming the potential benefit of targeting IL-4 and IL-13, central drivers of type 2 inflammation, to address itch and skin lesionsData confirm results from first Phase 3 trial, with 60% of Dupixent patients meeting the primary endpoint of itch reduction compared to 18% of placebo at 24 weeksAdditionally, nearly three times as many Dupixent patients experienced reduced skin lesionsData continue to support well-established safety profile of Dupixent Data to be submitted to regulatory authorities starting in H1 PARIS and TARRYTOWN, N.Y. – January 19, 2022 – A second Phase 3 trial evaluating Dupixent® (dupilumab) in adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis, a chronic type 2 inflammatory skin disease, met its primary and key secondary endpoints, showing it significantly reduced itch and skin lesions compared to placebo at 24 weeks in this investigational setting. The data confirm the positive results that were previously reported from the Phase 3 PRIME2 trial and will be submitted to regulatory authorities around the world starting in the first half of this year. The impact of prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch. “These results strengthen our understanding of the underlying biology of prurigo nodularis and are encouraging as we seek to help patients severely impacted by symptoms like unbearable itch, skin lesions, stinging and burning,” says Naimish Patel, M.D, Head of Global Development, Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. “We are committed to researching the science behind type 2 inflammation to advance and shift perceptions in a number of inflammatory skin diseases that are not well-understood. The decision to accelerate directly into a Phase 3 clinical trial for prurigo nodularis was driven by our conviction that type 2 inflammation is a key driver of this highly pruritic disease and underscores our commitment to quickly bring novel treatments to patients who are in urgent need of new options.”   People with prurigo nodularis can experience intense, persistent itch, with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. It is often described as painful with burning, stinging and tingling of the skin. The disease can also negatively affect mental health, activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term. There are approximately 75,000 people in the U.S. who are unable to control their disease with topical steroids and otherwise do not have an approved treatment option. “Prurigo nodularis is a highly burdensome disease involving dozens, if not hundreds of incessantly itchy and burning skin lesions, and the potential for complications such as skin infections,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. “The results of this trial once again show that Dupixent is able to significantly address the hallmark symptoms of this disease while maintaining a consistent safety profile, including a numerically lower rate of skin infections. We are encouraged by the progress of our extensive Dupixent development program that continually reinforces IL-4 and IL-13 as key drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying a number of diseases, including dermatological diseases such as prurigo nodularis and atopic dermatitis, respiratory diseases such as asthma and CRSwNP, and gastrointestinal diseases such as eosinophilic esophagitis.” In the Phase 3 PRIME trial, topline results comparing Dupixent (n=75) to placebo (n=76) showed at week 24: More than three times as many Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline, the primary endpoint: 60% of Dupixent patients compared to 18% of placebo patients (p <0.0001).Nearly three times as many Dupixent patients achieved clear or almost clear skin, a secondary endpoint: 48% of Dupixent patients compared to 18% of placebo patients (p= 0.0004).Dupixent patients experienced significantly greater improvements in measures of overall health-related quality of life, skin pain, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. The safety results of the trial were consistent what was observed in PRIME2 and were also generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. For the 24-week treatment period, overall rates of treatment-emergent adverse events were 71% for Dupixent and 63% for placebo. Adverse events most commonly observed with Dupixent included nasopharyngitis (5% Dupixent, 4% placebo) and headache (5% Dupixent, 5% placebo). Additionally, 0% of Dupixent patients and 4% of placebo patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events prior to week 24. Consistent with published literature for the atopic dermatitis trials, numerically lower rates of skin infections were seen with Dupixent in this trial (4% Dupixent, 9% placebo). Detailed results from this trial will be presented at an upcoming medical congress. The potential use of Dupixent in prurigo nodularis is currently under clinical development and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. About the Trial  PRIME, part of the LIBERTY-PN PRIME clinical program, is a randomized, Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 151 adults with prurigo nodularis inadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or with whom those therapies were not advisable. During the 24-week treatment period, patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks with or without topical treatments (low- or medium-dose topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors were continued if patients were using these treatments at randomization).  The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at 24 weeks (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale WI-NRS of 0-10). A key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin at 24 weeks (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage IGA PN-S 0-4 scale).  About Dupixent Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). Dupixent is currently approved in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, as well as certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is also approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world, and more than 350,000 patients have been treated globally.  Dupilumab Development Program Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation. In addition to the currently approved indications, Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes, including prurigo nodularis (Phase 3), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3), pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age (Phase 3), eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3), bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3), chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3), chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3), chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3), allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.

Download the PDF versionExscientia and Sanofi establish strategic research collaboration to develop AI-driven pipeline of precision-engineered medicines Collaborative efforts aim to accelerate drug discovery and improve clinical successAgreement to utilize Exscientia’s AI-based capabilities and personalised medicine platform from target identification through patient selectionResearch will be focused on up to 15 novel small molecule candidates across oncology and immunologyExscientia will receive an upfront cash payment of $100 million with the potential of $5.2 billion in total milestones plus tiered royalties PARIS, OXFORD, and BOSTON – January 7, 2022 – Sanofi and Exscientia announced today a groundbreaking research collaboration and license agreement to develop up to 15 novel small molecule candidates across oncology and immunology, leveraging Exscientia’s end-to-end AI-driven platform utilizing actual patient samples. The companies have been working together since 2016 and in 2019, Sanofi in-licensed Exscientia’s novel bispecific small molecule candidate capable of targeting two distinct targets in inflammation and immunology. “We look forward to deepening our work with Exscientia, a leader in leveraging AI to modernize all aspects of drug discovery and development,” said Frank Nestle, Global Head of Research and Chief Scientific Officer, Sanofi. “Sanofi’s collaboration with Exscientia aims to transform how we discover and develop new small molecule medicines for cancer and immune-mediated diseases. Application of sophisticated AI and machine learning methods will not only shorten drug discovery timelines, but will also help to design higher quality and better targeted medicines for patients.” Exscientia and Sanofi will collaborate to identify and select target projects, leveraging Exscientia’s personalised medicine platform. The platform enables a “patient-first” approach through integrating primary human tissue samples into early target and drug discovery research. By doing so, Exscientia scientists can integrate patient, disease, and clinically relevant data into decisions on potential new medicine candidates earlier in the drug creation process. In addition to target discovery, Exscientia will lead small molecule drug design and lead optimization activities up to development candidate nomination, with Sanofi assuming responsibility for preclinical and clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization. “It is immensely exciting to collaborate with Sanofi with our goal of realizing the full potential of AI to deliver the next generation of cancer and immunology medicines,” said Andrew Hopkins, DPhil, CEO and founder of Exscientia. “Our AI-driven platform can be leveraged across drug discovery, translational research and development, with applications ranging from improving the precision medicine and quality of drug candidates to enriching for patient selection in clinical trials. Our expanded collaboration with Sanofi will utilise the breadth of our platform to test AI-designed drug candidates against patient tissue models, potentially providing far better accuracy than conventional approaches such as mouse models. When you consider the change this represents – testing candidates against actual human tissue years before a clinical trial – it’s transformative.” Under the terms of the agreement, Exscientia will receive an upfront cash payment of $100 million from Sanofi and will be eligible to receive future research, translational, clinical development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to approximately $5.2 billion in aggregate, if all milestones for all programs are achieved. In the case that Sanofi commercializes a therapeutic from the collaboration, Exscientia will also be eligible to receive tiered royalties on product sales ranging from high-single-digits to mid-teens and an option for clinical co-investment to increase the royalty rate up to 21% on net sales of co-funded products. The upfront cash payment of $100 million is expected to be reflected in the first quarter 2022 financial results of Exscientia as cash inflows from collaborations and recognized as revenue over the duration of the agreement.  About Exscientia Exscientia is an AI-driven pharmatech company committed to discovering, designing and developing the best possible drugs in the fastest and most effective manner. Exscientia developed the first-ever functional precision oncology platform to successfully guide treatment selection and improve patient outcomes in a prospective interventional clinical study, as well as to progress AI-designed small molecules into the clinical setting.

Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts. These statements include projections and estimates and their underlying assumptions, statements regarding plans, objectives, intentions and expectations with respect to future financial results, events, operations, services, product development and potential, and statements regarding future performance. Forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words “expects”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “intends”, “estimates”, “plans” and similar expressions. Although Sanofi’s management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, investors are cautioned that forward-looking information and statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Sanofi, that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. These risks and uncertainties include among other things, the uncertainties inherent in research and development, future clinical data and analysis, including post marketing, decisions by regulatory authorities, such as the FDA or the EMA, regarding whether and when to approve any drug, device or biological application that may be filed for any such product candidates as well as their decisions regarding labelling and other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of such product candidates, the fact that product candidates if approved may not be commercially successful, the future approval and commercial success of therapeutic alternatives, Sanofi’s ability to benefit from external growth opportunities, to complete related transactions and/or obtain regulatory clearances, risks associated with intellectual property and any related pending or future litigation and the ultimate outcome of such litigation, trends in exchange rates and prevailing interest rates, volatile economic and market conditions, cost containment initiatives and subsequent changes thereto, and the impact that COVID-19 will have on us, our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, and the financial condition of any one of them, as well as on our employees and on the global economy as a whole. Any material effect of COVID-19 on any of the foregoing could also adversely impact us. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise of which we are not currently aware and may exacerbate other previously identified risks. The risks and uncertainties also include the uncertainties discussed or identified in the public filings with the SEC and the AMF made by Sanofi, including those listed under “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Sanofi’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2020. Other than as required by applicable law, Sanofi does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information or statements.
