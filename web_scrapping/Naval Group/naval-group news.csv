With the integration of the CSR strategy into the  group’s Strategic Plan, the Naval Group Executive Committee  and I wanted to do everything possible to help the company  progress towards ever more responsible behavior. The Corporate  Social Responsibility (CSR) Department , which we strengthened  in October 2020, is responsible for the deployment of this  strategy, which is broken down into twenty projects spread over  four pillars. This report provides an overview of their progress  throughout the year.  One of our challenges for 2022 will be to move up a gear so that  the results of these CSR projects can be multiplied.  We will also be adopting our purpose, following the collaborative  work undertaken in 2021 with groups of volunteers at all our sites  and in two subsidiaries.  Today, CSR is more than an asset: it has become an absolutely  vital condition. It is no longer just a question of complying  with current and future legislation, we need to anticipate the  expectations of our stakeholders and integrate this way of  being responsible, as required by CSR, into all of our decisions,  with a view to contributing to the long-term performance of  Naval Group.  All of our employees, suppliers, partners, shareholders and  customers must get on board for Naval Group’s actions to be  effective.  By being exemplary in terms of CSR, we will gain competitive  advantages for the future and attract new talent. To convince  young people to join our teams, or partners to work with us, we  must prove to them that we are doing everything we can to have  a positive impact on society and the environment.  This will be my wish for the future: let’s commit, together, to  being both efficient and responsible!”  I  I  I  1 2 0 2 T R O P E R Y T L B S N O P S E R L A C O S E T A R O P R O C  I  P U O R G L A V A N  1            I. Naval Group: a global player  in naval defence  I.1.  400 YEARS OF NAVAL HISTORY AT THE SERVICE OF THE FRENCH NAVY  1631  1751  1778  1899  First arsenals created   Navy cannon foundry   The Lorient arsenal succeeds   Launch of Le Narval   by Cardinal Richelieu  in Angoulême-Ruelle  the Compagnie des Indes  in Cherbourg, the ancestor   of the modern submarine  I  I  I  1 2 0 2 T R O P E R Y T L B S N O P S E R L A C O S E T A R O P R O C  I  P U O R G L A V A N  2  1967  1996  1997  2001  Launch of Redoutable,   Entry into service of the   Entry into active service of   Entry into active service of the   the first Sub-Surface   La Fayette-class stealth frigates  the ballistic missile submarine   aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle  Ballistic Nuclear, SSBN  (SSBN) Le Triomphant  2003  2017  DCN becomes a state-owned   DCNS becomes Naval Group  private limited company  2020  2021  Launch of the Suffren, the   Launch of the third-generation   first Barracuda-class Ship   SSBN program (3G SSBN )  Submersible Nuclear (SSN)            I. Naval Group: a global player in naval defence   I.2.

Naval Group  develops innovative solutions to meet the needs of navies.  Present throughout the life cycle of vessels, it designs, builds,  integrates and maintains submarines and surface vessels, as  well as their systems and equipment, until dismantling. It also  provides services for shipyards and naval bases. A high-tech  industrialist, it relies on its exceptional expertise, its unique  design and production resources and its ability to forge strategic  partnerships, particularly in the context of technology transfers.  Attentive to corporate social responsibility issues, Naval Group is  a member of the United Nations Global Compact. Established on  five continents, the group generates revenue of €4.1 billion and  has 17,373 employees.  In a world of increasing economic and political instability,  Naval Group has defined a clear strategic vision to meet the  sovereignty requirements of its customer navies and ensure the  sustainability of its growth.  The group pursues an active and proactive policy in terms of  innovation, respect for human rights, diversity and the fight  against corruption and is committed to reducing its environmental  footprint.  Located in numerous employment areas in France and abroad,  the group relies on a network of responsible suppliers and  partners and strives to provide its customers with the best  possible services and products.  I.3.  NAVAL GROUP’S MISSIONS:   DEFENCE, A SUSTAINABLE ACTIVITY  As a French naval defence manufacturer,  Naval Group contributes to ensuring the  sovereignty of the countries – primarily  France – to which it delivers its products and  services.  In a globalised  and increasingly   unpredictable world, nations are faced with emerging and  multiple threats. The combination of military capabilities,  diplomacy and development support is necessary to ensure  stability, prevent conflict and resolve disputes in a non-violent  manner.  Naval Group helps France’s partner countries address the  threats they face. Its products are used to ensure the stability  of international waters, to support rescue missions at sea and to  fight against traffic at sea and even, in exceptional periods such  as during the pandemic, for health missions (on-board hospitals,  transportation of patients).

As a voluntary commitment framework, an  international reference framework, and a   platform for action and discussion, the Global Compact is the  largest global social responsibility initiative, with more than  19,000 participants in 170 countries.  THE TEN PRINCIPLES OF THE UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT  HUMAN RIGHTS  1  2  Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed  human rights.  Businesses should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.  INTERNATIONAL LABOUR STANDARDS  Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition  of the right to collective bargaining.  Businesses should contribute to the elimination of all forms of forced  and compulsory labour.  Businesses should contribute to the effective abolition of child labour.  Businesses should contribute to the elimination of discrimination in respect of  employment and occupation.  Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges.  Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental  responsibility.  Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally  friendly technologies.  3  4  5  6  ENVIRONMENT  7  8  9  ANTI-CORRUPTION  10  Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion  and bribery.            III. A strong commitment to the United Nations Global Compact  By becoming a member of the Global Compact in 2014,  Naval Group is committed to integrating these ten principles  into its strategy and operations over the long term, to promoting  them in its sphere of influence, to communicating publicly on  the progress made and to involving the highest level of its   organisation  in this process. Its performance and progress are  assessed annually.  Naval Group mainly supports, through its activities and actions,  five of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by  the UN in 2015 – goals 5, 9, 13, 14 and 16.  In June 2021, for the seventh consecutive year, Naval Group  achieved Advanced level, the highest degree of distinction  conferred – only 5% of member businesses have achieved this  level. This renewal confirms the group’s desire to promote the  ten principles of the Global Compact and make a sustainable  contribution to their SDGs.  NB: a large number of actions carried out by Naval Group  contribute to SDGs other than the five priority objectives. They  will also be indicated by an icon in the remainder of this report.

DEPLOYMENT OF THE CSR STRATEGY  IV.2.  STRENGTHENING THE CSR GOVERNANCE  In order to strengthen the CSR culture and its place in the group’s  governance, the group’s Executive Committee has introduced  measures to accelerate progress on sustainable development  issues. Examples include: • in September 2020, the adoption by the group’s Executive  Committee of a more ambitious CSR policy integrated into  the group’s Strategic Plan. The CSR strategy is broken down  into 20 projects spread over four pillars: governance, social  commitment, environmental protection and environmental  resilience, responsible industrial partner. Each pillar is  sponsored by a member of the Executive Committee and each  CSR project is managed by a person specialising  in the topic  concerned;  • the management of the CSR strategy is carried out directly by   the Executive Committee on a half-yearly basis;  • transformative CSR projects are included in the Naval 2025   transformation program;  • the CSR Department  reports directly to the group’s General  Secretary, who is a member of the Executive Committee;  • in 2022, Naval Group aims to adopt a corporate purpose (raison  d'être) in order to reinforce the meaning of its activity to all its  stakeholders and in particular its employees.  The CSR Department  guides the company’s staff towards a  sustainable transformation through the sharing of responsible  behavior.  The CSR Department  oversees the CSR strategy; its role is to: • support the sponsors and leaders of CSR projects, in particular:  help with structuring, coordination of cross-functional actions,  facilitate interactions between entities;  • ensure the overall consistency of the strategy; • monitor the progress of CSR projects, in particular via half-  yearly reports to the Executive Committee;  • at Executive Committee meetings, organise  detailed   presentations of CSR projects;  • encourage employee involvement in the CSR approach through   training and communication actions.  The CSR Department  also manages the vigilance plan, the  statement of non-financial performance and the CSR report.  The CSR Department  relies on a network of on-site CSR managers.  It holds monthly meetings with them. The on-site CSR manager  promotes the CSR culture at their site, shares the CSR actions  of their site with all CSR managers and coordinates and/or  contributes to local action.  “While the CSR approach has been followed by  Naval Group for many years, the company wanted  to reaﬃ  rm its ambition, to show that CSR is at  the heart of its managers’ concerns and that it  is committed to anticipating and satisfying the  expectations of its stakeholders in this area.”  Juliette Muyl, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)  Director at Naval Group  The CSR strategy is based on the seven themes  of international standard ISO 26000, which  deﬁ nes social responsibility as the responsibility  of an organisation  with regard to the impacts  of its decisions and activities on society and the  environment.  It is reﬂ ected in ethical and transparent behavior  that must be integrated throughout the  organisation  and implemented in its relationships.  The strengthening of governance and  communication on the actions implemented also  serve to boost the visibility of CSR: the objective is  to bring together as many employees as possible  around its challenges.  The proﬁ t-sharing agreement signed in June 2021  also reﬂ ects the desire to involve each employee in  the collective performance of the group. It is based  on targeted criteria, adapted from the Naval 2025  transformation program and includes operational  objectives that are directly linked to CSR objectives:  CLMS, customer satisfaction, carbon trajectory and  skills maintenance.  “CSR is not a project but a way of living to be  integrated into all of the company’s practices.  Everyone needs to take action!”  Juliette Muyl, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)  Director at Naval Group            IV. Pillar I: Governance  IV.3.  DEFINITION OF NAVAL GROUP’S RAISON   D'ÊTRE  PROMOTING THE SUSTAINABLE ROLE OF THE COMPANY IN  SOCIETY  France’s action plan for business growth and transformation ,  known as the Pacte Law (2019), allows companies wishing to  adopt a raison d'être to do so.  The raison d'être represents a general interest ambition that the  managers intend to pursue, “consisting of the principles that  (the company) has adopted and for which it intends to allocate  resources in the performance of its activity”.  Naval Group took this opportunity to explain to its stakeholders,  as well as to society as a whole, its contribution to the general  interest, its usefulness and the meaning of its action.  In this context, one of the projects of the governance pillar for  the year 2022 is to define Naval Group’s raison d'être.  This project is managed by the General Secretary via a project  team composed of the CSR Director, the Director of Management  and Transformation within the Human Resources Department   and  the Director of the Enterprise unit within the Communications  Department . Its methodology and timetable have been approved  by the Executive Committee.  A COLLECTIVE AMBITION  Sixteen working groups were set up from a panel of employees  representative of the company’s diversity: all sites as well as two  subsidiaries were consulted – those in Singapore and Egypt – and  an ad hoc committee from the Central Economic and Social  Committee (CSEC) was created specifically for this exercise.  These groups, i.e. around 250 employees, were consulted twice,  with a view to proposing answers to the following question:  “What is Naval Group’s contribution to society?” This question  was also asked to more than 300 company managers at an  internal seminar to supplement the research. The objective is to  adopt a raison d'être in 2022.  “Today, the defence sector is not unanimous, and the merits of our activities  are not obvious to everyone. Adopting a raison d'être will strengthen the  meaning of our activity for all our stakeholders, and our teams in particular.  This project is an opportunity to engage our employees in how we can best serve  our customers. It is also an opportunity to strengthen our cohesion, in line with  the Forward commitment approach.”  Pierre Éric Pommellet, Chairman and Chief Executive Oﬃ    cer of Naval Group  IV.4.  CONTRIBUTION AND CONSIDERATION   OF STAKEHOLDERS  The attention paid to the various points of view of the group’s  ecosystem is a differentiating factor and is a key element of the  group’s attractiveness and the involvement of its employees.  Naval Group wishes to identify and classify issues in a  collaborative and collective manner.  By fostering a culture of dialogue and partnership with and  listening to each stakeholder, the group increases its ability to  understand their expectations, to anticipate them and to seize  opportunities.  Consulting stakeholders on a given CSR issue also encourages  them to take ownership of the issue and contributes to their  individual approach to continuous improvement.  Supporting the company’s transformation  This is the goal of the Forward commitment  approach, launched in 2019 and reiterated for  its third edition in March 2021. It consists of  oﬀ ering employees the opportunity to identify  and implement action to improve their working  conditions and environment.  69% of staﬀ  expressed their opinions during the  2021 survey. By listening to managers and the  discussions that take place at all times, a culture of  dialogue and initiative is being developed within the  teams at the same time as managerial practices  conducive to team engagement. Team-based  exchanges and participation in the company’s  transformation also facilitate the onboarding of  new recruits – in 2021, one third of the group’s  employees had been with the company for less  than ﬁ ve years.

This shows  a real awareness of corporate social responsibility issues.  The contribution of the Innovative Generation Committee  Cogite )  In 2021, special attention was paid to the voice of the group’s  young employees, through discussions conducted by the  Innovative Generation Committees (Cogite ). These committees  are made up of a young population representative of the sites,  and their duties are to provide a fresh perspective and to  report their findings to the local Executive Committee (Codir )  to advance practices and organisation with regard to the pillars  of the Naval 2025 transformation program: Growth, Innovation,  Talent and Performance.  In 2021, the Cogites  took part in a survey on the issues listed  in the materiality matrix. The responses led to a consensus on  the positive aspect of the integration of the CSR strategy into  the group’s strategic plan. The survey also revealed that the  members of the Cogites  attach particularly high importance to  the themes of respect for human rights, working relationships  and conditions, customer satisfaction and environmental  protection.  They were also called upon during discussions on the  company’s  raison d'être, for instance through working groups  at  the Cherbourg and Saint-Tropez sites, made up of members  of  the Cogite  and site volunteers.

ANTI-CORRUPTION AND INFLUENCE   PEDDLING  Naval Group applies a principle of zero tolerance to corruption  and influence peddling.  THE ANTI-CORRUPTION AND INFLUENCE PEDDLING SYSTEM  In accordance with the provisions of the  Sapin II Law on “transparency, the fight  against corruption and the modernisation of  the economy”, and the provisions of  agreements and foreign laws applicable to its  activity, Naval Group implements a system  aimed at preventing and detecting any   corruption or influence peddling.  The Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer commits  Naval Group to the fight against corruption and influence  peddling through a robust system, based on a culture of integrity  and a principle of zero tolerance.  In accordance with the commitment of its governing body,  Naval Group has introduced a system in which the mapping  of corruption and influence peddling risks is the cornerstone.  In order to manage these risks, Naval Group has a code of  conduct and an associated documentary reference system, and  has an established awareness-raising and training program for  employees. Staff are required to report any conflict of interest,  whether real, potential or apparent. A third-party assessment  system has also been implemented. Lastly, regular internal  controls are carried out to ensure proper compliance with the  procedures in force.  A whistleblowing system (ethics@naval-group.com) is available  to Naval Group’s employees and external stakeholders to collect  and process alerts.   On the strength of this commitment at the  highest level, Naval Group obtained ISO 37001  certification on April 19, 2021. Naval Group is  one of the first French defence companies to  obtain this certification, which commits it to a  cycle of continuous improvement in terms of  its system.  “Naval Group is fully committed to the ﬁ ght against corruption  and inﬂ uence peddling and has made this one of its priorities. In a context  where the global economy is under strain, exacerbating competition between  players, this is a strong commitment to our customers and our business partners,  but also to civil society as a whole.”  Pierre Éric Pommellet, Chairman and Chief Executive Oﬃ    cer of Naval Group,  at the International Anti-Corruption Day event organised under the aegis  of the United Nations on December 9, 2020     Spotlight  The role of the Compliance Officer  The group’s dedicated Compliance Department implements  and coordinates the anti-corruption and influence peddling  system within the group. It relies on a network of Compliance  Officers in the various departments, sites and subsidiaries who  oversee the deployment of the group’s anti-corruption system.     They are available to inform, train and support employees in their  compliance-related work.  A survey on the ﬁ ght against corruption  and inﬂ uence peddling was carried out in  November 2021. More than 7,700 employees  took part. The results reﬂ ect both the increasing  attention of employees on the subject as well as  their understanding of the rules and procedures.  90% of them stated that they had received anti- corruption awareness-raising or training.

EXPORT AND CUSTOMS CONTROL   REGULATIONS  Naval Group’s activities and products have  strategic value through their contribution to  the sovereignty and security of client States.  As a company that exports products and  services for military or dual use, Naval Group  and its suppliers are required to comply with  national and international export control   regulations, which aim in particular to protect the national  security of democratic States and fight against diversion and  proliferation.  In light of these issues, Naval Group has set up an organisation   and processes to ensure compliance with these regulations.  Thus, Naval Group is in a good position to control and reduce  risks. To this end, the Export Control and Customs Affairs  Department  fully carries out its responsibilities as the group’s  second-line risk management. The latter provides ongoing  support to the operational departments  (sales, programs,  purchasing and supply chain in particular), by updating  standards, training, awareness-raising, advice and audits.  In  2021, the Export Control and Customs Affairs Department   carried out the main actions of its internal control plan, through  assessments and self-assessments in coordination with the  group’s other departments  .

A RENEWED DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION   POLICY FOR 2021  The diversity and  inclusion policy has  been a priority for the  group for the past ten  years. In the Naval  2025 transformation  program, diversity  and inclusion are positioned as key drivers of the company’s  transformation dynamic.  Naval Group wants the company to resemble society by  integrating genuinely diverse profiles (workers, technicians,  engineers, women and men) with varied social mix, training,  generations, origins, skills and talents, as well as diversity in  terms of life paths.  As part of its commitment to gender equality and its contribution  to SDG No. 5 of the United Nations Global Compact, Naval Group  signed the Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEP) on  February 11, 2021, joining the 4,552 companies that subscribe to  it worldwide.  These principles offer guidance to companies on how to promote  gender equality and the empowerment of women. Established by  the United Nations Global Compact and UN Women, the WEPs  are based on international labor and human rights standards.  They are based on the fact that companies have an interest in  and a responsibility towards gender equality.

[…] For us, the challenge is to be attractive, to recruit more women  in technical and scientiﬁ c specialities, to promote their access to positions of  responsibility and thus, to gradually rebalance the proportion of women and men  at all levels of the company”,  Pierre Éric Pommellet, Chairman and Chief Executive Oﬃ    cer of Naval Group,  at the signing of the WEP  In addition, a new agreement on diversity and inclusion was  signed with all the representative trade unions (CFDT, CGT,  UNSA, CFE-CGC), following constructive negotiations. It came  into force on October 1, 2021. The key objectives of this  agreement are: • to attract and integrate diverse profiles; • to develop employees’ careers and skills; • to promote inclusion in working groups; • to integrate diversity and inclusion into the societal  commitments and relations within the ecosystem.  ATTRACT AND RECRUIT MORE DIVERSE PROFILES    21% women at Naval Group in 2021  24% of women recruited in 2021            V. Pillar II: Social commitment  Although it is increasing every year, the percentage of women  working at Naval Group is currently low, as is the case for the  entire industrial sector. Few women study engineering and  production.  To improve gender parity in the company, Naval Group is  strengthening its initiatives to attract women to the industrial  sector, with the objective of recruiting 35% of women within the  group by 2025.  Since 2014, Naval Group has been a partner  of the Elles bougent network, an association  that strives to combat the stereotypes that  weigh on the industry and to encourage  women to pursue engineering careers within  the aviation, space, rail transport, maritime  and energy sectors.  The group has more than 200 sponsors of the  association who regularly carry out work to  present their professions to young women, high  school and university students, in order to raise  awareness of technical and scientific sectors.  This work is incorporated within the group’s  attractiveness policy managed by the Attractivity & Campus  Managers in each region.  Promote and enable the professional integration  of everyone  The integration of diverse profiles within the  group is not only a source of enrichment for  its employees but also a gain for the  company: employees learn to be more open  to the particularities of each individual, trust  is increased and the company performs  better. It is also a social justice matter.  However, some pockets of the population have more difficulty in  obtaining training or employment. This is why Naval Group has  implemented a proactive inclusion approach.  In 2021, Naval Group teams took part in several projects aimed  at offering jobs to young jobseekers in priority urban areas and  creating bridges between companies and young people.  In 2021, the Nantes site participated in three CSR Diversity job  dating events as part of the “Companies committed to Loire- Atlantique” initiative and #1jeune1solution [1 young person 1  solution], in favor of youth employment. On Friday, October 22,  2021, Naval Group received the 1 jeune 1 solution award  presented by Thibaut Guilluy, High Commissioner for Employment  and Business Engagement.  Partnerships with Handisup Bretagne and Handisup Normandie,  an association committed to supporting young students with  disabilities at the beginning of their careers, and with Osons  l'égalité, an association that works to implement actions  promoting the professionalisation  of young people with  disabilities by directing them towards training courses that  correspond to jobs in short supply in the naval defence industry,  have been renewed.  Naval Group has also partnered with Adapt Var, an association  that has created an apprenticeship training center (CFA) and that  supports companies recruiting young people with disabilities.  Other partnerships with associations such as Tremplin or with  vocational rehabilitation centers (e.g. CRP Millau 2ISA) help to  promote access to training and employment for young people  with disabilities.  Naval Group is a partner of the GESAT network, a group of  professional assistance institutions and services, and the  Association des Paralysés de France. In this context, the  company regularly co-organise s meetings with its specifiers  to exchange best practices in order to improve the share of its  purchases from the protected sector, in particular for industrial  services.  In 2021, purchases from this sector amounted to €3 million.  Naval Group’s disability mission has a dedicated annual budget.  In 2021, a new agreement was negotiated with the representative  trade unions, under which the annual budget for job retention  was increased by €75,000 compared to 2020, from €200,000 to  €275,000.  At December 31, 2021, Naval Group had 803 employees with  disabilities in its workforce. Between 2010 and 2021, Naval Group  doubled its employment rate for people with disabilities,  demonstrating the effectiveness of a proactive approach.

Naval Group’s professional equality index is  89/100, an increase of one point compared  to last year. This index enables companies   to measure the gender pay gap.  Naval Group pays particular attention to monitoring salary  policies so that the increase rate for women is at least equal to  the overall increase rate.  Specific measures (notably regarding maternity leave) are put in  place to continue to reduce the pay gap.  Initiatives are being launched at several sites. The one in Brest  has helped to create a community of women managers in Brest,  which is involved in concrete actions relating to gender diversity.  Its main areas of focus are to build attractiveness and change  mentalities; promote the career development of everyone within  the group; and develop a network that can drive change. The one  in Ollioules has had an active diversity network for several years,  which notably works to promote diversity.  Develop careers Progress remains to be made in terms of female access to  positions of responsibility: a target of 25% women on Executive  Committees has been set to accelerate the momentum. As part  of its career reviews, Naval Group undertakes to put forward at  least one woman in the Executive Committees’ succession plans.  A gender-balanced internal mentoring program was launched  in June 2021 to encourage skills development. The program is  40% made up of women and the pairs are generally mixed to  improve parity.  Naval Group reaﬃ  rmed its objective to be a company in which women ﬂ ourish  and evolve in all its business lines on the occasion of the 2021 edition of Assises  de la Parité, an event that aims to help companies achieve their goals in this area.  “As an industrial company, today we have a fundamental role to play in improving  gender diversity and convincing women that all of our job roles are open to them.”  Pierre Éric Pommellet, Chairman and Chief Executive Oﬃ    cer of Naval Group  PROMOTE INCLUSION IN WORKING GROUPS  Fighting against sexual harassment and sexist behaviour  The group wants to enable everyone to  flourish in the company and penalises   inappropriate behavior.  A network of sexual harassment and  sexist behavior officers appointed by  the company and by the Social and  Economic Committees at each of the   group’s French sites has been set up. Their mission is to inform,  guide and support victims. The list of contacts at each site has  been distributed to and is on display at all sites. A process for   handling alerts is in place within Human Resources, as well as  a whistleblowing system (ethics@naval-group.com) which is  accessible to all employees and stakeholders.  The group has a zero-tolerance policy against sexual harassment  and sexist behavior. In the event of inappropriate behavior in the  workplace, disciplinary sanctions up to and including dismissal or  criminal and/or civil sanctions are incurred.  In January 2022, the company joined the #StOpE initiative to end  sexist behavior in the workplace. An e-learning training module  on the topic of sexual harassment and sexist behavior will be  made available to all Naval Group employees in 2022.

QUALITY OF LIFE AT WORK  In November 2021, 35 Naval Group  employees, including all members of the  Executive Committee, took part in DuoDays  at all our sites. For one day, they formed a  duo with a person with a disability to help  build their professional career in their sector  of activity (quality control, purchasing,  logistics, etc.).  This operation enables managers and employees to learn more  about the range of disability situations at work, to raise their  awareness of the assets and professional qualities of these  workers, and even to discover new talents. For people with  disabilities, this day is an opportunity to learn more about a  working environment, to start their own integration process  or to convince an employer of what they can offer in terms of  integration and performance.  In December, employees at the Cherbourg site were invited  to take part in Handipoursuite, a board game created by the  Association de gestion du fonds pour l'intégration des personnes  métiers (Agefiph). Its aim is to raise participants’ awareness  of disability at work and to dispel certain prejudices through a  knowledge quiz.  V.2.1.  A NEW AGREEMENT ON QUALITY OF LIFE AT WORK   (QVT)  A new Quality of Life at Work agreement  (QVT) was unanimously adopted by all the  representative trade unions (CFDT, CGT,  UNSA and CFE-CGC) on July 22, 2021. It  confirms Naval Group’s desire to become  more committed by defining and deploying  innovative systems aimed at strengthening   employee development on a daily basis.  It sets out basic and specific measures defined in the context of  local agreements signed with the trade unions representing each  site.  Since the end of August, it has been rolled out by the Social  Policy Department.  Quality of Life at Work within Naval Group is implemented  through the establishment of a working environment conducive  to well-being, promoting good relationships and giving meaning  to work. It is based on a good balance between professional and  private life and is also reflected in the commitment of employees  to a solidarity-based and civic-minded approach.  Practical sheets (transport, professional mediation, universal  service employment vouchers) and a QVT guide are made  available to employees, as is useful information on professional  mediation and team coaching.  At local level, negotiations took place during the last quarter of  2021 on the implementation of specific systems at the sites.

User guides are available to employees.  Bicycles, where conventional or electric, single or tandem, are all better for the environment!  Because increasing numbers of Naval Group employees are travelling to the Paris site by bike, the bicycle park has been extended (75% increase in the number of spaces).

SUPPORT EMPLOYEES DURING TIMES OF CRISIS  V.3.  PROMOTE THE GROUP’S ATTRACTIVENESS  Working during the health crisis The Covid-19 health crisis and the resulting lockdowns have had  a strong impact on Naval Group’s activities, forcing the company  to adapt and reorganise  itself to enable the continuity of  activities essential to the life of the company whilst guaranteeing  the health and safety of its employees.  The dedication of its teams all over the world has nevertheless  demonstrated the group’s human and economic resilience.  In 2020, in order to allow the gradual and controlled resumption  of activity, a healthcare framework was put in place. Developed  with the occupational health doctor in accordance with  government guidelines and best practices observed within the  group and externally, it has been continuously updated in 2020  and 2021 to take into account direct changes in government  directives and findings from its implementation in the entities.  The actions resulting from this framework have been applied  at all sites and internationally, thanks to translations of the  document into English and Portuguese.  End of the Australian Future Submarines (AFS) program On September 16, 2021, the Commonwealth of Australia notified  Naval Group of the termination for convenience of the Australian  Future Submarine (AFS) program.  The end of the program has impacted 650 employees in France  and 350 in Australia, who were dedicating 70% or more of their  working hours to this project.  The group’s management has made every effort to offer  everyone a transfer opportunity.  In order to give them priority, recruitment was temporarily  suspended (except for workers not involved in this contract).  In France, a taskforce of approximately 50 employees from  the Human Resources Department  was immediately set up to  look after the people affected at each site and to support them  through their transfers.  The objective is to match the skills and experiences mapped  among the displaced employees with available opportunities.  In Australia, the HR team swung into action, in collaboration  with the group and with Australian stakeholders, including the  Commonwealth of Australia, which opened a Talent Pool within  the Australian ASC shipyard. Support is coordinated at every  stage to guarantee fair treatment.  Naval Group’s objective is to maintain  its ability to secure and carry out all its  vessel programs and services in order to  guarantee customer satisfaction. It is for  this reason that the annual recruitment  volume exceeds 1,000 employees per year  over the next ten years.  To meet this ambitious recruitment and development challenge,  Naval Group relies on a clear and differentiating employer brand.  In 2021, the momentum started during the previous three years  (more than 4,500 new employees) continued with 1,233 new  hires, 513 work-study students and around 500 interns.  In an increasingly competitive environment, Naval Group has  succeeded in remaining one of the most attractive employers  for the various audiences (engineering students, students in  higher education, experienced employees, workers, technicians,  and managers).  STRENGTHENING THE GROUP’S REACH  Promoting jobs To support its attractiveness, Naval Group ensures, in partnership  with the Campus des Industries Navales (Cinav ), the promotion  of jobs in the maritime industry and in particular short-term jobs  among students, young graduates, and those in the national  education system and civil society.  Naval Group took part in the first edition of the Forum des  métiers de la défense et de la sécurité [Forum of Defence and  Security Professions] which took place in September 2021 in  Angoulême. The event helped to promote the reputation of the  Naval Group site in Angoulême-Ruelle and its integration within  the region.  In May 2021, a targeted recruitment campaign was launched  for male and female workers with a view to perpetuating skills  in the design and production professions, with a hundred new  machinist, welder, mechanic, etc. positions to be filled. The aim  of the campaign was also to raise awareness of the opportunities  offered by the company to female workers, thus promoting  gender diversity.

Naval Group  participates in numerous recruitment drives,  calibrated as close as possible to its target  market. In total, around 130 attractiveness   events – forums, conferences, visits to Naval Group sites,  etc. – were held in 2021, focusing on target schools and partners,  for the benefit of all of Naval Group’s needs.  The group has also undergone restructuring to maintain its  influential actions in spite of the health crisis. The group’s digital  showcase has been significantly modernised  and the company  is increasingly using digital resources to meet and discuss with  candidates.  In June 2021, an online “objective employment” forum was  organise d for work-study students, PhD students and interns  completing their company placements during the year. Held  100% remotely, the event included interactive conferences with  regional school relations managers, meetings with Naval Group  HR advisors, coaching interviews and a presentation of job  opportunities at the group’s various sites.  A targeted attractiveness policy: relationships  with schools and partnerships The group is continually strengthening its presence and visibility  in schools.  In October 2021, its teams presented, among other things, its  professional opportunities at the Trium forum organise d by  students from four leading engineering schools: Mines Paris- Tech, École des Ponts Paris Tech, ENSTA Paris and ENSAE Paris.  Éric Papin, Technical and Innovation Director, leads a conference  on the impacts of innovation and digital transformation in the  naval industrial sector at the Trium forum.

Their number increased from 28 to 34  in 2021.  Naval Group has a school network of around 400 degree courses  and has entered into or renewed around fifteen partnerships with  schools to meet the needs of sovereign families, business lines  experiencing staff shortages and new professions.            V. Pillar II: Social commitment  To develop its image, attract the experts of tomorrow and  advance the knowledge and technologies it needs, the group  also applies an active policy of cooperation in research and  innovation.  This is reflected in numerous partnerships with schools to  create joint laboratories (such as the Joint Laboratory in Marine  Technology, with Centrale Nantes).  Naval Group is also involved in chairs (sponsorship, industrial and  educational), schemes to which several manufacturers contribute  financially so that subjects of common interest (complex systems  engineering or artificial intelligence, etc.) can be explored further  through theses. At the end of 2021, the group was supporting  44 theses in connection with partner laboratories and academies.  A commitment to young people  For many years, Naval Group has pursued  an ambitious work-study policy and  reserves positions for its work-study  students, in particular in production  professions with a high level of skills  renewal.  Each year, Naval Group welcomes more   than a thousand young people into its teams, including more than  500 new work-study students in 2021.  Naval Group seeks to increase the recruitment rate of its work- study students, in particular in the research, production and IT  specialities. In these business lines, the objective is for at least  half of all recruits to be work-study students by 2025 (compared  to around 40% today).  Many young people choose to continue their studies at the end  of their work-study period. The objective for Naval Group is to  retain them so that they can apply at the end of their studies.  A “youth club” for former work-study students and interns  (Naval Group Alumni) is being prepared and will be launched in  the first half of 2022.  The group has also increased the support offered to its work- study students by setting up a career review to identify job  opportunities within the group and facilitate their recruitment.  An effective strategy Naval Group is one of the most attractive employers according to  candidate surveys.  In 2021, Naval Group made progress in the external recognition  of its attractiveness, achieving 21st place in the Universum  ranking of the most attractive companies for engineering schools  (an increase of three places compared to 2020) and for schools  with a baccalaureate + 2/+ 3 (an increase of eight places).  In June 2021, Naval Group joined the #Universum Top 3 in the  “Attractive and exciting products and services for engineering  executives” category, which rewards the uniqueness of its  activity.  In 2021, it also retained the prestigious Top 5 air naval and  defence sector label for engineering students and was awarded  the “stimulating framework” label.  THE INTERNAL APPEAL OF NAVAL GROUP  Internal mobility plays an essential role in retaining talent and  developing the skills of the group’s employees.  It is also a key factor in maximising  the efficiency of resources in  the performance of the group’s activities.  Naval Group offers many opportunities for professional mobility  at regional, national and international level, enabling everyone  to discover new products and share their knowledge. Whatever  their desire for mobility, the company supports its employees.  The first season of the Mobility Tour was launched in 2021 to  introduce employees to the professional opportunities and the  various sites throughout the group. Four events were held, in  Toulon, Ollioules, Saint-Tropez and Lorient. The Mobility Tour will  continue in 2022 for a second season.  There is a wide variety of career paths available. The promotion  of crossover careers concerns all activities in production, design,  support and many other business lines.  In September 2020, Naval Group signed a new agreement with  all of the representative trade unions. This has strengthened the  actions implemented to secure skills and successfully transfer  knowledge. It is accompanied by costed commitments that are  reviewed annually.  Through this agreement, Naval Group undertakes to: • continuously develop employees’ skills and focus on “on-the-  job” learning;  • develop knowledge transmission from experienced employees   to young people;  • successful programs thanks to a strategic jobs and skills   management agreement close to the field.

TRAIN AND MAINTAIN KEY SKILLS  THE CREATION OF SCHOOLS  The development, transmission and maintenance of skills are  a vital part of Naval Group’s strategy to guarantee national  sovereignty. Naval Group is a long-term company that must  perpetuate its cutting-edge skills in design, production and  cross-functional positions.  The transmission of knowledge is at the heart of the group’s  strategy, which must respond to a challenge of unprecedented  magnitude: nearly 6,000 retirements are planned over the  next ten years, the majority of which relate to the long-term  acquisition of technical skills.  The group has identified 220 jobs that must be preserved,  including some in particularly critical areas (nuclear propulsion,  safety-diving, submarine architecture, aviation facilities and  invulnerability).  In order to limit any risk of loss in these areas, the group is  implementing measures to acquire, retain, redeploy or renew the  skills it will need: • investment in core business training; • strengthening of the employer brand action plan; • partnerships with schools and training bodies to promote   recruitment in the key areas of its activity;  • support for Cinav, whose objective is the creation of naval  training courses and developing the attractiveness of the  sector.  In 2021, the main advances in the management of key skills were  as follows: • strengthening of the quantitative and qualitative adequacy   between the workload and internal resources, in coordination  with the operational GPEC approach, in particular related to the  needs of third-generation SSBN programs (3G SSBN ) and next- generation aircraft carriers (PA-Ng);  • in-depth support for critical skills, with enhanced management  of the five sovereign families (aviation, diving safety, submarine  architecture, nuclear propulsion, invulnerability);  • a sixth sovereign family, Propulsion, has been created to  respond to the challenges of securing skills in this area;  • criticality analysis of the 109 areas of technical expertise (ATE)  identified within the group, which shows stability compared  to previous years with 15 ATEs deemed critical, including five  covered by one sovereign family;  • consolidation of the school relationships and partnerships   strategy, with an improvement in the positioning of Naval Group  with priority schools, young people and families;  • reinforcement of learning in the workplace.  Since 2021, each key position holder has had a personal  development plan with a knowledge transmission plan according  to his or her age. A sixth sovereign family, Propulsion, has also  been created.  Naval Group created its design and  industrialisation  school in Cherbourg,  to meet the need for skills in certain areas  experiencing staff shortages. In 2021, it  expanded its training offering. In addition  to the integrator-designer curriculum, it  began to offer work-study programs for   five submarine-related professions. Over a period of three years,  85 people were trained, 76 of whom were hired on permanent  contracts.  In 2022, the  Haute École de formation soudage , which  Naval Group helped to create, will open its doors on the Cotentin  peninsula to train the best welders in France for the nuclear and  naval sectors, currently facing a shortage of qualified personnel.  The creation of this school will make it possible to secure future  recruitment and meet the local and national needs of companies  in these two sectors.  FIELD TRAINING AND MENTORING  Naval Group makes field training one of its priorities, particularly  through training projects and seamanship.  Tested in 2019, the training projects are offered to operators  as close as possible to the field to enable them to acquire a  perfect mastery of technical skills relating to specific high-stakes  operations.  Managed by the business lines and operational staff, the training  projects are based on employee experience, under the watchful  eye of a qualified third party. They are organise d within or  near the workshops, in modular units that imitate the working  environment.  In 2021, a specific visual identity was created to be the common  thread between all Naval Group training projects and convey the  common values of these projects.  These training courses will be renewed and developed in  2022, notably at the Brest site, where a school village will be  inaugurated.  Seamanship is a historical practice that assists the development  of the skills of junior employees by more experienced employees.   It is practiced in particular as part of the “Fridays at School”  programs dedicated to the learning or practice of technical skills.  In a similar vein, the HR Department  launched its first internal  mentoring program to encourage skills development and  continuous learning among mentees, through support from  experienced mentors. The first class welcomed 21 pairs.  I  I  I  1 2 0 2 T R O P E R Y T L B S N O P S E R L A C O S E T A R O P R O C  I  P U O R G L A V A N  22            V. Pillar II: Social commitment  V.5.  ENSURE THE QUALITY  OF SOCIAL DIALOGUE  The quality and dynamism of social dialogue are essential  levers for the company’s performance and the success of  its transformation. They contribute to the construction of a  social and contractual foundation, which is a determining  factor in employee trust in the company’s management and its  representatives.  To date, the policy has only been deployed in France, but the aim  is to develop an international approach for the key elements that  make up the group’s social foundation.  The organisation  of the Social Policy Department within the HR  Department  is focused on permanent, direct and constructive  social dialogue with employee representation and trade unions.  Their relations are based on the company agreement reviewed  in 2017, which devotes two chapters to social dialogue. As such,  the plan for all structuring projects is to apply a concerted and  participative approach with the relevant teams, upstream of the  project. Social partners are also involved in this process.  In its approach to social dialogue, Naval Group therefore goes  beyond its legal obligations in terms of transparency and  involvement of social partners in organisation al change projects.  In 2021, despite the health crisis, the contractual dynamic  has resumed through the conclusion of various agreements,  in particular four agreements signed with the employee  representative bodies.  To measure the quality of social dialogue, Naval Group takes this  contractual dynamic into account. In addition, a social climate  observatory has been established to anticipate risks of social  tension, and even conflict, and to identify social irritants as close  as possible to the field. The trial began in July at the Naval Group  site in Angoulême-Ruelle with three teams.  Some ﬁ gures:  –  in 2021, more than 70% of training hours were   planned in technical areas;  –  15% of the budget was allocated to on-the-job   training;  –  20 operational training projects;  –  12,882 hours of seamanship in 2021.

COMMITMENT TO REDUCING    THE ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT  VI.1.1.  CARBON FOOTPRINT: REDUCING THE GROUP’S CARBON   FOOTPRINT  The objectives of the low-carbon project  Naval Group is committed to meeting the  low-carbon targets set by the International  Maritime Organization (IMO) by 2050, in  accordance with United Nations SDG  No. 13. For Naval Group, the aim is to divide  its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by six  in 2050 compared to 2014.  “Improving the carbon footprint, reducing waste and the energy  consumption of sites” is one of the main areas of focus in the  group’s CSR strategy set in 2021. It has three clear and quantified  objectives: • to measure, manage and reduce the carbon footprint of our   sites and activities: -5% per year from 2021 to 2050;  • to reduce energy consumption: -5% in 2021 and -15% by 2025; • to improve the waste recovery rate (+10% in 2021) and reduce   the volume of non-hazardous waste.  The group’s carbon footprint As part of its ambition to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions  of its sites, Naval Group has chosen to assess its carbon footprint  annually.  This annual measurement is a regular check on the effectiveness  of the actions implemented as part of the low-carbon project.  Once analysed, it also enables the group to validate the various  priorities and, if necessary, to define new actions.  A. Description The assessment carried out covers the 2021 calendar year. This  report covers all of Naval Group’s activities carried out on the  sites and premises in France. It does not take into account the  activities carried out by subsidiaries in France or abroad.

In the absence of complete or reliable data, we are unable to  assess: • upstream freight (scope 3 – item 17); • all purchases (scope 3 – item 9); • hazardous waste (scope 3 – item 11); • use and end-of-life of finished products sold during the year   (scope 3 – items 18 and 19).  B. Results By using the source data collected and verified and by applying  the relevant emission factors, Naval Group SA’s carbon footprint  for 2021 is close to 217,000 metric tons of CO2eq.  This figure includes all categories including purchases. The  emission factors related to purchases must be refined and the  associated values handled with caution. For this reason, Figure 2  presents the regulatory greenhouse gas emissions assessment  (BEGES) excluding purchases (item 9 – Purchases).

C. Operational criterion of the proﬁ t-sharing agreement In order to support Naval Group’s efforts to reduce GHG  emissions, an operational criterion relating to the reduction of  these emissions has been added to the profit-sharing agreement.  The objective was to reduce scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 5%  between 2020 and 2021, at constant load.  This objective applies to items 1, 2 and 6 of the regulatory  BEGES.  “At constant load” means that the change in hours worked and  outdoor temperatures between 2020 and 2021 must be taken  into account.  Between 2020 and 2021, the hours worked by Naval Group  employees and temporary workers and by on-site service  providers and suppliers increased by almost 15%.  The unified degree days in 2020 were 15,471 (sum of the unified  degree days [DJU] of all Naval Group sites). In 2021, the unified  degree days totaled 17,517. This represents an increase of more  than 13% in heating requirements.  Note: the DJU for one year corresponds to the sum  for each day of the year of the diﬀ erence between  a reference temperature (18°C) and the average  temperature for the day. For example, if the average  temperature for the day is 15°C, add 3 (18-15) to  the DJU for the year.            VI. Pillar III: Environmental protection  By applying these correction factors to the raw data from the carbon assessment, the performance presented in the table below is  obtained:  Raw data for 2020 and corrected data for 2021  Categories of emissions  Numbers Emission items  Gross  2021  Net  2021  2020  t CO2eq  Perf.

D. Analyses Performance achieved in 2021 versus 2020 for items 1, 2 and 6  is the result of the actions implemented as part of the low- carbon project and in particular the efforts made by industrial  coordination and site management in relation to energy.  In order to maintain the group’s objective of reducing GHG  emissions by 5% per year on scopes 1 and 2, the low-carbon  project must be continued and strengthened.  Energy and carbon plans have been defined at the group’s  various sites. Thanks to the measures put in place, Naval Group  has the ability to achieve the expected results over the next two  years by deploying initiatives based on the following themes: • reducing the consumption of buildings and industrial facilities; • developing renewable energy solutions (photovoltaic, etc.); • implementing energy management software; • optimising the vehicle fleet to increase the percentage of non-  internal combustion engines.  In 2022, the objective is to work on the five-to-ten-year  roadmap, so as to identify the actions required to meet the GHG  emission reduction targets.  Technological advances are necessary for our infrastructures  and our heat production resources; we will have to anticipate and  finance them.  To take things even further, the low-carbon project already  includes projects related to scope 3 (freight, mobility, digital and  waste). However, areas for improvement remain to be identified  for emissions linked to purchases.  VI.1.2.  OVERVIEW OF THE ACTIONS IMPLEMENTED AT   THE GROUP’S SITES  The daily activities of the group’s sites involve direct and indirect  GHG emissions for the heating, air conditioning and lighting of  workplaces, the production of domestic hot water, the supply of  industrial resources, the reception and the equipment shipping  and employee business travel.  In order to achieve the carbon emission reduction targets set by  the group, the sites are introducing multiple initiatives to aid in  their transformations.  The projects set up relate to energy, service and company  vehicles, freight, the company mobility plan and digital activities.  Each is managed by a manager in the relevant area, who reports  regularly to the Director of Industrial Coordination.  Significant progress has been made in 2021.  Better control of energy consumption  The Angoulême-Ruelle site has reduced its energy consumption  by 10%: • by installing a more energy-efficient boiler, new types of   radiators and a water-based regulation system;  • by introducing new temperature guidelines for heating and air   conditioning with a drop of 1°C;  • by deploying energy management software to measure the  energy consumption of the site’s facilities, identify the most  energy-intensive and reduce their use; • by installing a dedicated air compressor.

LED lighting has continued to be installed at the Brest and  Cherbourg sites.  By mid-2022, all the workshops at the Brest site, including Île  Longue, will be lit by LEDs. In Cherbourg, 190 exterior masts were  equipped and a major interior lighting renovation project was  launched to replace 12,500 light points over four years, starting  with the most energy consuming. This will also optimise  the  lighting on site.  The Lorient site is also gradually installing LEDs. In 2021, it signed  a protocol to install a solar power plant in a car park on the site,  which will produce the equivalent of 5% of its consumption from  October 2022.  For its heating and hot water needs, the Brest site will soon  recover the energy produced by the city’s household waste  incineration unit, which will reduce the CO2 emission ratio per  kilowatt/hour consumed by four times.  Tomorrow charter: committing to local authorities  to be more successful together  The Naval Group site  in Brest has signed  the Tomorrow charter,  joining the initiative of  Brest Métropole, one  of the six European  cities that have  committed to ﬁ ghting  climate change with   the support of local stakeholders.  This charter is based on six areas of focus:  saving energy and switching to renewable  energies, moving around in a diﬀ erent way, eating  sustainably, reducing and recovering waste, acting  globally and locally, raising awareness and making  behavioral changes.  The charter commits the city to reducing its GHG  emissions by 34% and its energy consumption by  20% by 2030, compared to 2010.  Adapting employee mobility to environmental challenges Travel between home and work and within  sites is a major source of greenhouse gas  emissions. A group employee survey on  travel habits between home and work and  during lunch breaks was conducted in 2021.  Its results have been incorporated into the  GHG assessment and will help the   Occupational Health and Safety and Environment Department  and  the mobility managers at the various sites to adapt the mobility  plans by developing actions tailored to current requirements.  An  action plan was defined in the first quarter of 2022.  The Brest site is working with the metropolis to set up bus routes  that cover the naval base, including one departing from the  station. Electrically-assisted bicycles are made available free of  charge for commuting and at one of the entrances to the naval  base, in order to promote multimodal travel.  The site has also set up a closed community on the Ouest-Go  carpooling platform, in collaboration with other local players, and  increased the number of carpooling spaces available at the naval  base, in coordination with the French Navy.  The Cherbourg site works with the urban area and the city,  sharing its expectations in terms of changes in mobility. In 2023,  a next-generation bus service will be launched with a view to  transforming transport practices in the region for the benefit of  collective and/or soft mobility.  In 2021, the Lorient site launched a project to install 20 charging  points for electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles. This project follows  the group’s decision to install charging stations at all of its sites  in France.  In terms of its company vehicle fleet, Naval Group has eliminated  diesel vehicles and introduced electric vehicles to its catalogue.  It has significantly increased its fleet of electric service vehicles.  In terms of freight, lower-emission transport solutions are being  defined with the group’s partner.  Digital activities  Seeking digital sobriety  Naval Group has committed to designing  digital services that consume less energy  and moderating its daily digital use.  The group contributes to the work led  by CIGREF (network for large French  companies), which collects and shares  best practices relating to digital culture. An   awareness-raising quiz on this topic is available on the online  training portal and every month, an IT-related tip is shared via the  monthly internal newsletter.  In addition, Naval Group’s Digital and Information Systems  Department  (DDSI) participates in the working group on digital  sobriety led by Cigref, which resulted in the drafting and  publication of the report entitled Digital sobriety: managing  the environmental footprint of digital technology through  measurement. This work will continue in 2022.  The assessment of the digital carbon footprint of the group’s  information system and the drafting of a guide for responsible IT  purchases are other actions implemented by the DDSI.            VI. Pillar III: Environmental protection  Streamlining datacenters   Over the past three years, Naval Group has  been optimising  and streamlining its data  centers in order to reduce its carbon  footprint whilst meeting its needs for digital  services and digitis ation . In Ollioules, a local  Energy Committee was created in 2019 to  come up with an action plan to reduce the   energy gap at the site, where IT platforms are in operation seven  days a week. The challenge is to optimise  their consumption  without hindering production.  The group is investing in new, less energy-intensive and more  efficient devices, in which it focuses its computing power  requirements. A single machine can now host several servers, the  latter being virtualised . Data storage needs are streamlined and  optimise d. In addition, this new equipment uses less energy- consuming air conditioning solutions.  At the end of 2021, several employees at the Ollioules site  created an expression group called “Being eco-responsible  in the office”. The various proposals it collected were used  to develop, in coordination with the site’s Communications  Department , a roadmap composed of actions complementary  to those implemented at group level, associated with a local  communications plan.  During Sustainable Development Week, a call to  adopt ten easy actions to combat climate change  was launched at group level through ﬂ yers and the  intranet.  Naval Group recalled that some of these changes  in behavior helped contribute to the operational  criterion set by the 2021-2023 proﬁ t-sharing  agreement, which set a 5% reduction per year in  the group’s GHG emissions.  Les10 gestes  à adopter pour l’environnement  Dans notre quotidien, certains gestes sont faciles à adopter pour réduire notre impact sur  l’environnement et le réchauffement climatique.  L’accord d’intéressement 2021-2023 de Naval Group comprend un critère opérationnel sur le bilan  des gaz à effet de serre. Parmi les 10 gestes ci-dessous, les n°6, 7, 8 et 9 permettent à chaque  collaborateur d’y contribuer.

Multiple communication  campaigns are carried out at all sites to  raise awareness and inform as many staff as  possible about the importance of  environmental issues and encourage them   to take action personally.  The Nantes-Indret site ran an Environment energic challenge  over a period of three months, with the help of an application  designed to promote the long-term involvement of employees  in their company’s CSR policy. The tool encourages users to  calculate and then reduce their carbon footprint.  In Cherbourg, during European Week for Waste Reduction  in November 2021, the Occupational Health and Safety and  Environment teams and members of the Digital and Information  Systems Department  shared quizzes and gave away prizes,  hosted a stand and organise d a presentation of the waste  management cycle in conjunction with Veolia.

Information on the classification of waste has been  published to help employees identify what can and can’t be  recycled.  The Paris and Bagneux sites have also eliminated individual bins  in the offices and introduced systematic separation and sorting.  Since 2017, the Toulon site has been giving a second life to  computer equipment that has been replaced on the boats,  by  using the spare parts in other vessels. Today, a re-use study  is conducted for all vessel modernisation  and decommissioning  works.  Another group-wide initiative, inspired by World Clean Up Day,  is an IT equipment recycling initiative that has been introduced  at all sites. The equipment is recovered or recycled by ATF  Gaïa, a company specialising  in the life cycle management of  IT equipment.  VI.1.3.  BIODIVERSITY: THE SEA AT THE HEART OF NAVAL GROUP’S ACTIONS  Duty to preserve biodiversity  The sea is at the heart of the group’s activities and ambitions but it remains a fragile environment. In addition to the  fight against global warming, the challenge of the “Environmental protection” pillar is therefore to protect marine  biodiversity.  “The preservation of marine and underwater ecosystems is one of  the company’s values that guide our development. For more than ten years now, we have been carrying out in-depth work   on the eco-design policy of our vessels to prevent and control the eﬀ ects related  to our products and our industrial processes. But we have decided to take things even further. To limit the environmental  footprint of the vessels, we are examining alternatives to the use of  fossil resources. Naval Group relies in particular on fuel cell technologies  and hydrogen storage in surface vessels. Decarbonisation also means improving our energy eﬃ  ciency. Hence the signiﬁ cant  eﬀ ort we are making on new generations of very high-performance batteries  that will require less recharging time and give our vessels more autonomy. We are proud to apply innovation and technology to this major challenge.”  Pierre Éric Pommellet, Chairman and Chief Executive Oﬃ    cer of Naval Group,  on World Environment Day 2021  The Ocean framework, a reporting framework to assess  the impact of companies on the marine environment  Naval Group has tested the first reporting  framework intended to measure the impact  of companies’ activities on the oceans.  Based on SDG No. 14 of the Global  Compact on aquatic life, this framework  was developed by the Fondation de la Mer,  in collaboration with the Boston Consulting   group and the French Ministry for the Ecological Transition, to  support companies in the preservation and sustainable use of  ocean resources.  It identifies ten types of impact, broken down into 44 action  levers and as many operational indicators that can be used  by  companies.  In the first half of 2021, the group entered into a partnership  with the Fondation de la Mer to conduct an impact analysis  of its activities and issue proposals for action using the ocean  framework. In the second half of the year, Naval Group and the  Fondation de la Mer signed a contractual agreement.  Four impact assessment workshops were held in 2021 at the Brest  and Nantes-Indret sites. They will be used to support the roll-out  of the ocean framework to all sites in France and to our products.            VI. Pillar III: Environmental protection  Group sites take action  In line with the group’s approach, some  coastal sites are taking steps to limit their  impact on coastal biodiversity.  At the Toulon site, as part of the adaptation  of the infrastructure for the maintenance  of nuclear attack submarines (SNA), such  as the Suffren, the refurbishment of the   maintenance basins includes improvements to reduce the impact  of in-service support on the natural environment. The MY01  basin can now separate the water used to wash the submarine  hulls from the water used to cool the nuclear boiler room during  short-term periods of maintenance. Collected in a dedicated  tank, following the segregation of the basin networks, this water  is treated before being discharged into the natural environment.  Since 2008, the Toulon site has also been a partner of the “Clean  Harbour” operation, launched by the maritime prefecture. It  installs skips to collect waste found at sea by French Navy divers.  The skips are then emptied and the contents processed through  the appropriate channels.  Combating the noise impact of our products on marine  biodiversity  Since 2019, Naval Group has been managing the European  project PIAQUO to protect marine life from noise pollution. This  project combines the expertise in underwater acoustics and  digital modelling of ten French, Italian and Swedish partners.  The goal is to reduce the impact of underwater noise pollution  generated by maritime traffic, which has increased significantly  over the last 50 years due to the growth in trade and the tonnage  of vessels.  The aim is to offer a coherent set of technological solutions for  maritime transport players (port and industrial operators, etc.),  to protect ecosystems sensitive to such noise as well as to  anticipate future regulations.  The project, which is part of the European Union’s  Green New Deal strategy, is based on areas of research  including more discreet propellers, on-board systems for  real-time self-assessment of the level of noise emitted,  and programs to raise ship-owner awareness of the importance  of reducing noise emissions.

INVENTING THE VESSEL OF THE FUTURE  VI.2.1.  ECO-DESIGN FOR THE VESSEL OF THE FUTURE  “Our objective is for, in ﬁ ve years’ time, all new projects to incorporate  environmental requirements and be clearly aligned with this approach.  We are witnessing a paradigm shift: it will soon be necessary to justify the reasons  why a project does not include environmental requirements.”  Gaëlle Rousseau, Eco-Design Manager at Naval Group and pilot of the “Integrating  eco-design throughout the life cycle of new products and services” project  Eco-design: incorporating environmental requirements  Carbon footprint of products in service  To meet its commitments to reduce its emissions, Naval Group  has been relying for ten years on eco-design and the ISO 14001  certification of its products, services and activities.  Eco-design aims to reduce significant environmental impacts in  the life cycle of vessels, from their design to their deconstruction,  including operation, manufacture and maintenance.  In addition to the fight against global warming, the challenges of  eco-design are economic, through better control of production  costs (energy consumption, waste recovery, etc.) and operational  costs, thanks to increased autonomy and discretion for boats  generated by new means of hybrid propulsion. Lastly, there is  the issue of competitiveness and Naval Group intends to remain  ahead of the curve in the naval defence market.  Eco-design is supported by the environment and eco-design  business sector, which coordinates the approach and relies on  a network of approximately 50 specialists working on projects  related to their area of expertise.  Located within the Naval Performance Engineering Department  (IPN) of the Industry Department  (DIN), the environmental design  managers apply environmental requirements to vessel projects  and programs and actively participate in R&D.  In 2021, Naval Group strengthened its commitment to eco- design: the eco-design project was included in the CSR strategy.  The aim is to roll out this approach across all components of the  vessel’s life cycle, from R&D to production tools.  Since 2013, the International Maritime  Organization (IMO) requires new vessels to  measure their effectiveness in reducing CO2  emissions. Naval Group has decided to  respond by measuring the carbon footprint  of its flagship products as well as their  energy efficiency.  Following in the footsteps of the multi-mission frigate (FREMM)  in 2017, the corvette Gowind® (in 2018) and the submarine  Scorpène® (in 2019), the carbon footprint of the Barracuda  nuclear attack submarine (SNA) was measured in 2021. The  results of these studies have led to the following conclusions: • although the results of the FREMM and Gowind® carbon   footprints are not comparable, as the vessels have completely  different job profiles, weights, speeds and lifetimes, it is  interesting to note that the share attributable to the operating  phase of these vessels represents respectively 80% and 90% of  the total carbon footprint, which is mainly related to the diesel  used;  • as for the Scorpène®, the ratio is less marked: 35% of GHG  emissions are generated during the manufacturing phase  compared to only 55% during operation;  • for the Barracuda, the results obtained differ from those of   the Scorpène®: the manufacturing phase is the most important  since it represents 65% of the GHG emissions. This is due  to the resources used to machine the specific steels used.  The operating phase represents only 1.3%, due to the nuclear  propulsion method, which emits less CO2 than a conventional  diesel propulsion.  The overhaul of the eco-design assessment system  Eco-design objectives have been set for  programs, infrastructures and maintenance  in operational conditions.  In terms of programs, the eco-design  approach, previously organise d into three  levels, was overhauled in 2021.  I  I  I  1 2 0 2 T R O P E R Y T L B S N O P S E R L A C O S E T A R O P R O C  I  P U O R G L A V A N  32            VI. Pillar III: Environmental protection  The former level 3, known as “proactive”, has been split into  three more precise levels to ensure easier comparison with the  standards: Capacity Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), Green  Marine Europe, etc.  The Blue Ship area of focus represents Naval Group’s  commitment to blue growth and its desire for excellence and  leadership in this area. The group strives to promote this priority  in order to encourage its customers to make the same choices.  Smart Industry is its equivalent for the factory of the future,  whose objective is to offer a competitive, collaborative, agile,  flexible, economical and low-environmental impact industrial  facility.  The levels used are as follows: • level 1: systematic application of the Naval Group regulatory   standard;  • level 2: at least two environmental studies on systems; • level 3: environmental analysis or life cycle analysis during  the design phase, followed by the allocation of eco-design  requirements;  • level 4: proposed green technologies with a minimum gain of  20% on the significant environmental aspects (SEA) resulting  from the analyses;  • level 5: proposed green technologies on all SEA with a minimum   gain of 50%.  Level N can only be reached after level N-1 has been achieved.  Quantiﬁ ed targets  A mapping of the programs according to this new breakdown  was carried out. This inventory, as well as the R&D roadmaps and  the marketing vision, are the foundations on which the definition  of objectives for the coming years should be based.  On the R&D side, the integration of the environment into the  technical innovation project sheets (FPIT) was redefined during  the year. A criterion called the environmental performance  index (EPI) has been included in the FPIT format to characterise   the consideration of the environment in the innovation being  researched. It will be applied from 2022.  Blue Ship and Smart Industry  A key driver of the ecological transition, R&D is at the heart of  Naval Group’s CSR project. The two main unifying areas of R&D  that focus on the environment are Blue Ship and Smart Industry.  They must engage Naval Group in the challenge of the ecological  and energy transition.  Blue Ship aims to guarantee, by pooling energy and hybridis ing   sources, that ships have the energy autonomy required for  all current and future missions, with the smallest possible  environmental footprint.   ¬  100% of projects to follow an eco-design   approach by 2050 (compared to a target of 50%  in 2021).   ¬  50% of R&D sheets to contribute positively  to the environment by 2025 (compared to  a target of 20% in 2021).  2021 performance indicators   ¬  72% of all vessel projects underway in 2021  follow a “proactive” approach (according to  criteria in force until 2021).   ¬  18.5% of R&D sheets to contribute positively   to the environment.  NB: The monitoring of eco-design processing  will continue to evolve. The relevant indicator will  no longer be the number of FPITs contributing  positively to the environment but the share of the  budget allocated to such R&D sheets. It will better  reﬂ ect the performance of Naval Group in terms  of the integration of green technologies in future  programs and the resources allocated to R&D  areas to achieve this, in particular those related  to Blue Ship.

THE ECO-ENERGY TRANSITION OF THE MARITIME SECTOR  The coalition for the eco-energy transition of the maritime  sector (T2EM)  The French Maritime Cluster (CMF) brings together players in  the maritime ecosystem, from industry to maritime services and  activities of all kinds. It supports its members in the sustainable  and responsible development of their activities and projects  through a variety of means.  At the Assises de l'économie de la mer [Conference on the  Maritime Economy] in December 2019, it created the coalition  for the eco-energy transition of the maritime sector (T2EM), in  partnership with the French Ministry of the Sea and the Ecological  Transition Agency (ADEME), in order to actively contribute to the  achievement of the objectives set by the Paris Agreement.  This coalition is open to as many bodies as possible – start-ups,  SMEs, MSEs, large groups, academics, media, research centers,  regions, departments – to collectively meet the needs of the  maritime sector and share a common vision of solutions that will  make it possible to achieve the objectives of carbon neutrality  and emission reductions, as well as the protection of biodiversity,  by 2050.  Naval Group’s contribution to the work of T2EM As a founding member of this coalition, Naval Group is keen to  play a leading role and is fully mobilised to seek solutions to  benefit the environment.  The group first took part in working groups that led to the  identification of ten priority topics linked to concrete projects  that could be implemented quickly. It also shared its progress on  the energy and environmental aspects with the various players  comprising the coalition.  Their collective work should not only accelerate the emergence  of innovative solutions but also help these players obtain external  financing for their projects.  “Our Blue Ship R&D roadmap includes many projects that will contribute  to a reduction in our emissions. Our work is based on three main levers: further  electriﬁ cation of vessels, improving the energy eﬃ  ciency of their systems,  and the use of alternative fuels. We are counting on the T2EM coalition to create an environment  conducive to innovative technological solutions.”  Bertrand Lars, Director of the Energy technical ﬁ eld and leader of the Blue Ship R&D focus  A digital platform to develop solutions In order to define a shared vision for a new energy reference  framework and to identify and implement solutions, the T2EM  coalition has since 2021 been working to develop a digital  platform for the exchange of data, information and decision- making support, management and collaboration.  This platform is designed to facilitate synergies between all  players – in particular, it will make it possible to connect project  leaders seeking specific skills or financing from partners. It  should also help to inform decision-makers’ choices, accelerate  the emergence of regional energy transition projects and monitor  the trajectories and impacts of the transformations undertaken.  The T2EM Institute  In February 2022, the CMF created the Institute for the Energy  Transition of the Maritime Industry, called Institut Maritime  Eco- Energy Transition toward 2050 (MEET2050).  This creation was announced at the One Ocean Summit held  in Brest and attended by the French President, who officially  announced the State’s support for the transition of maritime  transport.  MEET2050 is a lean structure whose function is to define and  manage the “Zero emission vessels and ports” program, an  extension of the work carried out since December 2019 by  the T2EM coalition.  Like the companies involved in the 2019 coalition, Naval Group  has joined this institute, which will coordinate the existing  research centers, with the aim of launching nine concept vessels  by 2030-2035, as part of a huge €1.5-billion plan to mobilise   public and private financing.            VII. Pillar IV: Naval Group, a responsible  industrial partner  VII.1. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY AND   ENVIRONMENT (HS&E ) POLICY  The HS&E  policy is an integral part of the  group’s strategy and its transformation plan.  Providing its employees with a calm working  environment that protects their physical and  mental health is a prerequisite and a sign of  the group’s commitment to operational  excellence.  This policy is part of a global quality, safety and environment  (QSE) policy, which has been revised and signed by the  Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer. It brings together the  group’s ambitions and requirements and provides a general  overview thereof, in order to meet the needs and expectations of  its customers, develop a culture of risk identification and control  and ensure regulatory compliance.  Under the responsibility of the Director of Operations and  Performance, it is deployed at local level by prevention teams  made up of prevention coordinators and advisors, led by  prevention managers. Together with the site managers, they  ensure risk prevention, provide advice and expertise to operators  and management (with the support of experts) and manage the  coordination of activities from the point of view of the HS&E .  DEPLOYMENT OF THE HS&E  ROADMAP  The Occupational Health and Safety and  Environment (HS&E ) roadmap was drawn up  in the first half of 2021.  Among the main advances in the field of  health, we can mention the recruitment  of additional doctors at the sites and the  acquisition of exoskeletons, to facilitate the  work of employees. In the field of occupational health and safety,  awareness-raising sessions on the prevention of musculoskeletal  accidents and diseases have been organise d and targeted action  plans were drawn up. In terms of the environment, an energy  savings plan and a mobility survey (see chapter III, section 1.2)  were rolled out.  I  I  I  1 2 0 2 T R O P E R Y T L B S N O P S E R L A C O S E T A R O P R O C  I  Naval Group has confirmed the ISO 9001 (quality) and ISO 14001  (environment) certifications of its global quality, safety and  environment (QSE) management system, and strengthened them  by obtaining ISO 45001 certification (HS&E ), which replaced the  OHSAS 18001 certification.  P U O R G L A V A N  35  Furthermore, one of the main levers used by Naval Group to  involve management and change the behavior of employees at its  sites is training. To complement the existing system (training of  all new employees and for any new appointment), Naval Group  will set up an  HS&E  managerial passport for all managers working  at a site, to ensure that he or she is aware of their own HS&E   responsibilities. Through this training, he/she will be made aware  of risk assessments, accident management and employee safety  management.  An  HS&E  manager for international activities, who reports to the  group HS&E  Director, was appointed in February 2021. Their role  is to define an action plan incorporated within the group’s annual  general roadmap for the international scope and to upgrade  processes, where necessary. In the group’s six subsidiaries with  the largest workforce (Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, India, Egypt, Brazil  and Singapore), a network of HS&E  officers, which it coordinates,  has been set up. It is actively committed to defining and  implementing the highest standards.            VII. Pillar IV: Naval Group, a responsible industrial partner  HS&E  AT THE GROUP’S SUBCONTRACTORS  The 2021 results of the accident  assessment of certain suppliers at the  Naval Group sites do not meet the  company’s expectations in the field.  Naval Group believes that improving the  safety at work of its suppliers and partners  benefits individual and collective   performance as well as the entire ecosystem of the naval sector.  Naval Group wants to build a long-term culture of safety to  be shared with its suppliers, combining a technical approach,  appropriate behavior for managers and players in the field, taking  into account human and organisation al factors and ways of  thinking and doing.  Taking into account Occupational Health and Safety and  Environment when selecting partners is therefore a new vector of  its purchasing performance.  The five main components of the prevention of serious HS&E   accidents at its suppliers include: • the positioning of HS&E  in its purchasing requirements at the   right level and with the right suppliers;  • integrating the HS&E  aspect into the selection of suppliers,   when assessing them with a view to adding them to the group’s  panel, then as part of the calls for tenders, by integrating this  criterion into the selection criteria;  • site safety preparation, including the reception of suppliers on   site;  • the managing and executing work in a manner that is safe for   people and the environment;  • assessing suppliers’ HS&E  performance, through feedback and   a process of continuous improvement.     Spotlight  The ten golden rules of Occupational Health and Safety and  Environment HS&E   Since 2019, an HS&E  communication plan has been implemented  to share results, actions and programs with all employees and  obtain the support of everyone. In 2021, awareness-raising  campaigns on shared vigilance and the golden rules were  renewed.  THE 10 GOLDEN RULES OF SAFETY  1 - SHARED VIGILANCE  KEEP YOURSELF SAFE AND YOUR  WORK COLLEAGUES SAFER   6 - TRAINING AND COMPETENCY HOLD THE REQUIRED TRAINING AND  COMPETENCY FOR THE TASK  2 - STOP CALL WAIT STOP – CALL – WAIT WHEN  FACING AN UNSAFE SITUATION  7 - PPE  WEAR APPROPRIATE  PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT  (cid:281)(cid:3)(cid:331)(cid:3)(cid:28)(cid:88)(cid:39)(cid:73)(cid:67)(cid:73)(cid:66)(cid:47)(cid:18)(cid:92)(cid:321)(cid:85)(cid:73)(cid:92)(cid:98)(cid:103)(cid:88)(cid:28)(cid:343)(cid:3) ADOPT ERGONOMICAL POSTURE  8 - PEDESTRIAN AND VEHICLE TRAFFIC  USE DEDICATED ALLEYS AND COMPLY  WITH TRAFFIC RULES  4 - SIMULTANEOUS OPERATIONS (SIMOPS) COMPLY WITH COORDINATION  INSTRUCTIONS  9 - BARRICADING AND SIGNAGE DELINEATE YOUR WORK AREA; AND COMPLY  WITH WARNING SIGNS AND BARRICADING  5 - WORK PREPARATION AND HOUSEKEEPING PREPARE, SET UP AND MAINTAIN GOOD HOUSEKEEPING OF YOUR WORK AREA  (cid:279)(cid:278)(cid:3)(cid:331)(cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:73)(cid:66)(cid:85)(cid:61)(cid:47)(cid:4)(cid:67)(cid:98)(cid:3)(cid:98)(cid:73)(cid:73)(cid:61)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:67)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:28)(cid:87)(cid:103)(cid:47)(cid:85)(cid:66)(cid:28)(cid:67)(cid:98)(cid:343)(cid:3) USE ONLY APPROPRIATE AND COMPLIANT  TOOLS OR EQUIPMENT   Safe by choice,  not by chance.  ASSESSMENT OF HS&E  PERFORMANCE  Naval Group’s HS&E  performance is  monitored using several indicators: the  number of accidents with lost time (AAA),  supplemented by frequency rate 1 (TF1), the  frequency rate of accidents with lost time  per million hours worked, and the severity  rate (TG), the number of days compensated   x 1,000/number of hours worked.  Results from 11/01/2020 to 10/31/2021  AAA: 165  TF1: 6.4  TG: 0.135  I  I  I  1 2 0 2 T R O P E R Y T L B S N O P S E R L A C O S E T A R O P R O C  I  P U O R G L A V A N  36            VII. Pillar IV: Naval Group, a responsible industrial partner  CSR ASSESSMENT OF SUPPLIERS  Since 2012, Naval Group has been supported  in the assessment of its suppliers by the  service provider EcoVadis, whose platform  assesses their commitment with regard to  four main topics from the ISO 26000 standard:  the environment, sustainable procurement,  compliance and social.  Naval Group’s objective is to assess all suppliers in the panel, i.e.  1,200 companies. To achieve this objective, Naval Group teams  work in stages, focusing on suppliers with a high CSR risk.  In 2021, Naval Group updated the CSR risk mapping related  to purchases. This enables it to assess risks relating to the  environment, health and safety, human rights and ethics, for each  of the group’s procurement categories, by integrating elements  related to purchasing data (volume of business and geographical  location of suppliers).  More than 180 types of purchases were listed according to  an international standard industrial classification, including  11 types of purchases constituting a risk, present at the group’s  450 suppliers.  Special training is provided to buyers to give them the tools  to encourage suppliers to adopt the approach undertaken by  Naval Group.  The need to collaborate with Naval Group to work in a  sustainable, responsible and transparent manner was reiterated  to the group’s major suppliers at a meeting in October 2021  during the Naval Partners meeting suppliers convention.  These results show an increase in the number of AAA and TF1  compared to previous years but also a clear decrease in the  severity rate.  The average number of days lost per workplace accident over  the period was 21 days, compared to 25 days in 2020.  The accident figures of external companies on site are monitored  internally.  VII.2.    DUTY OF CARE AND SUSTAINABLE  PROCUREMENT  Given the strategic and sensitive aspect of the sector in which  Naval Group operates, strict control of relations with its suppliers,  control of its subsidiaries and responsibility assumed in its  commercial relations are essential for the group to ensure its  sustainability.  VIGILANCE PLAN  In accordance with French Law No. 2017-399  on the Duty of Care of Parent Companies and  Ordering Companies, Naval Group has  introduced a plan containing due diligence  measures to identify risks and prevent  serious violations of human rights and  fundamental freedoms, human health and   safety and the environment.  This plan, available in more detail in the group’s 2021 financial  report, takes into account the activities of the group itself and  those of its subcontractors and leading suppliers.  It includes: • risk mapping; • procedures for regular assessment of the position of the group,  its subsidiaries, suppliers and subcontractors, with regard to  these risks;  • tailored actions for risk mitigation and actions to prevent   serious harm;  • a whistleblowing line (ethics@naval-group.com); • a system for monitoring the measures implemented and   assessing their effectiveness.

All the  ambitions of our 2021-2025 strategy are linked  to this. It reﬂ ects our awareness of contributing  to the competitiveness and performance of our  customers, not only economically, but also socially  and environmentally.”  Bénédicte Birgand, Head of CSR at Idéa.  In concrete terms, Idéa is taking action to improve  the energy eﬃ  ciency of its transport and sites.  The group is investing heavily in biogas trucks,  which will constitute 40% of its ﬂ eet in 2025. It  has also committed to producing low-carbon  energy locally by building a biogas plant in Montoir- de-Bretagne – it will start production start this  year – and by increasing its electricity production by  installing photovoltaic panels on its platforms, as is  already the case at four of its sites.  A CERTIFIED POLICY  The sustainable procurement policy  implemented by Naval Group to  ensure sustainable and balanced  relationships with its suppliers, while  contributing to the management of  the risk of corruption and conflicts of  interest, has earned it the  Responsible Supplier Relations label  every year since 2014, which  became the Responsible Supplier   and Procurement Relations (RFAR) label in 2017.  Awarded by the Médiation des Entreprises of the French Ministry  of the Economy and Finance, it recognises  French companies  that demonstrate long-term and balanced relationships with their  suppliers. Since 2017, this label has had an international scope due  to the fact that it is linked to standard ISO 20400 on sustainable  procurement, which sets out guidelines for incorporating CSR into  procurement processes and supply chains.  This label was renewed in February 2021, as was the ISO 20400  certification.  Among Naval Group’s strengths, the Procurement Committee  noted the integration of the sustainable procurement policy  into its CSR roadmap, the steps taken for the benefit of SMEs  and critical industrial sectors to consolidate the defence  technological and industrial base, as well as its contribution to  regional development, in particular thanks to the group’s strong  involvement in the Campus des Industries Navales (Cinav).  ISO 20400 certification also enables the company to identify  areas for improvement and the best practices to be implemented.  “Obtaining this label is testament to our best practices vis-à-vis SMEs in the  naval sector; we should all be very proud. It is also a requirement for continuous  improvement that we have included in the 2025 transformation program.”  Anne Quillon, Head of Procurement and Supplier Relations  PLAYER ON THE JOB MARKET  As the bearer of a value chain of which it is the pillar, Naval Group  exercises its responsibility across its entire ecosystem.  With 90% of its added value created in France, Naval Group is a  driving force in the French naval industry and an essential player  in the vitality of the employment areas in which it operates. Its  activities generate more than 40,000 indirect jobs there and its  growth brings in its wake that of the entire naval defence sector,  that is to say that of the suppliers and subcontractors who  depend on this activity.  Naval Group is a major local customer: around 85% of its  purchases are ordered from companies located in France and  two-thirds from SMEs.  With a view to strengthening and developing the most essential  companies in its panel of suppliers, the Procurement Department   is developing its relationships with SMEs over the long term, in  line with its approach to developing sustainable procurement.  This involves guaranteeing the continuity of critical suppliers,  whose skills are unique, and encouraging them to innovate so  that they can develop their industrial performance.  This commitment is part of the SME Defence Action Pact signed  by the French Ministry of Defence and Naval Group in 2013 and  renewed in November 2020 (SME Action Pact), as well as the  SME Pact established by the French Ministry of the Economy, to  which Naval Group is a signatory to support the development of  SMEs internationally.            VII. Pillar IV: Naval Group, a responsible industrial partner  In conjunction with the French  Defence Procurement Agency  (DGA) and the General Management of Companies (DGE),  Naval Group has identified the suppliers to be supported and is  undertaking several types of action to sustain and diversify their  order book, in partnership with the suppliers concerned.  At the same time, Naval Group carries out continuous  improvement actions internally in order to best support its  supplier base. In this context, since 2020, Naval Group has  applied a reduced payment period of 30 days for SMEs and VSEs  in its general purchasing conditions.  VII.3.    NAVAL GROUP, A SOLIDARITY- BASED COMPANY  As a company in the defence sector, Naval Group is committed  to working alongside the armed forces in general and the French  Navy in particular, a stakeholder with which the group has a  special relationship.  social projects that the Bleuet de France association has been  championing since its creation in 1916 to support the needs of  current and veteran soldiers, including victims of war or acts of  terrorism.  NAVAL GROUP IS A PARTNER OF THE GRAND PRIX  DE L’ÉCOLE NAVALE  The Grand Prix de l’École Navale (GPEN), organise d for the past  20 years by the École Navale, strives to be a flagship event  in competitive sailing, aimed at young people and welcoming  participants from all backgrounds (high school and university  students, young people in difficulty, sportsmen and women  with disabilities, sailing enthusiasts, French and foreign military  personnel), driven by the values of openness, equal opportunities  and team spirit. As such, it contributes to strengthening the  relationship between the army and the nation.  Naval Group has been a partner for many years of this sporting  and community event, which promotes the values of equal  opportunities, team spirit, self-achievement and ambition, dear to  Naval Group’s employees.  PATRONAGE AND SPONSORSHIP IN THE SERVICE OF FRENCH  DEFENCE AND MARITIME HERITAGE  From 2022, Naval Group will sponsor the next Grand Prix de  l’École Navale.  Patronage and sponsorship projects carried out by Naval Group  embody the relationship between the group and its stakeholders.  In this context, Naval Group has conducted patronage or  sponsorship programs focused on three main areas, defined in  line with its communication policy: • commitment to youth: the group sponsored the annual   Armées Jeunesse award ceremony organise d by the Armed  Forces-Youth Commission. During this event, several prizes  are awarded in recognition of original projects carried out  by military units in collaboration with young people (large- scale action, memory, discovery of the armed forces, armies  and citizenship, sport, sustainable development, armies and  education);  • highlighting the history, skills and techniques of shipbuilding:  Naval Group, for the third consecutive year, sponsored the  renovation of the National Navy Museum. Once renovated, this  exceptional site will showcase nearly four hundred years of  naval innovation to future generations;  • contribute to solidarity and memorial actions in favour of the  link between the world of the armed forces and the nation: a  fundraising campaign involved employees in the financing of   P U O R G L A V A N  39  PARTNERSHIPS TO PROMOTE THE SPIRIT OF DEFENCE  Naval Group encourages and supports the commitment of  its reservist employees in the armed forced in the service of  security. In 2019, an agreement to support the operational  reserve was signed with the National Guard.  Created in 2016 following the attacks in Paris and Nice, the  National Guard aims to bring together 85,000 volunteers  (40,000 reservists from armies and units attached to the Ministry  of the Armed Forces and 45,000 reservists from the Ministry of  the Interior).  Reservist employees benefit from ten days of absence paid in  full by the group to carry out their military activities. Simple prior  notice to the employer is sufficient for periods of one to eight  days of absence. From nine to ten days, prior authorisation  is  required. These notification or authorisation  times are shortened.  In addition, Naval Group grants reservist employees the insertion  of a reactivity clause in their reserve contracts which allows the  armed forces to draft them with only 15 days’ notice.  I  I  I  1 2 0 2 T R O P E R Y T L B S N O P S E R L A C O S E T A R O P R O C  I            VII. Pillar IV: Naval Group, a responsible industrial partner  To coordinate the support agreement, a reserve officer provides  continuous internal information and ensures a constant  relationship with the National Guard.  Naval Group is thus recognised  by the French authorities as a  national defence partner.  In January 2022, Naval Group joined forces with the French  Navy, the G roupement des industries de construction et activities  navales (GICAN) and Cinav to participate in the second edition of  Fabrique Défense.  Organised by the French Ministry of the Armed Forces, the  aim of this event is to promote the wealth of professions in  the naval defence industry and its innovation capabilities,  to present the development ambitions and enhance the  attractiveness of the sector.  As during the first edition, Naval Group held a stand there to  present its activities, business lines and skills.  Round tables were organise d to encourage ideas and discussion  about major defence issues and to address topics such as  defence Europe, defence and society, innovation, industry  and technology, armed forces and intelligence capabilities,  international relations and geopolitical risks and threats.  The Naval Group stand at the  La Fabrique de la Défense event.  Sensitive to the actions carried out for the benefit of the families  of injured or dead sailors, Naval Group has been supporting  the Association pour le développement des métiers sociaux  de la Marine (ADOSM) for many years. It helps the families of  civilian and military personnel serving in the Navy when they are  experiencing serious difficulties.

Although  we of course regret this choice, after the con- siderable efforts we made to meet the mile- stones of the program, we are aware that this  decision was in no way the consequence of a  lack of performance on our part. I would also  like to acknowledge all the Naval Group employ- ees in France and in Australia who contributed  to the program as well as all our partners. Following this announcement, our priority has  been to support all those affected by this deci- sion  and  remarkable  work  has  been  done  in  France  and  in  Australia  to  find  repositioning  solutions.  MAJOR INDUSTRIAL   SUCCESSES IN FRANCE,    IN EUROPE…  2021 was particularly intensive in  terms of industrial achievements.  On  19  February,  the  Minister  of   the Armed Forces, Florence Parly,  announced  the  launch  of  the  program  for  third-generation nuclear-powered ballistic missile  submarines, the 3G SSBNs: four submarines that  will replace the current SSBNs in their mission  without interruption. Another  large-scale  program:  the  nuclear-  powered new generation aircraft carrier (PA-Ng),  which was launched at the end of 2020. The joint  venture MO Porte-Avions, which we created in  2021 with our partner Chantiers de l’Atlantique,  will allow us to conduct this exceptional program,  which has received its first preliminary design  contract from the French Defence Procurement  Agency (DGA).  SOLIDITY, PERFORMANCE AND RESPONSIBILITY  2021 was marked by the end of the Australian program but also   by major industrial successes in France and internationally. Bolstered  by its skills and an exceptional ability to innovate in order to bounce  back, our company has successfully met the challenge of moving  from resilience to performance, thanks to the three pillars that deﬁne  its strategy: France, international and innovation. Here’s how…      EDITORIAL  On the Barracuda program for nuclear attack  submarines (SSN), we continued the work that  will lead to the entry into service of the first of  the series, the Suffren, and we transferred the  Duguay-Trouin to the launching device at our  Cherbourg site, where the industrial work will be  completed on the vessel before the sea trials. Also in Cherbourg, we repaired the Perle, the  nuclear attack submarine that had suffered a  fire in 2020. In the course of this 11-month proj- ect, our teams achieved a unique technical treat:  welding the rear section of the Perle to the front  section of another submarine, the Saphir. In Octo- ber, the Perle went on to continue maintenance   1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  04  “  We have the ambition to develop  drones and autonomous systems.  Thanks to its comprehensive  business model and an ecosystem  of cutting-edge partners,  Naval Group has all the skills  for these innovative systems in  the context of naval collaborative  combat. Through our work  on drones, we will also expand  our capacities to design  and industrialise ships in a  different way.”   work in Toulon, where our teams are hard at work  to ensure its return to sea in 2023. In addition  to this technical and industrial achievement, this  disaster  represented  an  opportunity  to  make  progress with regard to the safety of our sites  and our employees, a project at the heart of the  company’s transformation.  At the European level, on 30 November in Con- carneau, we celebrated the keel-laying of the  first of the twelve minehunting vessels in the  Belgian-Dutch program, rMCM.  Also in Europe, Greece placed its trust in us: in  September, we had the honour, alongside MBDA,  of  signing  a  memorandum  of  understanding  opening negotiations to provide the Greek navy  with three frigates for defence and intervention  (FDI) and their equipment, as well as an option  on a supplementary frigate. With the FDIs, the  Greek Navy will have a state-of-the-art, high-per- formance surface fleet that is fully interoperable  with European and NATO fleets. An asset in terms  of  power  and  sovereignty  for  Greece,  which  becomes the second customer for this digital  multimission frigate, the first being the French  Navy, for which five units will be produced. European cooperation will be on the agenda for  us in 2022 with the launch of studies for the  future European corvette, the EPC, in cooperation  with Italy and Spain, as well as Greece, Denmark  and Norway. Together with our Italian partner  Fincantieri,  we  have  asked  our  joint  venture  Naviris to support this ambition.  … AND INTERNATIONALLY  In India, on 25 November, we cel- ebrated the entry into service of  the Vela, the fourth submarine in a series of six  built through transfer of technology. This follows  just a few months from the entry into service of  the Karanj, in March 2021.  In Brazil, the submarine Riachuelo will soon enter  into active service. This is the first of a series of  four submarines, built locally, on the Itaguaí naval   “   France, international and  innovation are the three pillars  of our strategy. The lintel that  rests on these pillars: trust.  The trust of our customers in  our expertise, of our employees  in our company, but also our  trust in ourselves, in our  victories and in our ability to win.”   base, an infrastructure created specifically for  this program. With 14 submarines sold around  the world, Naval Group’s Scorpène® is a bench- mark  for  conventional  submarines  for  navies  around the world. We have an excellent score in services, with 95%  of our milestones reached on time in 2021: this  includes, among others, our in-service support  and modernisation activities. On a global level,  for  surface  ships  and  submarines,  we  have  ensured fleet availability of over 90%.  intelligence and augmented reality, we provide  our customers with the long-term scientific, tech- nological and industrial capacities necessary for  their sovereignty, in France and around the world. When it comes to innovation, 2022 will see the  continuation of our investment in drones and the  autonomous systems of tomorrow that will support  combat fleets in all their missions, in particular  taking into account the seabed as a new theatre  for operations.  PERFORMANCE AND   RESPONSIBILITY   To accomplish our mission efficiently,  we must ensure our safety and the qual- ity of our achievements, but also our  social, societal and environmental responsibility.  Today, CSR is more than an advantage, it has  become a sine qua non condition. One of our  challenges for 2022 will be to move up a gear so  that our CSR projects obtain additional results.  We will also adapt our own corporate purpose,  following the collaborative work undertaken with  groups of volunteers at all our sites and in several  of our countries. We owe these CSR efforts to our customers, our  partners, our suppliers, our employees but also  to our future talent, to the youth we continue to  support by introducing them to our professions  through our teams of enthusiasts who welcome  young people for internships and work-study  programs. To convince young people to join our  teams and partners to work with us, we have to  show them that we are doing everything we can  to have a positive impact on society.  1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  05  At Naval Group, this is our ambition for the future:  to commit, together, to being a high-tech com- pany  that  is  both  efficient  and  responsible  in  serving our customers.  INNOVATION AND   TECHNOLOGY AT THE HEART   OF OUR STRATEGY  At  the  Naval  Innovation  Days  that we organised in October,  we unveiled our key innovation  projects. These projects include  the  oceanic  underwater  drone  demonstrator,  representing the autonomous capabilities that  the navies of tomorrow will have. One major tech- nological and human challenge will relate to the  acceptability and confidence in the controlled  decision-making autonomy that we will develop.

Two ocean patrol vessels  were delivered to the Argentinian  Navy, in April and then in October.  The first of two multimission frigates  with enhanced air defence capability  (FREMM DA), the Alsace, was  delivered in April. The first of  two Gowind® corvettes intended   for the United Arab Emirates was  floated in December. The preliminary  design phase for the new generation  aircraft carriers (PA-Ng) began   in March. The keel was laid for   the first frigate for defence and  intervention (FDI) and its combat  system embedded in the Panoramic  Sensors and Intelligence Module  (PSIM) was activated in December.  The end of the year was also   marked by the signing of a  memorandum of understanding   with Greece, the first country  to purchase  Belh@rra®, the export  version of the FDI.

The Minister of the Armed Forces,  Florence Parly, also announced   the notiﬁcation of the preliminary  design contract.  T  Tailored organisation to maximise  synergies At the end of 2020, the President of the  Republic launched the design of the nuclear-  powered aircraft carrier that will replace the  Charles de Gaulle when the latter reaches  the end of its life around 2038. Naval Group  and Chantiers de l’Atlantique have therefore   created a joint venture dedicated to the  program, MO Porte-Avions, to ensure the  project management of the armed vessel  (excluding boiler rooms). “This alliance will  allow  the  two  partners  to  combine  their  respective skills and experience. This is a  firmly cooperative step”, underlines Olivier  de Saint-Julien, Chair of the joint venture  MO Porte-Avions.  Well distributed tasks “Naval Group is the overall architect of the  armed vessel and responsible for the sys- tems specific to a nuclear aircraft carrier  (excluding  nuclear  boiler  rooms  proper),  explains Laurent Coudray, PA-Ng Business  Manager. That means we are responsible  for  the  implementation  of  aviation,  the   combat  system,  distributed  digital  sys- tems,  the  electrical  energy  production   system, the production of nuclear boiler  sub- assemblies, the integration of these  boilers on the ship and trials. Chantiers de   MILLION EURO  WERE INVESTED IN THE MODERNISATION OF EQUIPMENT    on the Lorient site from 2018 to 2021.      SURFACE SHIPS  “Naval Group is working  closely with Chantiers   de l’Atlantique to ensure  that the human   factor is taken into  account when reﬂecting  on the operation and  maintenance conditions   of the ship and ﬁtting   of the living quarters.   Our discussions also focus  on the environmental  aspect.”   Laurent Coudray,   PA-Ng Business Manager  1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  10  l’Atlantique is responsible for the ship’s large  platform systems: the hull, electric propul- sion, life function, manoeuvring and auxil- iary facilities, and will manage the industrial  coordination.  Finally,  TechnicAtome  is  in  charge of the nuclear boiler rooms, in con- junction with Naval Group.”   The purpose of the preliminary   design contract The PA-Ng program draws on the expertise  of almost all the Naval Group sites, which  are participating in the works carried out on  the industrial study platform in Lorient. The  preliminary design work and risk removal  studies started there at the end of March  2021. “The preliminary design means that  we can establish a repository of require- ments shared between the overall architect  and the systems and define the general  architecture of the ship and the architec- tures of the main systems necessary”, adds   SIGNATURE   OF AGREEMENTS   CREATING THE   JOINT-VENTURE   BETWEEN NAVAL GROUP   AND CHANTIERS   DE L’ATL ANTIQUE,   ON 29 MARCH 2021  IN LORIENT.  Olivier de Saint-Julien. “In particular, this  stage will allow Naval Group and Chantiers  de l’Atlantique to prepare for consulting the  equipment suppliers. Their shared goal is  to complete the preliminary design phase  in early 2023, to move on to the detailed  design phase.”   Anticipating requirements Mobilisation is gaining momentum, partic- ularly on the Nantes-Indret site, which is in  charge of the energy-propulsion system of  the future aircraft carrier. “The challenge is  the extraordinary dimensions of this system,  which means there are many technical chal- lenges to be met. The other big challenge  is the planning and the heavy workload that   awaits the site”, explains Gaëlle Kervern,  manager of the boiler room part of the pro- gram. “In addition to adapting the production  tool, we must define new manufacturing  processes and de-risk them, which we are  preparing  with  the  industrialisation  and  methods departments.” Preliminary studies  on logistical support for the PA-Ng have  also begun. “The new infrastructure needs  (basin and wharf) of the base port of Toulon  must be identified well in advance because  these  must  be  completed  and  available  before the end of 2034. In addition, the  duration of the civil engineering transfor- mation project is estimated at between four  and  five  years”,  adds  Franck  Bouffety,  Aircraft Carrier Maintenance Expert. ■  R S P ECTI  V  E  E  P  “A UNIQUE  INDUSTRIAL FEAT.”   Florence Parly, Minister of the Armed Forces  carrier is a building that projects  power, a means of intervention  and a deterrent weapon.  The challenges it brings are huge  and I know that the commitment of the industrial actors,  engineers, sailors, civil agents  and soldiers of the Ministry  of the Armed Forces who work  daily on this program will be up to the task.” Extract from the speech given in Lorient  on 29 March 2021, at the inauguration of  the study platform for the new generation  aircraft carrier (PA-Ng) bringing together  teams from Naval Group, Chantiers  de l’Atlantique and TechnicAtome.  The Minister announced the notification  of the preliminary draft contract and  attended the signing of the agreements  creating our joint-venture with Chantiers  de l’Atlantique.  “As you know better than  anyone, building an aircraft  carrier is very much a ’long  term’ adventure. For many, it is the work of  a lifetime, a passion, a unique  industrial and technical feat. Everyone here has a huge  responsibility to succeed  in this project and maintain  France’s reputation of greatness.  There is still a long way to  go until 2038, the date of entry  into active service. After this  preliminary design phase that  we have started, will come  the detailed design phase,  then the launch of construction  from 2025. The ﬁrst sea trials  will take place just eleven years  later, in 2036. And I know  we can count on you. Likewise,  you can count on the State. The State will keep its  commitments.

Their crews, made up of 44 sailors, received  training in the operation and maintenance  of their vessel from the teams at Naval Group  and Kership. “We are aware that delivering  two ships in one year is an extremely com- plex  task”,  commented  Captain  Villemur,  Head of the Argentinian Inspection Commis- sion in France. “Our thanks and gratitude  go to all the men and women of Naval Group,  Kership and Piriou and to the many other  companies, who have worked tirelessly to  achieve this feat.” The excellent 96% cus- tomer  satisfaction  rate  obtained  for  the  program  in  2021  corroborates  these  comments. “The deliveries of these two patrol boats are  essential  milestones  for  the  program,  reached on time despite the health crisis  that has marked the past two years”, explains  Jean-Claude Flandrin, Program Director. “We  are now focusing our efforts on the delivery  in April 2022 of the last of the series, which  was floated last September.”  All-terrain patrol vessels  Newly built, these second and third offshore  patrol vessels 87 offer the same advantages  as those of the first series: great endurance,  excellent seakeeping, 360° visibility from  the bridge, single mast for panoramic cov- erage of sensors and rapid implementation  of intervention boats by a double system of  ramps  at  the  stern  of  the  patrol  boat.  In  addition, they are better armed, more moto- rised, equipped with an active stabilisation  system and a bow thruster and above all ice  proven, hence adapted to navigation in the  cold waters of the Antarctic. ■  ARGENTINA ANOTHER SUCCESS FOR   ANOTHER SUCCESS FOR  NAVAL GROUP AND KERSHIP NAVAL GROUP AND KERSHIP  The second and third offshore patrol vessels (OPV) ordered  by the Argentine Navy were delivered in April and October 2021,  respectively, according to the initial schedule.  O  On-time deliveries  Under  the  contract  signed  in  2018  by  Naval Group with Argentina to supply its  navy with four multimission ocean patrol  vessels, the ARA Bouchard (formerly L’Adroit,  built by Naval Group) was delivered in 2019. The  construction  of  the  following  three  patrol vessels, with a design adapted to the  needs of the Argentinians, was entrusted  to Kership – a subsidiary of Naval Group, in  partnership with Piriou. Naval Group deliv- ered no fewer than two units this year on  the contractual dates: ARA Piedrabuena on                      F O CU  S  CS R  THE LIQUID AND SOLID  WASTE MANAGEMENT  SYSTEM of an FDI complies  with the requirements of  Marpol, the international  convention for the prevention  of pollution from ships.

C  Construction well underway… To complete the fleet of first-rate combat  ships, the contract providing for the supply  of the first of five FDIs, new highly innovative  multimission frigates, to the French Navy  was notified in 2017. The manufacture of  FDI no. 1 began in October 2019 and its keel  was laid on the Naval Group site in Lorient  on 16 December 2021.  On  this  occasion,  Pierre  Éric  Pommellet  unveiled and illuminated the first hull blocks  in construction form and powered up the  Panoramic Sensors and Intelligence Module  (PSIM), the integrated mast comprising part  of the combat system.   … with ambitious pace that has  accelerated  For the following units, while the initial plan  provided  for  deliveries  staggered  every  eighteen months, the State requested in  the spring that the second and third frigates  in the series both be delivered in 2025. A  decision that supports the activity of the  Lorient site, as highlighted by Pierre Éric  Pommellet: “The trust of the Ministry of the  Armed Forces sends a strong positive signal,  for the use and maintenance of skills, at  Naval Group as well as within its ecosystem,  subcontractors and partners, but also for  the  international  navies  which  could  be  interested in these frigates.”   Spearheading export orders  On 28 September 2021, Greece signed a  memorandum  of  understanding  with  Naval Group and MBDA opening negotia- tions to provide the Greek navy with three   FDIs,  logistics,  training,  ammunition  and  associated  maintenance,  as  well  as  an  option on a supplementary frigate. According  to the Franco-Greek agreement, these FDIs  are to be built by Naval Group in Lorient and  delivered in 2025 and 2026. “This is very  good news for Naval Group and the Lorient  shipyard, which will benefit from a planned    workload  of  at  least  five  years”,  rejoices  Pierre Éric Pommellet.  Performance, quality and safety  challenges To be able to meet this rate of orders, the  site has undergone transformation since  2018, investing heavily in its industrial tool  and pacing its organisation to improve its  competitiveness. The goal: to be able to  float two to three ships per year. Digitisation has therefore become a pro- duction accelerator. Machining and assem- bly operations and compliance checks are  now carried out using software installed on  digital tablets, which contributes to greater  control of quality and schedules. The Lorient shipyard has been able to adapt  and organise itself successfully to meet the  challenges of the acceleration requested by  France. This enabled the consolidation of  the international Belh@rra® offering, and the  means to deliver to Greece, in line with the  country’s strong desire to strengthen its navy  very quickly, the first two frigates as of 2025.  “The on-board integration and the sea trials  of  the  ship’s  various  systems  take  place  within tight deadlines, which calls for prepa- ration well in advance. For each on-board  system, the maximum number of tests are  carried out on the integration platform on  land, as early as possible in the process”,  adds Sylvain Perrier, Program Director. ■   ON 13 JANUARY 2022,     THE FRENCH MINISTER OF   THE ARMED FORCES VISITED   THE SITE IN LORIENT,     WHERE THE FDIS ARE BUILT.                    SURFACE SHIPS  TECHNOLOGIES  In early 2021, Naviris, the joint-venture formed  by Fincantieri and Naval Group, signed a memorandum  of understanding with Navantia to expand industrial cooperation  around the European Patrol Corvette (EPC) program.  The teams of the three manufacturers are working  together to imagine the offshore corvette of tomorrow.  In total, the EPC program provides for the construction  of around twenty ships for the three nations.  EPC:  STRENGTHENING EUROPEAN COOPERATION   INNOVATIVE, THE FUTURE EPCs  will be financed by the   European Defence Fund (EDF) and will allow Spain, France and   Italy, as well as other European countries that join the program,   to exercise their sovereignty and protect their interests in their   exclusive economic zone. “In 2021, we started to identify   the needs of our navies and begin work to define a first draft   of this new class of ships”, says Bruno Rattez, EPC Program   Director. “We seek to set up standards and working methods   that are innovative and common to the three countries,   with standardised interfaces for the equipment.” While the   common base for all EPCs will be as developed as possible,   each one will then be able to equip the ship according to its   doctrine and its needs. The Franco-Italian-Spanish consortium,   of which Naviris is the coordinator vis-à-vis the European Union,   submitted its proposal to the EDF on 9 December.  1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  15   THE FREMM   THE FREMM  PROGRAM  PROGRAM  CONTINUES TO  CONTINUES TO  SHOW EXCELLENT  SHOW EXCELLENT  PERFORMANCE  PERFORMANCE   In April 2021, Naval Group  delivered the Alsace,   the ﬁrst of two multimission  frigates with enhanced  air defence capability.   1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  14  D ON 16 APRIL 2021 IN TOULON, IN THE PRESENCE OF FLORENCE PARLY, THE MINISTER   OF THE ARMED FORCES, NAVAL GROUP DELIVERED THE FREMM DA ALSACE.   Delivery schedule met The delivery of the frigate Alsace to its base  port in Toulon, was made by the contractual  deadline, despite the health crisis and the  request  from  the  Organisation  for  Joint  Armament Cooperation (OCCAR) to inte- grate the latest capability developments,  particularly in the field of cyber defence,  without changing the schedule. “Between  2018 and 2020, the FREMM entered the era  of cyber surveillance and, although we were  late  getting  on  board,  we  were  able  to  quickly rise to a very advanced level of pro- tection”, confirms Nicolas Gaspard, FREMM  Program Director.   A Herculean program The frigate Alsace also benefited from the  continuous  development  intrinsic  to  the  program. From its design to its delivery, it  represented  approximately  three  million  hours of work, provided in equal parts by  Naval Group and its partners and subcon- tractors. It mobilised over a hundred differ- ent trades and called on many skills, spread   over all the group’s sites. The seventh unit  delivered to the French Navy after the frig- ate Aquitaine, in 2012, it will be followed by  the Lorraine, powered up in 2021, with deliv- ery scheduled for November 2022. In total,  the Lorient site will have built ten multimis- sion frigates!  and  in  which  the  FREMM  Provence  and  Languedoc participated within the carrier  battle group. In 2021, in order to support  the frigate Languedoc during a long-term  operation, Naval Group notably successfully  organised a short technical shutdown in  Abu Dhabi, involving a multi-speciality team  on site.  Industrial success Like her sisterships, whose architecture she  shares,  the  frigate  Alsace  incorporates  environmentally  virtuous  technologies:  hybrid propulsion, which allows her to sail  in coastal areas without polluting emissions  linked to diesel combustion, or even a treat- ment plant for liquid waste and a space for  compacting and crushing solid waste (in  accordance with regulations). From an oper- ational point of view, the performance of  the FREMM frigates in terms of anti-sub- marine  warfare  has  once  again  been  demonstrated – and praised by the US Navy  (four FREMM in two years distinguished by  the award for anti-submarine warfare excel- lence – the Hook’em Award) – in operations  such as during the “high intensity” com- bined exercise Polaris 21, which took place  at the end of November in the Mediterranean   An enhanced frigate The frigate Alsace stands apart from pre- vious units by her increased anti-aircraft  capabilities. Like her sisterships, she uses  the  most  efficient  weapon  systems  and  equipment (Herakles multifunction radar,  Aster 15 and 30 and Exocet MM 40 missiles,  MU90 torpedoes). The performance of her  combat system is reinforced by radar capa- bilities, increased communication and com- mand capabilities, a Setis® combat man- agement system, equipped with specific  air defence functions and new radar and  electro-optical fire control. ■          16  SUB-  MARINES  2 0 2 1   Support for the whole  life cycle In terms of submarine activity   at Naval Group, a highlight of 2021   will notably be the arrival of the  nuclear-powered ballistic missile  submarine (SSBN) Le Terrible at   the Brest naval base as part of its  periodic full cycle docking (FCD)   of fourteen months, the official  launch of the third-generation  ballistic missile nuclear submarine  program (3G SSBN) in Val-de-Reuil,  the entry into active service   of two Scorpène® in India, the end of  the first maintenance of the nuclear  attack submarine (SSN) Suffren   in Toulon, the departure of the SSN  Perle from Cherbourg, where it was  repaired, for Toulon, the successful  implementation of the first exercise  torpedo (F21) by the Riachuelo,   the first of the Brazilian Scorpène®,  the transfer of SSN Duguay-Trouin,  second in the Barracuda series, to its  launching device in Cherbourg etc.   1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  17  A full range   of submarines  D E R E W O P - R A E L C U N  A D U C A R R A B  ® E N È P R O C S  I  I  E L S S M C T S L L A B  I  I  )  N B S S ( E N R A M B U S  I  The best   performance for  nuclear dissuasion.

Several decades after the creation   of the nuclear deterrent force,   the keystone of French sovereignty,  2021 was marked by the launch   of a new generation of nuclear- powered ballistic missile submarines  (SSBN), the third. Hundreds of  speciﬁc skills are already mobilised,  everywhere in France.  A  A French industrial story  Symbolic in more ways than one, 2021 also  celebrated fifty years of permanent patrol  by  nuclear-powered  ballistic  missile   submarines (SSBN), in waters around the  globe. The Minister of the Armed Forces,  Florence Parly, recalled: “The success of  this oceanic component of deterrence is   first and for emost the story of exceptional  will and technological and scientific achieve- ment.” As the first of four second-generation  SSBNs retires from active service between  2030 and 2040, all who work to renew it  will  be  part  of  this  extraordinary  legacy.  Naval Group is the prime contractor for this  major program, in association with the part- ner TechnicAtome for the boiler section. We  work jointly on behalf of our contracting  authorities, the French Defence Procurement  Agency (DGA) and the Commissariat for  Atomic  Energy  and  Alternative  Energies  (CEA). More than two hundred companies  from the French naval defence industrial  ecosystem, four hundred skills and three  thousand people throughout the territory  will be involved. These include leading forg- ers Framatome and Aubert & Duval who, for  sixty years, have been supplying parts for  nuclear boiler rooms, with the support of  the entire French nuclear industrial fabric.  All  Naval  Group  sites  will  be  mobilised.   1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  19  YEARS  IN THE SERVICE OF THE FRENCH DETERRENT FORCE.   Since January 1972, Naval Group has ensured    the in-service support (ISS) of French nuclear    submarines based in l’Île Longue.

Signs of longevity  The 3G SSBN program  represents 100 million  hours of work over   the next 30 years,  including 15 million  hours of design   for 3,000 employees,  and 80 million hours   of construction for  2,000 employees,   over the long term.   The ﬁrst of the series  should be launched  during 2030-2040,  while the last of the   Le Triomphant class   is set to be withdrawn  from active service  around 2050. She and  her three sisterships  will patrol until 2080.  tubes, masts, the weapon handling system  will be produced in Angoulême-Ruelle. The  deterrent weapon system and the combat  system will be designed in Ollioules. Bagneux  will  focus  on  various  program  management activities and Brest  will contribute to the preparation  of the Services activity (logistics  and infrastructure) as well as to  the design and production of ship  modules and platform equipment.  This vast program includes a com- ponent  dedicated  to  specific  means of production (in particular  for resistant hulls in Cherbourg  and machining in Indret), which,  financed by the DGA, was con- tracted  in  February.  It  allows  Naval Group to put itself in order  to design and supply these means  and  equipment.  Infrastructure  adaptation work has begun in var- ious places, and new machines  will soon be introduced. Renewed to adapt to new threats,  the 3G SSBN will be slightly lon- ger  and  heavier  than  the  Le  Triomphant class. It will also be  more discreet, thanks to acoustic  coatings and quieter propulsion.  This means its acoustic footprint should be  no  louder  than  a  school  of  shrimp!  With  regard to its environmental footprint, the  DGA asked Naval Group to draw up an Eco- design and environmental risk management  file, the health and safety at work (HS) sec- tion of which was delivered in 2021. This  study underlines the consideration of the  risks associated with polluting discharges  and hazardous substances, in particular at  the end of the boat’s life. The challenge is,  over this long period, to be as least a burden  as possible for the future generations who  will disassemble this class of submarines.  This “extraordinary inheritance” should not  come with an inconvenience. ■  1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  20  All our sites on deck The  main  components  of  the  deterrent weapon system (gas  generators, upper closures, side  access  etc.),  weapon  launch   R S P ECTI  V  E  E  P  “OUR STRATEGY  IS CENTRED ON  SUSTAINABLE  DEVELOPMENT.”   Fabien Chêne, Sustainable Development Account Manager  at Schneider Electric.  to halve their CO2 emissions  by 2025.

A  A 2021 list that ranges from India… 2021  has  been  buzzing  with  Scorpène®  news across the globe! India has made a  name for itself with not one but two sub- marines admitted to active service in the  same year: the INS Karanj, on 10 March,  followed by the INS Vela, on 25 November.  Entirely  built  via  transfer  of  technology  (ToT) led by dedicated Naval Group and   Naval Group India teams, at the Indian ship- yard Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited  (MDL), the first four Kalvari-class subma- rines demonstrate the success of the local- isation strategy of the P75 program in India.  They  illustrate  the  success  of  the  Atmanirbhar Bharat (autonomy) of the Indian  Navy and the naval defence industry. Part  of this is due to the organisation put in place  by Naval Group’s Scorpène® department  and which, thanks to the teams deployed  on our sites, in France and locally, provide  support to export customers under technical  assistance contracts. At the same time, the  sourcing of local companies resulted in the  launch of the qualification process for the  manufacturers selected and resulted in the  awarding of the first certificates of technical  aptitude relating to the execution of special  processes, necessary for the manufacture  of Naval Group-designed spare parts.

After the delivery of the Suffren, another chapter   in the Barracuda epic began, marked by the permanent efﬁciency  required by the simultaneous construction of ﬁve other boats,  delivered at the rate of approximately one unit every two years   by the end of the decade.  E  Ensuring the naval power of France  The  SSN  Duguay-Trouin,  second  in  the  series  of  submarines  in  the  Barracuda   program, left the Laubeuf shipyard at the  Naval  Group  site  in  Cherbourg,  on  26 November 2021, for the Cachin infra- structure  launching  device.  This  transfer  symbolises  its  entry  into  the  completion  phase, before its first dockside trials. To work  on board, nearly 1500 employees and con- tractors have been trained and certified in  health,  safety  at  work  and  environment  (HS&E), nuclear safety and diving safety.  Among the most efficient in the world, the  Suffren  type  nuclear  attack  submarines   (SSN) produced under the Barracuda pro- gram will enable France to maintain its rank  as a great naval power. It is one of the flag- ship programs of Naval Group and its teams,  mobilised to meet the challenges of quality,  costs and deadlines with an extreme degree  of  care  and  completeness.  Incremental  improvement proposals have been initiated  in terms of operational capabilities in a world  in the midst of a redefining of threats.  Thanks to the experience acquired on the  first  two  submarines,  the  parallelisation   of the construction of the following units   is  optimised.  The  pace  is  picking  up  on   the sites involved in the program. At the   end of August, the closure of the rear of   the Tourville (third unit in the series of sub- marines  of  the  Barracuda  program)  was  carried out after boarding the “propulsion  system”  module  in  July.  The  “reactor  exchanger pool” module began its integra- tion process on board the De Grasse (4th  in  the  series)  at  the  end  of  December.  Assembly of the “propulsion system” and  “reactor exchanger pool” modules for the  Rubis (5th) has begun on the Nantes-Indret  site. The sections of the boiler room of the  Casabianca  (6th)  were  delivered  to  the  Laubeuf shipyard at the end of 2021 to begin  the hull equipment phase.  Ongoing maintenance  On the Services side in Toulon, the right- of-way dedicated to parking and mainte- nance  (five  quays,  three  basins  and  the  associated secret basic nuclear installation  [INBS]) of these new submarines with spe- cific dimensions and requirements is being  renovated. In January 2021, the old and the  new generations crossed paths there: the  nuclear attack submarine (SSN) Perle, for  repair, and the Suffren, for its first interme- diate maintenance period. The maintenance  tasks and the remaining on the water work   were completed there in ultra-constrained  time thanks to the extraordinary determi- nation  of  the  teams  from  Cherbourg,  Nantes-Indret and Angoulême-Ruelle, who  came to lend a hand to the teams in Toulon.  In this pivotal period with the gradual exit  from active service of one class and the  arrival of the next, Naval Group and the Fleet  Support Service (SSF) have signed a new  in-service support (ISS) agreement, which  came into effect in the summer for more  than three years. And in July, the latest ver- sions of the training platforms were received   by the customer. Since they were commis- sioned in 2015, they have enabled submarine  crews  to  practise  on  realistic  on-board  equipment to train in the operation of the  combat  system,  the  boiler  room  and  the  operation of the submarine, before their first  outings to sea.■  THE DUGUAY-TROUIN     ON ITS L AUNCHING DEVICE,   IN NOVEMBER 2021.             F O CU  S  I  N  DUS T R  Y  DID YOU SAY “INFRA”?  While ships are at the heart   of all that Naval Group does, its  internationalisation strategy has  boosted another of its activities:  infrastructure. It has even risen   to the rank of an essential  component of the offers provided  for export. The group’s ability   to develop infrastructure adapted  to ships over the entire life cycle,  from design to in-service support  (ISS) is very specific, resulting of  course from its perfect knowledge  of ships and their construction  processes. Its skills in this area  have, in recent years, been  enriched by the experience  acquired on colossal sites such   as Missiessy, the site dedicated   to the reception of Barracudas   in Toulon. The approach is   focused on optimising the  availability of ships at sea through  the efficiency of on-shore ship  support, nuclear safety and finally,  national sovereignty.                  SUBMARINES  TECHNOLOGIES  READY  FOR  CYBER!  Naval Group did not wait for a rise in cyber attacks  to equip its ships with the best means of resisting them, starting  with their design. The operational superiority of our customer  navies depends on it. This robust and reliable protection, adjusted  to the cyber needs of each customer and the type of mission  of the boats, offers modularity throughout their life cycle.    AGILE AND SEA PROVEN,  Naval Group’s cyber defence   offering is the result of constant innovation, reconciling the   imperative need for ship protection with the demands of   operational continuity and safety at sea for crews. It is based   on four axes that come in different ranges of performance,   autonomy and on-board autonomisation.   01 IDENTIFY Know the attack  scenarios and the  operation of the ship.  03 DETECT Spot an intrusion.  02 PROTECT Prevent an intrusion.  04 RESPOND Implement tools  and solutions.  This offer is accompanied by remote assistance services,   if necessary, and capacity upgrades to improve the cyber   performance of ships in service.  1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  25  1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  24  STRENGTHENING AND ACCELERATING CYBER PERFORMANCE THEE CHALLENGEE OFF ANN ENTIREE ECOSYSTEMM   In 2022, it is no longer just a  question of managing cyber risks,  but of anticipating them and,  above all, of demonstrating robust  and appropriate performance  in this area to ensure the success  of the digitisation of systems  and spaces.  C  Cybersecurity is now a major field of combat  with a constant increase in the number of  cybernetic operations conducted in opera- tional theatres and on the various players in  the ecosystem. This observation makes cybersecurity a stra- tegic issue for our customers, comparable  to the issue of the acoustic discretion of  submarines  or  electronic  warfare  that  appeared in the previous century.  Because the entire naval defence ecosystem  is  concerned  by  this  issue,  the  various  players need to organise themselves and  combine  their  efforts  to  strengthen  and  accelerate  their  performance  in  terms  of cybersecurity.  It is with the aim of supporting its cyberse- curity strategy that Naval Group co-signed  a cyber agreement in September 2019 with  the manufacturers Airbus, Ariane Group,  Dassault  Aviation,  MBDA,  Nexter,  Safran  and Thales. Among  the  aims  of  this  agreement:  to  strengthen  the  level  of  cybersecurity  of  weapon systems and the data they pro- cess or transport, as well as of information  systems and their digital ecosystems, in  the construction and maintenance phases. The first results of this alliance have made  it possible to highlight the necessary evo- lution of armament programs by considering  cybersecurity  as  a  performance  to  be  achieved, taking into account the challenges  of scalability of capabilities. ■          A range of bespoke  services to ensure the  operational availability of  surface ships and submarines.

More than 5,000 employees,   in France and abroad, follow the  same course: guarantee the best  availability of the vessel entrusted   to them, provide the crew with   a boat at the highest level of  performance, take into account  environmental issues, both   at sea and in basins. Major maintenance of a nuclear-  powered ballistic missile submarine  (SSBN), modernisation of La Fayette  class frigates, repair of the nuclear  attack submarine (SSN) Perle: in  2021, the Brest, Cherbourg and  Toulon sites were the scene of  exceptional – and in some cases  unprecedented – work carried out  within the framework of national  programs. Carried out in  collaboration with our partners   and calling on the skills spread   over all of our sites, we have seen   all the know-how of Naval Group,   as prime contractor, expressed  there, but also a tremendous  collective momentum based on the  strong commitment of its employees  alongside its customers and partners.                  SERVICES  NUCLEAR-POWERED BALLISTIC MISSILE   SUBMARINE (SSBN) LE TERRIBLE  AN EXEMPLARY AND  EXCEPTIONAL PROJECT Le Terrible, the newest of the four French SSBNs,   joined the Brest naval base in January for its ﬁrst   full cycle docking (FCD). As overall prime contractor,   Naval Group took over responsibility for the submarine   in November 2020. Project management is provided   by the French Navy’s Fleet Support Service (SSF).   A major and exceptional project in more ways than one.  T   The  latest  of  four  French  Triomphant-class  nuclear-  powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBN), Le Terrible  joined the Brest naval base in early January 2021 for its  first major refit. This major maintenance should restore  the SSBN, which entered active service in 2010, to its  full operational potential for the next ten years. The trans- fer of Le Terrible occurred after two major preparatory  operations – the removal of weapons and fuel elements  from the nuclear boiler room – carried out at the Île Longue  submarine base, the home port of the French SSBNs.  The main work concerns the maintenance of the hull and  structures, energy and propulsion, diving safety, platform   1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  29  MAJORS PROGRAMS  FOR IN-SERVICE SUPPORT (ISS) IN FRANCE    AND INTERNATIONALLY.      F O CU  S  CS R  LE TERRIBLE’S FULL CYCLE  DOCKING (FCD) has placed an  emphasis on environmental care from  its start: at the Île Longue naval base,  the wash water from the SSBN hull  was treated before being discharged  into the natural environment.  In Brest, in basin 8, the focus is  prevention of accidental spills and  the immediate intervention of teams  in the event of a spill. Particular  attention is paid to waste recycling  and recovery. In addition, the Brest  site signed the Tomorrow climate  commitment charter with Brest  Métropole in 2021. This charter is  structured around five points: - energy savings and switching   to renewable energy; - other forms of travel; - sustainable eating; - reducing and recovering waste; - raising awareness and instigating   behavioural change.

An extraordinary industrial challenge At the Brest naval base, basin 8 was the scene  of exceptional activity throughout 2021 for  several reasons: first full cycle docking (FCD)  of an SSBN armed with M51 missiles, certain  operations concerning the deterrent weapon  system are unprecedented. In addition, the  significant scope of the works (450 change  orders), their implementation under health  protocol  and  the  particularly  tight  dead- lines of this FCD – it has been reduced to  24 months – constitute a real technical and  human challenge. For Naval Group, the stakes  are high since it is a question of enabling the   R S P ECTI  V  E  E  P  “I WANT TO  COMMEND THE  EFFORTS MADE BY  THE NAVAL GROUP  TEAMS.”    Jean-Yves Bruxelle, Director of SSF Brest  “In the FCD of Le Terrible, we are tackling three major  challenges together. The ﬁrst relates to the quality  of the service, which, given the complexity of the site,  is expected to be of the highest standard.  This means that all of us must learn from previous FCD in order  to progress. The second challenge is, of course, safety.  Prevention, detection, ﬁre safety: we are doing everything  to control these risks. This is a constant effort, vigilance cannot  be relaxed. I want to commend the effort made by the Naval Group teams that we are supporting with this key matter.  The third challenge, and deﬁnitely not the easiest one, is  the particularly tight deadline for this FCD, because it must  meet the schedule requirements of the Cœlacanthe program,  the oceanic component of the deterrent. I would also like  to highlight the commitment of all the players who are working  collectively for the success of this extraordinary program.”  French Navy to ensure the permanence at  sea of nuclear deterrents and thus to respect  the schedule of the Cœlacanthe program.  Since the beginning of the year, at the Brest  naval base, but also at the Nantes-Indret,  Angoulême-Ruelle and Ollioules sites, the  Naval Group teams - and alongside them  those of 45 companies in the Grand Ouest  region – embarked on a real race against  time to deliver a fully operational SSBN to  the French Navy at the end of 2023.  Security and quality at the heart   of our actions “This race against time can only be won by  a close-knit collective. And for it to be able  to express itself fully, it needs a solid foun- dation: security and quality are the pillars.  This is also the foundation on which we build  a relationship of trust with our customer day  after day”, explains Laurent Mocard, Program  Director. Relying on past experience to prog- ress, aiming for the highest level in terms  of prevention, maintaining effort over time:  on the construction site, risk management  is everyone’s business. Reinforcement of  fire safety protocols, new system for secur- ing evacuations, regular checks set up with  the SSF: we have learnt our lessons from  the past. On the quality side, the FCD of  Le Terrible demonstrates the results of the  quality action plan launched by the Services  department in 2020 to ensure work is “done  right the first time.” These efforts are bearing  fruit, as the 2021 milestones were achieved  in line with the provisional schedule. At the  end of the work, scheduled for 2022, the  SSBN was taken back to its operational base  for the reloading of the core and the restarting  of the facilities. The sea trials will complete  this extraordinary industrial adventure before  Le Terrible returns to its operational cycle. ■  1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  31      SERVICES  DISASSEMBLY,   THE LAST STAGE OF  THE LIFE CYCLE Final odyssey for Le Foudroyant: on 9 September, the hull   of the ﬁrst generation French nuclear-powered ballistic missile  submarine (SSBN) entered form 5 at the Cherbourg site to   be disassembled. This new project is part of the French Navy’s  ex-SSBN disassembly program: an unprecedented program  launched in 2016 that demonstrates Naval Group’s expertise   in the last stage of the life cycle of ships.  1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  32  O  On  9  September,  the  hull  of  the  former  SSBN Le Foudroyant, the third in series of  the  five  first-generation  French  SSBNs,  entered form 5 at the Cherbourg site to be  completely disassembled. Launched in 1971,  in service from 1974 to 1998, Le Foudroyant  is  therefore  entering  the  fifth  and  final   phase of its life cycle. Following the former   Le Tonnant and the former L’Indomptable  – disassembled between September 2018  and August 2021 – the entry into basin 5 of  this third hull (120 metres long, 6,000 tonnes)  kicks  off  a  new  project  and  marks  the  beginning of a new stage in the disassembly   program for the French former SSBNs. The  contract had been notified to Naval Group  by the French Defence Procurement Agency  (DGA) in 2016. Veolia and NEOM (a subsidiary  of Vinci Construction France) are the two main  partner companies of Naval Group, prime  contractor for all operations. “Naval Group  is  proud  to  continue  with  its  partners  a  completely new program in France”, says  Olivier Lezin, Program Director.  Two former SSBNs disassembled   in less than three years On the strength of the feedback from the  first two hulls, employees and subcontrac- tors will therefore carry out disassembly  and depollution operations for around six- teen months within an installation classified  for  the  protection  of  the  environment.  A  project that continues to be placed under  the sign of safety and respect for the envi- ronment, as had already confirmed the audit   carried out by the French Association for  Standardisation (Afnor) at the start of the  year. The shared objective for all disassem- bled submarines is to recover over 87.5% of  their solid mass. In the case of the former   L’Indomptable, whose disassembly was com- pleted in August, this objective was excee- d ed, as almost 92% of the solid mass of the  ship (i.e. 5,500 tonnes) has integrated recy- cling circuits. “A rate that improves from one  vessel to the next, as we improve our means  for recycling materials. Moreover, while the  contractual deadline for a project is eighteen  months,  we  complete  it  in  sixteen,”  adds  Olivier Lezin. From 2023, the hulls of the  former Le Terrible and the former L’Inflexible  – the last two first-generation SSBNs – will  follow on to basin 5. Their disassembly will  be completed in 2026, the year in which a  page in the history of French nuclear deter- rence will have definitely turned. ■  IN 2016, NAVAL GROUP     L AUNCHED THE DISASSEMBLY   PROGRAM FOR THE FORMER   FIRST-GENERATION   NUCLEAR-POWERED BALLISTIC   MISSILE SUBMARINES (SSBN)     AT ITS CHERBOURG SITE,     THE FINAL STAGE IN THE LIFE     OF THESE FIVE FORMER     FRENCH NAVY SUBMARINES.      SERVICES  THE COURBET     ENDED ITS   TECHNICAL   SHUTDOWN     IN JULY 2021,     IN LINE WITH     THE SCHEDULE.  1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  34  LA FAYETTE FRIGATES   THE CHALLENGES OF MODERNISATION  THE CHALLENGES OF MODERNISATION   Toulon naval base, Castigneau basin: activity is in full swing on the site for   the modernisation of the La Fayette-class frigates (FLF). Signed in 2017, the contract  covers the modernisation of three of the ﬁve French stealth frigates commissioned  between 1996 and 2001. 2021 saw the end of the technical shutdown of FLF Courbet   and the basin entry of FLF La Fayette: an incredible year!  E  Ollioules  and  Saint-Tropez,  Naval  Group  teams have worked to restore the ship to  its potential for the decade to come. The  main changes concern the hull, the combat  system and the control of the platform. One  condition, however: each boat must return  to its operational cycle as quickly as possi- ble. It’s official: the schedule will be tight!  Especially since, in parallel with the mod- ernisations  planned  under  the  contract,  in-service support (ISS) operations will be  carried out in partnership with Chantiers de  l’Atlantique, for which Naval Group is the  prime contractor.  Extending the life of ships: this is the pur- pose of the mid-life modernisation program  for three La Fayette-class frigates, boats  that were designed in the 1990s. From bow  to  stern,  all  sections  of  the  frigate  are  impacted. Significant work which, at the  same time, gives the frigates new capabil- ities. Design and integration studies, system  development and equipment manufacturing,  site preparation: from 2017 to 2020, in Brest,  Nantes-Indret, Angoulême-Ruelle, Toulon,   Flawless mobilisation The first of the frigates to be in technical  shutdown, the Courbet, entered the basin  in October 2020. “Given the volume of work  and the very tight schedule, the activity on  the site reached an exceptional density, with  at times 250 people on board on a single  day. An important co-activity that had to  be  organised  to  guarantee  everyone’s  safety”,  explains  Jean-Michel  Coquelle,  Program Director. Challenge met. On 23 July   2021, nine months after the start of work  and  in  accordance  with  the  provisional  schedule, the end of the technical shutdown  of the Courbet came to an end. A success  crowned a few weeks later by the successful  firing of an M3 missile from the Sadral air  defence  system,  a  new  combat  system  capability. “Completing such a major project  in such a short time was a real challenge.  It was very difficult but we persevered and  we  are  proud  of  what  we  have  accom- plished”,  adds  Jean-Michel  Coquelle.  In  mid-September,  the  La  Fayette  frigate  entered the Castigneau basin: a new project  that had to be prepared and started while  the work on the Courbet was not yet fin- ished. Here again, the teams did not waver!  For this second frigate, the project benefits  from valuable feedback from the Courbet,  allowing progress to be made quickly with  the goal to return the La Fayette frigate with  its new capabilities to the French Navy in  the summer of 2022. ■  REPAIRED,  REPAIRED,  PERLE  THE PERLE THE  BACK IN  BACK IN  TOULON  TOULON   On 31 October 2021, after nine  months of work in Cherbourg,   the nuclear attack submarine (SSN)  Perle returned to Toulon. The repaired   SSN with the bow of the former  Saphir returned to the basin where   it went back into its full cycle   docking (FCD) works that had been  interrupted by a ﬁre in June 2020.  SERVICES  T  This is an unprecedented operation carried  out by Naval Group teams to repair the SSN  Perle, the front part of which had been dam- aged by a fire in June 2020. Shortly after the  incident, the expert studies carried out by  Naval Group teams and shared with experts  from  the  French  Defence  Procurement  Agency (DGA) concluded that it was possible  to repair the Perle by replacing the front part  with that of her sistership, the former Saphir   – decommissioned in 2019. The Minister of  the  Armed  Forces,  Florence  Parly,  then  announced in October 2020 her decision to  launch the repair site. Prepared and installed  on the launching system of the Cherbourg  shipyard, the two SSNs were cut in February  and March 2021. Preparation work for the  joining was carried out on the two open sub- marines until April. Then came the welding  and connection operations following which  the Perle saw its length increase by a little  over one metre due to the integration of an  area for connecting the electrical cables.  Since November, work on the submarine has  continued at the Toulon naval base, within  fully renovated infrastructures to accommo- date Barracuda-class SSNs. Works that are  set to last eleven months and which include  in particular the operations to be carried out  on the nuclear boiler room and on the plat- form, where some 10,000 pieces of equip- ment must be reassembled and then put  back into operation. The return of the Perle  to the operational cycle is scheduled for the  first half of 2023. ■             F O CU  S  P  ROJ E C T  STARTED IN CHERBOURG IN  JANUARY 2021, THE PROJECT  LASTED NINE MONTHS   and involved around a third   of the submarine’s installations.  The operation represented  250,000 hours of industrial work  in the first half of 2021, on top   of 100,000 hours of study.   A total of 300 people were  mobilised.  APRIL 2021: INSTALL ATION OF THE FRONT   SECTION OF THE SAPHIR.                    SERVICES  TECHNOLOGIES  Increase the availability of ships, improve the autonomy  of the crews and provide them with support at any time  and in any place: these are the objectives of the i-maintenance  and remote assistance services offered by Naval Group  to its French and international customers and developed,  for remote assistance, in partnership with MBDA.  I-MAINTENANCE AND REMOTE  ASSISTANCE   RESPONDING TO VESSEL AVAILABILITY ISSUES   In 2021, Naval Group and MBDA combined their know-how to offer   the French Navy a secure multimedia communication system linking   the ship to its shore support. This remote assistance service allows   the crew to dialogue in complete confidentiality and in real time   with both State experts and industrial experts to help with diagnosis   in the event of damage, to provide more autonomy to sailors in charge   of maintenance and allow them to prepare for the next maintenance   period. Its deployment began on the multimission frigates (FREMM)   and the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier as well as within the Fleet   Support Service (SSF) in Toulon and the one in Brest and the industrial   sites of MBDA and Naval Group. For its French and international   customers, Naval Group has developed the Intelligence Maintenance   System, which offers three services based on a function of recording   and analysis of ship data: system monitoring, anticipation of damage   and problem solving assistance. The objective is twofold: in addition   to switching from a systematic maintenance plan to a logic of   maintenance as needed and at the right time - which would increase   the availability of ships - i-maintenance aims to improve the autonomy   of crews, a common request from customers.   1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  37  1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  36  CHARLES DE GAULLE   AIRCRAFT CARRIER.  F O CU  S  P  ROJ E C T  A TWO-PART TECHNICAL  SHUTDOWN:  - preventive maintenance work,  in particular on the nuclear boiler  rooms, repairs on the machine  lifts and on several aircraft  installations, which underwent  heavy used during the  three and a half months of  the Clemenceau mission; - work to improve the living  conditions of the crew:  reorganisation of the  stations, modernisation of  the “hygiene” areas and  redesigned catering spaces.  AIRCRAFT CARRIER NAVALL GROUPP AIRCRAFTT CARRIERR  ATT WORKK FORR THREEE MONTHSS  OFF TECHNICALL SHUTDOWN  July, August and September: at the Toulon naval base, the three summer  months saw the technical shutdown of the aircraft carrier  Charles de Gaulle, returning from mission. Maintenance of installations,  repairs and modiﬁcation of living areas on board: the program was  dense but the operations were all carried out on time and successfully.  O  On 5 July, just back from the Clemenceau  mission, the Charles de Gaulle entered a  technical shutdown in the Vauban area of  the Toulon naval base. On the schedule for  this three-month technical shutdown, for  which Naval Group is the prime contractor:  preventive maintenance work on installa- tions and repairs, as well as the continuation  of major work undertaken in 2019 for the  improvement and adaptation of living areas  on board. A dense schedule in a tight time- frame, and still in a complex health context.  Coming to lend a hand, employees from the   Brest, Nantes-Indret and Angoulême-Ruelle  sites joined the Toulon teams to carry out  engineering studies, provide expertise on  propulsion  and  maintenance  work  on  machine lifts. “Despite its density, this tech- nical shutdown was carried out masterfully  and in complete safety by the Naval Group  teams, who knew how to capitalise on les- sons from previous experience, and pre- pared and organised the work with the State  bodies. The synergy between the industrial  teams and the crew and the mutual trust  also contributed to this success. In opera- tional terms, this made it possible to ensure  the ambitious ramp-up of the aircraft carrier  from the end of the summer”, says Captain  Sébastien  Martinot,  the  aircraft  carrier’s  commander.  A  few  weeks  after  the  end  of the technical shutdown, the Charles de  Gaulle took part in the high-intensity Polaris  21 exercise: “The ship met the operational  needs  and  the  readiness  of  the  aircraft  installations, again in high demand, was up  to par!” Captain Martinot added. ■          - EQUIP MEN TS  2 0 2 1   In the ﬁeld of  equipment, as in other  ﬁelds, Naval Group  responds to a vocation: design, develop, innovate, integrate  and maintain the most complex  products to contribute to the  operational performance of fleets  and support the sovereignty of  nations at sea.  Our innovative range of equipment   is supported by three industrial   sites in France: Angoulême-Ruelle,  Nantes-Indret and Cherbourg.  1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  39  A full range of  systems designed to ensure   the security and control   of surface ships and  submarines in combat.  ® R E V L Y S  ® É H A M A S  Vertical missile   launch systems.

O  One of Naval Group’s strengths is its ability,  beyond the delivery of armed ships, to offer  and design stand-alone naval equipment  and systems for international navies. From  this posture emerges a range of cutting-  edge equipment and very high-tech sys- tems.  Example:  the  British  BAE  Systems  relies  on  Naval  Group  for  the  propulsion  system of the T26 frigates which will equip  the  British  Royal  Navy  as  well  as  the  Australian and Canadian navies. MBDA also  equips  the  Italian  multimission  frigates  (FREMM),  the  future  multimission  patrol  boats (PPA) as well as the corvettes sold to  the  Qatari  navy  with  our  vertical  launch  module Sylver®.  Performance, innovation,  competitiveness Our offer includes high-performance, high- tech equipment, such as Sylver® vertical  launch systems, Samahé® helicopter han- dling systems (landing grids for landing in  complete safety), hoistable masts that raise  the sensors of submarines during periscopic  immersion as well as shaft lines and reducers  which ensure the connection between the  engine and the thruster. Also in our offer,  gun tubes for submarines, torpedo tubes  for  surface  ships  as  well  as  sea  water   BUSINESS  INTERNATIONAL   EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER  AND INTEGRATOR  Solidly anchored in its role as an equipment supplier serving international   customers, Naval Group designs, develops, puts into service and  maintains equipment of a very high technical and technological level,   even integrating them into armed ships not designed or manufactured   by Naval Group. This is a key part of our offer to export customers.  exchangers, which contribute to the per- formance of ships and submarines in many  areas, from acoustic discretion to cooling  of embedded systems. Marketed as stand  alone  with  the  support  of  Naval  Group  experts, they are integrated into ships sup- plied by other manufacturers.  Three equipment sites Naval Group relies on three sites to offer  navies the most innovative, efficient and   competitive equipment: Angoulême-Ruelle,  Nantes-Indret and Cherbourg. The Nantes- Indret  site  provides  propulsion  systems:  nuclear propulsion for the Barracuda pro- gram,  for  the  third-generation  nuclear-  powered ballistic missile submarine program   (3G SSBN) and the new generation aircraft  carrier program (PA-Ng). It also provides  equipment  for  conventional  propulsion:  defence  and  intervention  frigates  (FDI)   program, Gowind® corvettes, Scorpène®   1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  41  SYLVER® LAUNCHERS  IN OPERATION AROUND THE WORLD.

Angoulême-Ruelle specialises  in strategic equipment for combat systems  and military ship platforms. Since 2019, the  site has had an Innov’Factory which instils  a strong culture of innovation and increases  its ability to imagine new solutions to equip  naval forces. The expertise of Naval Group’s  equipment sites is illustrated by numerous  successes abroad. In addition to supplying  shaft lines to Britain’s BAE Systems for the  British Royal Navy’s T26 frigates (design in  Nantes-Indret  and  manufacturing  in  Angoulême-Ruelle), the relationship with  MBDA has only grown stronger over time.  Started in the 1990s as part of the Horizon  program,  with  the  supply  of  60  Sylver®  modules for French, Italian and British frig- ates,  it  continues  with  the  construction,  installation and assistance of 24 vertical  launch modules at on board Italian multi- mission frigates (FREMM), 10 modules for  multimission patrol boats and 10 modules  for Qatari corvettes, a program that confirms  Angoulême-Ruelle’s equipment manufac- turing capabilities internationally.  Cutting-edge  equipment Technicality,   high performance,  ease of use and  competitiveness  characterise   our autonomous  equipment and   our systems.   All contribute to  improved operational  performance of  platforms and crews  and give ﬂeets   a decisive strategic  and operational  advantage.  The Sylver® vertical launching system offers  high reliability (over 12,000 hours), requires  limited maintenance and entails a low cost  of ownership. It allows surface ships to fire  a wide variety of missiles, including self- defence, tactical and long-range missiles.  A perfect illustration of very high naval tech- nology applied to equipment and capable of  meeting the needs of the most demanding  customers at any stage of the value chain.  UK Sylver® upgrade 2021 was an opportunity to give the Royal  Navy’s Sylver® launchers a second life. This  equipment increased the performance of  the frigate Duncan for years and, in 2021,  the time had come for its overhaul. To pre- pare for this in-service support (ISS) phase,  the experts at the Angoulême-Ruelle site  first established a diagnosis before carrying  out  the  necessary  work.  What  was  the  objective? Restoring the original abilities  and  properties  of  Sylver®.  According  to  Florence Gaches, Product Support Manager  at  MBDA,  the  operation  was  a  success  thanks in particular to the spirit of cooper- ation between manufacturers and the pro- fessionalism of the teams (see inset). ■  1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  42  R S P ECTI  V  E  E  P  “A REAL  CONSIDERATION  OF THE NEEDS  EXPRESSED.”   Florence Gaches, Product Support Manager at MBDA  “The diagnostic phase went  smoothly and without a hitch,  thanks in particular to a real  consideration of the needs  expressed, the excellent  preparation of the teams and  a perfectly orchestrated  distribution of tasks.” This type of intervention is set to become  more important in the years to come, with Naval Group  being called on more and  more to ensure the ISS of its  equipment. It is hardly surprising, then, to learn that 180 Sylver®   are now in place on ﬂeets in  operation around the world. At the end of 2022, all French  FREMM frigates should be equipped with it.  OUR INDUSTRIAL   OUR INDUSTRIAL  TOOL GETS   TOOL GETS  A MAKEOVER A MAKEOVER Since 2017, Naval Group has invested  heavily in renewing and modernising   its industrial facilities wherever the group  operates, resulting in sites that are   better equipped to meet the needs of   their customers. From Nantes-Indret to  Angoulême-Ruelle, 2021 news summary.  A  Angoulême-Ruelle sustains   its strategic industrial resources Angoulême-Ruelle has two new industrial  machining facilities that are unique in France  and rare in Europe. Their promise? Provide  machining capacity for shaft lines over the  long term, prepare for the future and opti- mise industrial performance to safeguard  the production of this critical equipment for  ship propulsion. Specifically, the new milling  lathe combines the actions of turning the  barrel and boring the cakes originally carried  out separately, which limits movement and  adjustment times.  In addition, it gives us the ability to machine  shaft  lines  up  to  25  metres  long  and  40 tonnes (compared to 22 metres long and  30 tonnes today). The second machine is  a long-body boring machine that can drill  the  inside  of  shaft  lines  to  a  depth  of  25 metres. Both production means have  been tested and will be fully operational by  summer 2022.  1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  43  room for the prefabrication of nuclear boiler  system pipes. The site’s production capacity  has jumped from 2,000 pipes per year to  7,000 pipes per year, with the possibility of  increasing to 10,000 pipes per year as part  of new programs (3G SSBN and PA-Ng). On  the planning side, the goal is to reduce the  manufacturing cycle for one pipe to 12 days,  compared with the previous 50 days. On the  financial side, the goal is to reduce manu- facturing costs by around 40%. Submarines  5 and 6 from the Barracuda program will  benefit from these new capabilities.  Digitalised processes Another aspect of the industrial facility’s  upgrade is the increasing use of digital tools  in the workshops, resulting in better com- pliance monitoring, improved quality and  shorter execution times. Of particular note:  augmented reality is an asset for de-risking  certain assembly operations (seating, pipe  inspection etc.). ■  Modernisation of the Nantes-Indret site Orion is the new tertiary building at Nantes- Indret, which will house engineers, IT spe- cialists and support teams in its three wings  as of 2022. In total, more than 600 people  will enjoy Orion’s modern architecture, its  8,500 m2 of space, its innovative modular  layout and its sustainable materials, all of  which reflect its responsible approach. All  of this serves to provide new ways of work- ing, designing and innovating, to better meet  the needs of both French and foreign clients.  In 2019, a decision was made to competi- tively re-insource the piping activity at the  Indret site. Previously spread amongst the  Indret, Cherbourg and Lorient sites, as well  as a few subcontractors, these activities  are now carried out independently in Indret  in a modern, digital factory. Commissioned  in 2021, the pipe and prefabrication factory  (known as the UTP) is intended to supply  all the pipes in the propulsion energy sector  for new submarines and those undergoing  maintenance.  Established  on  an  area  of  2,500 m2 and built with an investment of  11 million euro, the factory is equipped with  three electric bending machines, two heat  treatment facilities, a pickling and passiv- ation facility, an X-ray booth and a clean           EQUIPMENTS  FULL CYCLE DOCKING (FCD) OF LE TERRIBLE HUMAN COMMITMENT   AT ITS PEAK  An extraordinary operation, the FCD of the nuclear-powered ballistic missile  submarine (SSBN) Le Terrible will require hundreds of people to mobilise over a period  of 14 months to restore her to full power after ten years serving French sovereignty  at sea (see page 29, Services chapter). This FCD has also involved the expertise of  Naval Group’s Equipment business. The fourth of the Le Triomphant class, equipped  with 16 M51 nuclear missiles, Le Terrible underwent a major reﬁt in early 2021.  In 2022, it will emerge from this refurbishment more powerful than ever.  1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  44  W  While the need to carry out major shutdowns  to maintain and upgrade fleets is unavoid- able, the downside is that vessels will be  unavailable to navies for several months.  Respecting the schedule for an operation  as major as an FCD is therefore a prerequi- site. An extremely careful preparation and  planning phase is essential to ensure the  timely availability of teams, equipment and  materials at each stage of the FCD. When  the FCD of Le Terrible (or “major refit” in the  language of the Navy) is mentioned, there  is no shortage of superlatives.  The figures speak for themselves: 2.5 million  hours of work, more than 900 people, nearly  45 subcontractors involved, 300 modifica- tions carried out, 40,000 pieces of equip- ment  dismantled  and  inspected  in  the  Naval Group workshops! Not to mention that   SSBNs are among the most complex vessels  in the world. With a goal of being at sea  365 days a year, 24 hours a day, these high- tech  gems  guarantee  French  maritime  sovereignty.  Committed expert teams Le Terrible’s FCD has mobilised Naval Group  sites in Brest, Angoulême-Ruelle, Nantes- Indret  and  Ollioules  (near  Toulon)  sites.  Angoulême-Ruelle, in particular, came into  play at the end of November 2020 when it  took charge of the maintenance of more  than 200 pieces of equipment, the most  significant of which include the masts and  the 16 upper closures located on the top of  the submarine’s hull.  The  operation  proved  to  be  particularly  complex and demanding due to the weight  of each closure (nearly 11.5 tonnes) and to  the fact that they are critical to the subma- rine’s diving safety. It required perfect coor- dination over several weeks, with the upper  closures being transported to the site two  at a time for two months. After unloading  and placing the closures on blocks, the team  started  the  refitting  operations  before  beginning  the  repair  phase  of  about  100 parts for each of the 16 closures.  Once the parts had been reassembled, the  teams  proceeded  with  adjustments  and  functional tests. In total, each of the 16 clo- sures  required  four  weeks  of  work  and  involved  a  team  of  12  millwrights  and  hydraulic engineers to complete the refitting  of the 16 closures and the 80 cylinders. ■  THE NUCLEAR-POWERED BALLISTIC MISSILE SUBMARINE     (SSBN), LE TERRIBLE.      EQUIPMENTS  TECHNOLOGIES  The result of a partnership between Naval Group  and the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, supported by a consortium  of companies led by Naval Group, the Training Centre 4.0  collaborative project proposes the development and  implementation of an innovative training system, particularly  for civil and military naval manufacturers.  INNOVATING  FOR THE  FUTURE OF  THE MARITIME  INDUSTRY   RENOWNED FOR BEING INNOVATIVE  and highly   export-oriented, the French naval and nautical industry   has achieved many successes throughout the world.   On the other hand, it is facing a significant need for   manpower and new skills. As such, a joint initiative has   been created between a consortium of companies   led by Naval Group and the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region,   which aims to establish training courses based on   new learning methods, including immersive simulation   training. These new technologies and ways of learning   are gradually being introduced into Naval Group’s   simulators for its clients. A concrete example: the vessel   discovery and facility operation simulators developed   for the rMCM mine countermeasures contract for   the Belgian and Dutch navies.  1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  47  NANTES-INDRET ALSO WELCOMED   28 AIRBUS EMPLOYEES FOR A PERIOD   OF ONE YEAR IN VARIOUS   DEPARTMENTS: PRODUCTION,   PERFORMANCE, SUPPLY CHAIN ETC.   ON 23 NOVEMBER 2021, AT THE   NANTES-INDRET SITE, NAVAL GROUP’S   TEAMS THANKED THE AIRBUS   EMPLOYEES WHO HAD COME TO HELP   THEM FOR A YEAR.  1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  46  INDUSTRIALISTS: SHARING SKILLS INDUSTRIALISTS: SHARING SKILLS  Solidarity among industrialists is a reality, and is the result of voluntary  commitment. Naval Group has put this commitment into practice  through a one-year loan of employees, allowing 16 expert mechanics  from the aeronautical industry to be welcomed to Cherbourg, a site  specialising in submarines.   F  From one industry to another, the skills are  similar… and shared. Working together with  Naval  Group  professionals,  16 Airbus  mechanics from Nantes have been contrib- uting to Naval Group’s submarine assembly  and  integration  site  in  Cherbourg  since  1 March 2021. For the Barracuda program,  Airbus mechanics have joined the autono- mous rear, front and middle production units  alongside the Cherbourg production teams.  Effective collaboration The skill combination of electricians from the  naval defence industry and mechanics from  the aeronautical industry made it possible  to install many parts of the submarine. In  particular, two Airbus mechanics contributed  to the assembly of “penetrations” on the front  bulkhead of the cofferdam (double bulkhead   surrounding the nuclear boiler system) of the  fourth Barracuda series, the De Grasse sub- marine. The front cofferdam has nine elec- trical penetrations, which ensure the safety  of people thanks to their neutron-absorbing  material composition, which absorbs radio- activity and limits radiation from the boiler  system.  During  this  experiment,  the  Naval Group and Airbus employees were also  able to share information on their respective  operating and management methods: a rich  exchange from which each party will benefit  in the future.  Positive feedback Although  particularly  delicate  given  the  safety requirements inherent to the nuclear  environment, the penetrations were suc- cessfully assembled. The many parts that  make up each penetration were assem- bled and installed in accordance with the  rules of the trade by Naval Group’s elec- tricians and Airbus’s mechanics, with all  the requirements and compliance checks  specific to Naval Group. The feedback from  Naval Group’s teams has been extremely  positive, as Airbus’s mechanics helped the  assembly process run smoothly and were  reliable and speedy in their operations. ■          SYS-  TEM S  1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  49  2 0 2 1   In the naval defence  world, technologies   are evolving rapidly   along with threats, pervading   and subtle, leading to new  capability requirements.  Anticipating the major changes   to come, in 2021 Naval Group  pursued its strategy as a systems  architect and integrator, able   to optimise military capabilities  and shared features between  different systems and vessels,   and to incrementally integrate  existing and future innovations. The role is in line with the   group’s ambitions and know-how,   as a leader in the design and  development of integrated   vessel systems and capable   of bringing together all of its  industrial stakeholders around   a structured vision shared   with the contracting parties.      SYSTEMS  MEXIQUE  1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  51  AT THE DAWN OF A NEW ERA  SYSTEMS    An essential component of the group’s new construction   and services offer in both France and abroad, the systems activity deﬁnes   and produces, based on the client’s needs, the architecture standards   for the submarine and surface ship systems that support today’s   military capabilities, as well as the innovations that will meet future needs.  C  Convergence at all levels A change in operating methods is under way in navies  around the world. Operations are now conducted in a  collaborative way among several vessels and in the con- text  of  increased  interoperability:  the  ship’s  combat  system is part of a more comprehensive system aimed  no longer at defending the individual ship, but the naval  force as a whole. More complex but more efficient, and  better able to rapidly accommodate future capability  and technological developments, the naval force combat  system  offers  modular  and  coherent  solutions  while  optimising the investments of navies around the world.  YEARS  THIS IS THE DURATION OF THE COMMITMENT MADE    BY NAVAL GROUP AND THE FRENCH STATE IN 2020:    together, they will merge submarine   combat systems by 2034.      SYSTEMS  Tested and adopted!  The collaborative   naval threat detection  watch is the ﬁrst  example of a  collaborative combat  capability within   the naval force combat  system and the ﬁrst  cross-cutting   feature implemented   on the Setis 3.0  platform. Successfully  tested in 2021, by 2023   it will equip the French  Navy’s ﬁrst-rate ships:  multimission frigates  (FREMM) and frigates  for defence and  intervention (FDI).  Capability  evolutions  are  developed  and  incorporated once in a product line and then  rolled out as many times as necessary within  a  naval  force,  integrating  the  associated  technological  innovations  throughout  the  process. Derived from the Barracuda nuclear  attack  submarine  (SSN)  combat  system,  which currently operates the most mature  version,  Sycobs  3.0  will  be  rolled  out  on  second-generation nuclear-powered ballistic  missile  submarines  (SSBNs).  Successive  evolutions  will  then  meet  the  capability  requirements  of  future  third-generation  nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines  (3G SSBN), while respecting the deadlines  and budgets allocated.  1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  52  This is the strategic direction that Naval Group  has resolutely adopted with the convergence  of its systems and the organisation of its offer  in product lines, which are partially common  to both surface ships and submarines. The  Sycobs  3.0  governance  and  architecture  contract, which defines the convergence  stages of the submarine combat systems, is  an important recognition of the group’s indus- trial prowess and capacity for innovation. As  a result, the French State has entrusted the  group with the role of architect-integrator,  in charge of bringing all the stakeholders  together around a roadmap and shared archi- tecture standards.  Evolving combat systems  The Sycobs 3.0 combat system for subma- rines and the Setis 3.0 combat management  system for surface ships are developed on  the basis of a stable architecture standard,  which itself is based on a sufficiently broad  functional scope in order to anticipate future  capability evolutions and modularity con- straints. Each Sycobs 3.0 architecture stan- dard takes into account the different con- figurations  on  board  the  submarines  and  anticipates the different capability evolutions  that will be rolled out during the successive  unavailability periods of the vessels.

This new equipment also withstands higher operating  temperatures in the data centres  which will, in turn, enable us to  implement air conditioning solutions  that consume less energy.”  The optimisation and streamlining  of the data centres will reduce  the group’s carbon footprint while  meeting our needs in terms of digital services and digitalisation.  Over a three-year period,  Naval Group has been accelerating  the modernisation of the data  centres on its sites while  simplifying the data storage  system and server architecture.  Although a signiﬁcant investment  is required for this approach, the  potential savings are also substantial,  as it should result in improved  technical performance and a reduced  environmental footprint.  “The oldest and most power-hungry  equipment is being decommissioned in favour of less energy-consuming,  more efﬁcient devices in which we are concentrating our computing power requirements”, explains Mathieu Léger-Chiron. “Thanks  to virtualisation, a single machine  can now house several servers.

The  first  building  blocks of the roadmap have been laid: - in January 2021, the launch of the devel- opment  contract  for  the  first  version  of  Sycobs 3.0, with the first roll-out targets  being  the  2G  SSBN  Le  Vigilant  and  Barracuda #4; - in February 2021, the first part of the devel- opment contract for the 3G SSBNs based  on Sycobs 3.0; - in the summer of 2021, the notification of  2G SSBN Le Terrible’s predispositions during  its current full cycle docking (FCD), to enable  it to receive Sycobs 3.0 and its new equip- ment during a future intermediate mainte- nance period;  -  in  October  2021,  the  French  State’s  approval of the Sycobs 3.0 specification  reference system common to 2G SSBNs,  Barracudas and 3G SSBNs. This profound transformation, which com- bines  shared  engineering  and  the  global  governance of combat systems, offers many  benefits: cost factorisation, incremental and  continuous development of new capabilities  and, ultimately, a more homogeneous and  efficient global offer at a lower cost. It will  also allow the group to improve its attrac- tiveness for exports and to position itself as  an  architect-integrator  of  the  naval  force  combat system on the global market. The  stakes are high and Naval Group is already  on the move. ■          THE SHORE INTEGRATION   FACILITY (SIF)     IN SAINT-MANDRIER.  1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  54  SYSTEMS  TOULON  LA SEYNE-  SUR-MER  Toulon Harbour  SAINT-MANDRIER  SHORE INTEGRATION FACILITY (SIF)  SYSTEMS TESTED AND   VALIDATED IN REAL TIME  Systems integrator: an expertise that requires   a comprehensive approach to on-board systems  and careful attention to each of the components and their  interactions, from the pre-project and design studies   to the maintenance of the vessel, through both quayside and  at-sea tests and the various implementation phases.  reality.  The  Panoramic  Sensor  Integration  Facility (PSIF), located on the cliff, houses a  test mast identical to that of future FDIs, with  its SeaFire® fixed-panel digital radar. An oper- ations centre has been established to replicate  80% of those of the future frigates, and a  dedicated space houses the equipment for  fighting asymmetric threats. ■  NAVAL GROUP’S TEAMS ARE CARRYING   OUT TESTS TO VALIDATE THE   PERFORMANCE OF THE COMBAT SYSTEM   BEFORE ITS ON-BOARD ROLL-OUT.  I  It is in Saint-Mandrier, on the site of the  French Defence Procurement Agency (DGA)  and facing the open sea of the Var penin- sula, that Naval Group is carrying out tests  to validate the performance of the combat  system before its roll-out on board. The  location is ideal because of the represen- tative and simulation conditions it enjoys,  thanks to the intense activity of the vessels  that sail off the coast and the aircraft that  are routed through the region. This historic  systems integration site, which has seen  the  group’s  flagship  programs  –  from   Charles de Gaulle to the Horizon and mul- timission frigates (FREMM) – is now home  to the work on the frigates for defence and  intervention (FDI) program.  A constantly active platform The site hosts the Shore Integration Facility  (SIF), a perfect illustration of the group’s role  as a systems integrator. The SIF enables  the group to de-risk and optimise the inte- gration of several of its systems equipment  for all of its first-rate surface ships, whether  new or undergoing renovation. Its contribu- tion  is  fundamental  prior  to  operational  commissioning and throughout the integra- tion of the combat system right up to the  final on-board tests, as it allows the teams  to reduce and control qualification timelines  at sea and to ensure that the expected per- formance is achieved. On the SIF, activity  is constant and intense: in 2021, in addition  to  the  first  FDI  tests,  the  infrastructures  hosted (among others) the tests of the mul- timission  frigates  with  reinforced  air-  defence capability (FREMM DA). For the integration tests of the first fully digital  FDI frigate, the site has been equipped in a  way  that  is  particularly  representative  of       SYSTEMS  SYSTEMS  experience for the team and a new look at  our method of working”, explains Guillaume  Lerda, Functional Integrator who followed  all the stages from Lorient to the at-sea  trials in Alexandria. Also in 2021, a major handover took place  as part of the Indian P75 Scorpène® con- ventional submarine program. The combat  system software development platform in  Ollioules, which has been working on all the  hardware and software sub-assemblies of  the combat system (CS) and the Combat  Management System (CMS) since 2010, has  passed the baton to the Services depart- ment in Brest, which is now responsible for  the in-service operation of the CS platform,  with Naval Group India as the front office.  The Services team in Brest will provide back- end base support, including fault diagnosis  and assessment, equipment monitoring and  obsolescence treatment during the life cycle  of these conventional submarines. Behind the scenes, the teams of the two  departments share the same objectives of  excellence in the processing of guarantees  and the execution of services; driven by a  collective  approach,  they  develop  new  know-how based on their exchanges.  Advanced technologies in mine  countermeasures  Spearheading  innovation,  the  new  mine  countermeasure systems require advanced  skills for their design and implementation,  with the use of advanced telecommunica- tions technologies, artificial intelligence for  decision-making autonomy and on-board  computing on the vessels and drones that  make up the systems. Naval Group, which  is developing these integrated drone-based  solutions  for  the  Belgian-Dutch  rMCM  program in partnership with ECA Group, is  also  contributing  to  the  development  of  European defence capabilities. The group  is  leading  the  European  consortium  that  won the MIRICLE project, for the innovation  and standardisation of future mine counter- measures, selected in 2021 by the European  Commission under the European Defence  Industrial Development Programme (EDIDP). ■  1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  56  FOR EGYPT’S GOWIND®   CORVETTE PROGRAM,   THE PANORAMIC SENSORS   AND INTELLIGENCE MODULE   (PSIM) INTEGRATED MAST   IS BUILT IN LORIENT AND   THEN SENT TO THE  ALEXANDRIA YARD (EGYPT).

DETECTING  CYBER  ATTACKS:  THE MISSION OF THE CYMS   THE OPERATIONAL HEART  of the cyber strategy of armed   vessels, the Cyber Management System (CyMS) detects   possible attacks in real time by simultaneously analysing   and monitoring the digital exchanges of the vessel’s systems.   In the event of an anomaly, the CyMS proposes reaction   scenarios to the operators who, thanks to simple and intuitive   interfaces, have immediate access to the necessary data   to adapt the reaction to the situation and thus make the best   choice. The CyMS is scalable and updated throughout   the vessel’s life cycle, and is constantly improved in partnership   with the French Navy, in order to better meet the needs   and operational constraints of its users.  FREMM ALSACE WHEN CYBERTECHNOLOGY COMES  WHEN CYBERTECHNOLOGY COMES TO THE HEART OF THE YARD TO THE HEART OF THE YARD  With this vessel – equipped with exceptional capabilities –  Naval Group shows that it is possible to combine  the requirements of cyber security with the imperatives  of operational continuity and autonomy at sea.  F  From  its  design  and  during  the  different  phases of operation, the vessel includes a  “base” of cyber systems in its digital systems  that guarantee robust protection against  threats, while maintaining a normal level of  activity on board: detection of anomalies or  malicious code, implementation of measures  to prevent an attack, alerts and response  organisation. Cybersecurity was involved in  all  aspects  of  the  Alsace  project,  which  lasted  30  months  with  an  average  of  200 people on board daily. Unprecedented  technical and organisational measures were  rolled  out:  software  protection,  human   training, the installation of an on-board air- lock and an advanced Cyber SubSystem  (CySS). Good practices that will support  future FREMM and Barracuda projects.

Designed and manufactured at the Naval Group site   in Saint-Tropez, an expert in the ﬁeld of submarine weapons,   the F21 is meant to destroy or neutralise enemy   submarines or surface ships.  I  It all began in 2008 with the “Future Heavy Torpedo”  program, now called Artemis. What was the objective?  To equip the 13 French submarines at the time, i.e. four  nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBN),  six next-generation Barracuda-class nuclear attack sub- marines (SSN), and three Rubis-type SSNs. The aim of the program was to replace the F17, with  which the French submarine fleet was equipped, with  a next-generation torpedo, which is more agile, faster,  more intelligent and has increased operational perfor- mance. The F21 began to equip the French fleet oper- ationally in 2020. With its unparalleled range and speed, Naval Group’s  heavyweight torpedo is designed to operate in deep  water, but also in coastal areas that are very noisy and  heavy  with  maritime  traffic.

Based on the incre- mental model, a framework agreement was  concluded between Naval Group and the  French Defence Procurement Agency (DGA)  as part of the Artemis program. It covers  the entire torpedo activity throughout its  life cycle, supports production means and  provides concrete benefits. The French Navy will now have an F21 tor- pedo that remains at the cutting edge of  innovation, thanks in particular to continuous  feedback from operational employees. The  DGA will be better able to anticipate the  markets and budgets. And thanks to the  incremental approach, the Naval Group site  in Saint-Tropez maintains engineering skills  that are useful for other activities. Through  a long-term view of operational needs, the  incremental strategy allows key skills to be  maintained, industrial and financial risks to  be reduced and contracting phases to be  accelerated.  Supporting submarine forces Located in Toulon, the Underwater Weapons  business unit’s Lagoubran workshop pro- vides support for submarine weapons on  board nuclear attack submarines (SSNs)  and nuclear-powered ballistic missile sub- marines (SSBNs).  A team of 25 employees works on periodic  maintenance operations to ensure the avail- ability and reliability of heavyweight combat  torpedoes and submarine countermeasures.  By also preparing exercise torpedoes and  participating in the evaluation of qualification  and training firings for crews, the team con- tributes to maintaining and improving the  operational excellence of the French Navy.  Close contact with the crews allows the  Underwater Weapons Business Unit experts  to better understand the operational needs  in order to design future weapons. ■  computing power, the F21 has exceptional  real-time processing capabilities, and ben- efits from an advanced mission system and  increased autonomy. These technical fea- tures greatly expand the possibilities for  tactical use, with an unparalleled target  discrimination capability, even in very com- plex  environments.  These  are  decisive  advantages for navies around the world.  France, Brazil:   the F21 is transforming testing In 2020, after the successful test firing of  an  F21  heavy  torpedo,  the  SSN  Suffren  definitively became a nuclear attack sub- marine. This was the demonstration that any  test firing requires meticulous preparation   and perfect coordination. While France was  the first navy to commit to the Artemis pro- gram, the Brazilian Navy is its first export  client. The intelligence of the heavyweight  torpedo – coupled with its dynamic perfor- mance –, integrated tactics and a high level  of autonomy make it the forerunner of armed  underwater drones. It is not surprising that  the Brazilian Navy also chose the F21 to  equip its submarines. The Riachuelo became  the first Brazilian Scorpène® to be equipped  with it.  Strengthened collaboration benefiting  all parties The discussions initiated by Naval Group  in  2017  led  to  a  win-win  model  for  all   1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  64  R S P ECTI  V  E  E  P  “SAINT-TROPEZ: A BROADER VISION  OF RESPONSIBILITY.”   Fanny Fortuna, Health, Safety at Work and Environment (HS&E)   Manager at the Saint-Tropez site  employees, is part of our corporate responsibility. This is why we now  involve the companies present on site  in improving health, safety and the  environment”, emphasises Fanny Fortuna.  In 2021, after the success of the ﬁrst  round launched in 2020, Saint-Tropez  requested the participation of intellectual  service providers. As such, the site  has included ﬁve new subcontractors.  The steering committee thus created  deﬁnes the objectives and means. Among the actions proposed and implemented:  the training of a rescue/ﬁrst-aid worker  on each team, a display on “dishwashing  waste” to illustrate food waste, a daily  exercise warm-up and themed rounds  for the security workers. These actions  were deﬁned in 2021. The result? Zero accidents in 2021 and signiﬁcant  performance in limiting food waste.  Every day, the Saint-Tropez site  welcomes several dozen professionals  in addition to the 300 or so Naval Group  employees. In order to reduce the number of accidents involving these  subcontractors as much as possible,  in 2020 the site launched a process  to improve the safety of people and  the environment. The initiative is  based on a steering committee,  which deﬁnes the objectives and action  plans required to achieve them. The initial aim was to limit accidents  involving subcontractors at the Saint-Tropez site as much as possible.  These external employees belong to companies that provide services  in the areas of security, logistics or  maintenance. In 2020, the Saint-Tropez  Health, Safety at Work and Environment  (HS&E) team involved four subcontractors  in its discussions in order to improve  health and safety at work: Défense  Environnement Services (maintenance, facility management), Sogeres (catering), Fiducial (security) and IDEA (logistics).  “Protecting the employees of our  subcontractors, who are exposed  to the same risks as Naval Group   UNDERWATER WEAPONS HANDLING 2.0 HANDLING 2.0  Specialising in strategic equipment for combat systems and armed  vessel platforms, the Naval Group site at Angoulême-Ruelle also  has a strong spirit of innovation. The site houses both the Innov’Factory  and an Open Lab. It is thanks to this innovation-driven ecosystem that,  in less than three years, a completely new concept of modular  weapons handling for submarines emerged.   I  Innovation is often incremental, and some- times disruptive. The new modular weapons  handling concept on board submarines, in  an  environment  in  which  movement  is   constrained and every square centimetre is  precious, clearly falls into the latter category.  In addition to the storage and handling of  weapons, this new concept allows for the  easy loading and reloading of weapons into  the submarine launch tubes. Its design was carried out in three stages:  firstly, the creation of a demonstrator in less  than three months in the Open Lab; secondly,  the creation of a definition file and the man- ufacturing of a full-scale prototype to vali- date the reliability of the concept; thirdly,  the performance of qualification tests. This next-generation handling system devel- oped in Angoulême-Ruelle is revolutionary  in its principle alone: in the past, it was nec- essary to develop large structures specific  to the size of each vessel. Now, modular  bricks have been developed that can be   1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  65  adapted to the size of the ship, based on  the Lego® principle. There are multiple benefits to this, starting  with the increased space. In concrete terms,  whereas the hold was dedicated solely to  weapons, the submariner can now dedicate  it to other uses, such as installing bunks or  a mini-sports room. Weight, costs and instal- lation time have now been halved, as the  modular method is standard, easy to use  thanks to an optimal and flexible human-ma- chine interface, and perfectly adapted to  the multimission capabilities of submarines  and, in the future, surface ships. A prime  example of ground-breaking innovation, the  modular handling method will equip all future  Naval Group vessels.  Angoulême-Ruelle:   the spirit of innovation Inaugurated  in  September  2019,  the  Innov’Factory in Angoulême-Ruelle accel- erates innovation processes, whether they  are technical, technological, organisational  or  methodological.  The  approach  also  speeds up the development process, opti- mises costs and ultimately enables innova- tion  to  be  integrated  more  quickly  into  Naval Group solutions. Thanks to the dual  contribution of the Innov’Factory and the  Open  Lab,  this  new  concept  of  modular  submarine weapon handling was born on  the Angoulême-Ruelle site. ■          1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  66  UNDERWATER WEAPONS  BRAZIL  BRAZIL  THE F21 IS TRANSFORMING  TESTING  In 2008, Brazil entrusted Naval Group with a highly ambitious program,   the ﬁrst part of which was the construction of four conventional submarines  for the Brazilian Navy, a new shipyard and a naval base. In 2021, Naval Group  delivered the ﬁrst batch of F21 torpedoes to Brazil and successfully   completed the test ﬁring of the Riachuelo, the ﬁrst of the four submarines.  B  Brazil  is  the  first  export  customer  of  Naval Group to benefit from the exceptional  performance  of  the  F21.  The  intelligent  heavyweight torpedo designed at the Saint- Tropez site is equipped, among other things,  with an advanced self-guided mode and  deep or shallow and confined water capa- bilities. The test firing of the Riachuelo, the  first Brazilian Scorpène® submarine to be  delivered as part of the first phase of the  Prosub (Programa Submarino) program, took  place on 11 November 2021. The stakes were   high  for  both  the  Brazilian  Navy  and  Naval Group. For the Brazilian fleet in par- ticular, the F21 increases the capabilities of  the Scorpène® tenfold, as it makes it pos- sible to carry out complex and tactical mis- sions in perfect autonomy.  Meticulous preparation This stage required many months of prepa- ration,  with  the  on-board  teams  of  the  Underwater  Weapons  business  unit,  as  well  as  those  of  the  Mission  and  Combat  Systems  (MCS)  division,  in  the  front  line.  In a field as complex as naval defence, the  convergence and coordination of the most   advanced expertise are the keys to success.  A few months earlier, the F21 boarding test –  during which the torpedo was boarded and  loaded into a tube on the submarine for the  very first time – had also been successful.  The  11 November  test  firing  represents  a  new success for the Prosub program, which  itself  is  the  result  of  close  cooperation  between Naval Group, its subsidiary Itaguaí  Construções Navais (ICN) and the Brazilian  Navy (Marinha do Brasil).   Prosub, the Franco-Brazilian program   Prosub is an ambitious naval export program  with a strong transfer of technology com-  ponent. The Riachuelo, the first Brazilian  Scorpène®,  was  successfully  built  and  assembled in Itaguaí, Brazil. The remaining  Brazilian  Scorpène®  submarines  will  be  delivered before 2025. They will all carry  Naval Group’s next-generation F21 heavy- weight torpedo. The collaboration between  France and Brazil, which began in 2008, will  continue with the second part of Prosub,  i.e. Naval Group’s support of the design and  construction of a new class of submarines  in Brazil. ■  THE TEST FIRING     OF THE RIACHUELO,     THE FIRST BRAZILIAN   SCORPÈNE® SUBMARINE   TO BE DELIVERED     AS PART OF THE FIRST   PHASE OF THE PROSUB   (PROGRAMA SUBMARINO)   PROGRAM, TOOK PL ACE   ON 11 NOVEMBER 2021.      UNDERWATER WEAPONS  TECHNOLOGIES  THE NAVAL GROUP SITE IN SAINT-TROPEZ,   WHICH SPECIALISES IN THE DESIGN AND PRODUCTION   OF SUBMARINE WEAPONS, PARTICUL ARLY PRODUCES   THE F21 HEAVYWEIGHT TORPEDO, WHICH WILL EQUIP   THE FRENCH NAVY’S SUBMARINES.   At the end of 2021, the Naval Group site in Saint-Tropez  made a presentation to the elected ofﬁcials of the Sud region  on an ambitious program to transform its development processes, called  “Engineering of the Future”. In response, the elected ofﬁcials  voted in favour of awarding a grant to support the program. This public  funding reﬂects the willingness of regional elected ofﬁcials  to support a major industrial player with cutting-edge expertise  operating in a highly competitive environment.  ENGINEERING  OF THE FUTURE:  THE SUD REGION  SUPPORTS THE  SAINT-TROPEZ SITE   LAUNCHED IN 2019,  the aim of the “Engineering of the Future”   program is to meet the expectations of the French Navy and   Naval Group’s export clients in the field of underwater weapons   and underwater combat. It allows the Underwater Weapons   Business Unit to meet the best system engineering and   digital simulation standards that currently apply to leading   manufacturers (mainly missiles, aeronautics and space). In   concrete terms, the program aims to improve simulation means   by creating a digital twin of the weapons and to develop   sub-system qualification tools to ultimately reduce the number   of at-sea tests and shorten development time frames.   1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  69  1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  68  ANTI-TORPEDO WARFARE TIME FOR THE NEXT   TIME FOR THE NEXT   GENERATION GENERATION  As underwater threats evolve and multiply, so do  Naval Group’s responses. Innovative and powerful,  its new countermeasures provide innovative  responses to the broad spectrum of threats faced  by armed vessels. Spotlight on the Canto® range.  T  The concept selected by Naval Group for  countermeasures is based on the principle  of confusion-dilution. The reality of threats  calls for innovative responses. Confusion- dilution  consists  of  overloading  torpedo  analysis capabilities by creating multiple  fleeting  targets  that  trigger  multiple  responses from enemy systems. Confronted  with  these  false  targets,  the  threatened  vessel has enough time to move away and  get out of range of the threat. The Underwater Weapons business unit,  based  at  the  Saint-Tropez  and  Toulon- Lagoubran sites, is committed to developing  both new effectors and new use concepts.  This is the very nature of the Canto® product  line, which is structured in three parts: the   Contralto®  tactical  evasive  manoeuvre  assist, the Canto® countermeasure and the  launcher part. For Naval Group, there is no question of  limiting itself to the protection of subma- rines. From the very beginning, and using its  own funds, the company wanted to develop  countermeasures that could be used by all  vessels. In addition, the new countermea- sures line must adapt to various types of  launchers (and therefore standards) used  in anti-torpedo and anti-missile warfare.  Frigates, corvettes, as well as aircraft car- riers and projection ships will therefore also  be able to benefit from this line in the same  way as submarines, with a choice between  two  launchers:  pneumatic  (designed  by  Naval Group) or pyrotechnic. It is already a  huge success in France (Canto® will equip  all the French Navy’s frigates) as well as  in  Brazil,  Egypt,  Saudi  Arabia  and  some  Southeast Asian countries.  Canto®: the convergence of expertise Ten years of R&D have resulted in the ability  to provide fleets with the countermeasures  they  need  in  the  context  of  heightened  threats. Within Naval Group, many entities  possessing the most advanced expertise  in their respective fields have contributed  to the development of the Canto® line. The  countermeasures departments, the design  office and testing services of Naval Group  site in Saint-Tropez, the Angoulême-Ruelle  site  for  the  launch  tubes,  the  Programs  Department teams, the Combat Systems  department and the Services department  for physical and functional integration on  board, are behind the development of a  complete countermeasures offer including  the tactical evasive manoeuvre assist, the  countermeasure and the launcher. ■          2 0 2 1   Surveillance  operations, combat,  intelligence…  To anticipate developments in the  naval defence market, Naval Group  works closely with its partners,  experts from the French Defence  Procurement Agency (DGA) and  representatives of the French Navy to  provide naval drone system solutions  and multi-drone mission management  systems that meet their operational  needs as closely as possible.  In 2021, several innovations were  presented, tested and selected as part  of national and European programs  and projects: French Navy aerial drone  system (SDAM), the oceanic  underwater drone demonstrator, the  launch and recovery system (LARS)  included in the Belgian-Dutch rMCM  mine countermeasure program etc.  In September, I4®Drones, the mission  management and controlled  decision-making system integrated  into the combat system, was  successfully deployed at sea and in a  command centre on land as part of  the European collaborative project  COMPASS* 2020.  * Coordination of Maritime Assets for Persistent  and Systematic Surveillance.

What was the objective?  Identify,  implement,  test  and  derisk  the  technologies  necessary  for  the  integra- tion of a tactical rotary-wing drone system   capability. Complementary to on-board heli- copters, this drone is intended for French  Navy vessels with a flight deck. This next-generation helicopter drone rep- resents a real technological breakthrough.  It should make it possible to increase the  operational  effectiveness  of  naval  forces  by increasing their control of the tactical  situation.   Presenting an operational solution   to the client With Airbus Helicopters in charge of the  drones, Naval Group is the project manager  responsible for their physical and functional  integration with the carrier ship’s combat  system, along with Safran, Thales and the  SME Hélicoptères Guimbal: in four years,  the  complementary  nature  of  the  skills  brought together in the program has made  it possible to produce a demonstrator of the  complete system. After its first autonomous  flight  in  July  2021,  the  demonstrator  is   YEARS  OF WORK FOR A DIVERSIFIED OFFER    OF NEW DRONE CAPABILITIES.  Designed to carry two additional  payloads, with an autonomy of   ten hours and a range of 100 nautical  miles (185 kilometres), the SDAM   will be a real pathﬁnder for spotting,  identifying and classifying threats  and abnormal behaviour.      AUTONOMY OF SYSTEMS AND DRONES  AUTONOMY OF SYSTEMS AND DRONES  continuing its tests. A new objective has  been set for 2022 with an at-sea testing  campaign on a multimission frigate (FREMM).  This will validate the landing and take-off  capability of this drone, which weight sev- eral hundred kilos.  A second demonstrator close to   its final version The anticipated order for the second SDAM  demonstrator, signed on 15 April 2021, and  the future XTO contract, which should be  signed in 2022, will pave the way from 2024  onwards for a new campaign for the tech- nical and operational testing of the system.  Crews will be able to familiarise themselves  with this system by using it in real-life sit- uations and over time. Representative of  the future SDAM, with all the inherent tech- nological components, this prototype should  demonstrate that the system is perfectly  reliable, safe and mature. This is a prereq- uisite for the development and production  of  the  series  SDAM  drones  that  will  be  added to the fleet’s range of operational  capabilities. The SDAM missions consist of  providing support to naval, high-sea and  coastal  operations,  both  by  day  and  by  night: the detection, recognition, identifi- cation,  tracking,  designation  and  even  engagement of targets, damage assess- ment, collection of tactical intelligence and  communication relays.   1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  74  SDAMs offer a wide range of technologies:  autonomous navigation, automatic take-off  and landing, implementation of different  payloads, integration with the carrier ship’s  combat system, secure data link to address  cybersecurity  issues,  and  the  option  of  cooperative use along with other vessels  in a multi-platform environment. ■  R S P ECTI  V  E  E  P  “TAKING INTO  ACCOUNT THE NEEDS  OF SAILORS AS  EARLY AS POSSIBLE IS ESSENTIAL.”   Leslie Simonneau, Human Factors (HF) Specialist   at Naval Group  the management of payloads and the piloting of drones.  This upstream work allowed us  to offer them realistic models  built on the basis of use cases.  Their feedback was utilised  in the development of the  demonstrator. Taking into  account the needs of sailors  as early as possible is essential.  The sailors are closely involved  in this process. They showed  us their working environment  (drone, consoles, vessel facilities  etc.) and our discussions  highlighted some key points  for the project. Lastly, HF is  part of the company’s social  and environmental responsibility  strategy. Contributing to the  performance and security  of systems requires improving  the quality of life of sailors on board by offering them ergonomic  and visual improvements.”  Naval Group’s human factors  specialists have been involved  since the risk assessment  contract for the French Navy’s  naval aerial drones program,  supporting the project’s  partner teams, Airbus  Helicopters, and of course  sailors throughout the design  process. Leslie Simonneau,  HF Specialist, takes stock  of the situation.   “In any program, taking human  factors into account from the very beginning of the design  process allows us to optimise  the operation of the future  system by ﬁnding the best  compromise between technical  constraints and user needs.  With the innovations brought  about by the SDAM, this is even  more true. We worked with  sailors to specify their needs as  future users in a brand new  operational context: organising  work in relation to the resources  envisioned, sharing space and  information with the other  operations centre operators,  and the human-machine  interfaces that would facilitate  F O CU  S  P  A  R  TNE R S  H IP  EUROPEAN COOPERATION  AND R&D The Belgian-Dutch rMCM  mine countermeasures program  is led by BNR, a Naval Group  and ECA Group consortium.  It involves many employees  from the Naval Group sites in  Lorient, Ollioules, Nantes-Indret,  Angoulême-Ruelle and Paris.  At the end of November 2021,  Naval Group and its partners  launched the MCM Lab.  This collaborative research  centre aims to become  the European reference centre  for mine countermeasure  research and development.  1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  75  LAUNCH AND RECOVERY SYSTEM (LARS) PREPARING FOR FUTURE COMBAT PREPARING FOR FUTURE COMBAT LARS is an automatic launch and recovery concept developed by Naval Group to operate  drones safely in dangerous maritime environments.  B  Because drones are an essential component  of future collaborative combat, Naval Group’s  teams have been working for several years  on a global project to physically integrate  them in all maritime fields, as organic means  for the vessel, and to launch them to level  5 sea states. As part of these developments, Naval Group  offers its clients proven integration solutions  via its I4®Drones product line. Today, the  innovation  programs  underway  have  resulted in a new offer: the implementation  and recovery of Unmanned Surface Vehicle  (USV) drones by a surface ship.  The LARS solution tested and validated  for surface ships The latest tests carried out as part of the  Belgian-Dutch mine countermeasures pro- gram (rMCM) have validated the LARS solu- tion. Located on the port and starboard sides  of the ship, each LARS consists of a gantry  that tilts on the vessel’s beam and a large  floating cradle that can be used to launch  and recover drones of up to 15 metres and  20 tonnes. ■          AUTONOMY OF SYSTEMS AND DRONES  DESIGNED AND DEVELOPED     WITH ITS OWN FUNDS     SINCE 2016, THE OCEANIC     UNDERWATER DRONE   DEMONSTRATOR     IS A PL ATFORM TO     INTEGRATE UNDERWATER     NAVAL TECHNOLOGIES.

Among these developments, a  major technological and human challenge is  the acceptability and trustworthiness of con- trolled decision-making autonomy (CDA),  which will be at the heart of UAV capabilities.  Controlled decision-making autonomy is the  ability of the UAV to reconfigure its mission  and trajectory by itself, according to the evo- lution of the tactical situation. To achieve  this, Naval Group has developed technolog- ical building blocks with an on-board artificial  intelligence algorithmic core that will orches- trate  a  set  of  functions  to  automatically,  efficiently  and  reliably  ensure  that  the  planned mission is carried out while respect- ing the behavioural rules and limits set by  the operator.  Physical prototype Launched in November 2020, the ten-metre  long,  ten-tonne  prototype  already  con- ducted several test campaigns off the coast  of Toulon in 2021. An initial fully autonomous  intelligence mission is planned for the sum- mer of 2022.  Future missions for the oceanic  underwater drone With an autonomy of several weeks, this  oceanic underwater drone demonstrator  will be able to conduct missions covering  the collection of information under water or  on the surface near the coast: sonar data,  surface data with imagery, and video. These  missions can be expanded to other areas  as required. ■  U  Underwater threats are evolving, in both  number and in technical nature. In fact, this  is becoming a major challenge for navies  which, in the near future, will need inno- vative capabilities to maintain their oper- ational upper hand, particularly in the field   of  underwater  warfare.  It  is  in  this  spirit   that Naval Group has initiated a long-term  forward-looking approach by developing  an oceanic underwater drone demonstrator  over the last five years, using its own funds.  This Concept Development and Experimen- tation approach is fully in line with the objec- tives of the French Navy’s Mercator 2030  plan, which identifies the use of technol- ogy demonstrators to increase the agility of  development processes, acquisition times  and quick incremental upgrades.  Innovative simulation platform The DDO is developed and produced in part- nership with Naval Group’s innovative eco- system. This platform is used as part of the  French  Navy’s  and  the  French  Defence  Procurement Agency’s (DGA) programs. It  allows technologies and operational con- cepts to be evaluated in order to iteratively  specify the underwater warfare systems of   THE OCEANIC  UNDERWATER DRONE  DEMONSTRATOR  An asset to supplement and rapidly expand the operational  capabilities of the French Navy.      TECHNOLOGIES  Increased militarisation of maritime spaces, multiple modes of action,  the size and variety of threats, uncertainties about  their behaviour and their means of detection: the operational  environment in which submarines operate is increasingly complex.  In order to continue improving the assessment of these threats  and to provide naval force command with optimal decision  support solutions, at the 2021 Naval Innovation Days Naval Group  unveiled an innovative project to deﬁne the safest  route to successfully rally submarines.  MANOEUVRE  ASSIST  UNDER  MULTIPLE  THREATS     FOR RAPID DECISION MAKING BASED    ON OBJECTIVE CRITERIA.     Winner of the 2019 La Pérouse Prize – awarded by   Naval Group’s Scientific Council – the project is the   result of work carried out by Naval Group teams   in collaboration with the international academic world.   A collaboration that has made it possible to overcome   certain technical and scientific obstacles in the fields   of digital systems and naval acoustics.   The new capabilities offered by the A3M algorithm,   integrated into the Combat Management System (CMS),   make it possible to calculate an optimal route,   depending on the submarine’s movement conditions,   and to propose manoeuvres to the operator via a   human-machine interface, along with assessments   of the chances and risks.   1 2 0 2 K O O B R A E Y  P U O R G L A V A N  78  1 1 2 2 0 0 2 2 K K O O O O B B R R A A E E Y Y  P P U U O O R R G G L L A A V V A A N N  79 79              SERVICES  Y R A U N A J 8 0  The nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine  (SSBN) Le Terrible returns to the Brest naval  base to continue its full cycle docking (FCD).

É hoje um grupo de altas tecnologias, líder   da área naval na Europa e totalmente empenhado no seu desenvolvimento no plano internacional.   No  âmbito  da  condução  das  suas  atividades,  o  Naval  Group  promove  uma  cultura  de  integridade  baseada  na   observância e na adequação às novas normas e legislações éticas aplicáveis, tanto em França como em todos os   países  em  que  os  seus  colaboradores  operam,  bem  como  no  princípio  de  tolerância  zero  para  a  corrupção  sob   todas as suas formas.   É neste espírito que o nosso novo Código de Conduta Compliance foi elaborado.   Este  Código  tem  por  ambição  enunciar  claramente  o  que  se  espera  de  todos  nós  e  das  nossas  partes   interessadas. Tem a finalidade de dar orientações concretas  e operatórias, a fim de que os assalariados possam   gerir  as  situações  de  risco  para  a  nossa  empresa,  tais  como  a  corrupção,  é  claro,  mas  também  o  tráfico  de   influência, o branqueamento e o financiamento do terrorismo, a fraude e os conflitos de interesses.   O nosso Código de Conduta Compliance, que faz parte integrante do Dispositivo de Compliance do Grupo, fornece   linhas  diretrizes  jurídicas  e  regulamentares  básicas  e  as  normas  de  comportamento  ético  essenciais  que  nos   ajudarão a tomar as decisões acertadas no âmbito dos negócios.

O Código de Conduta Compliance é o documento de referência do nosso Grupo,  relativamente a todas as questões que se enquadrem na ética dos negócios.   O  que  se  entende  por Compliance?

Tem  por  finalidade  permitir  que  cada  um  possa  enfrentar  situações  suscetíveis  de levantar questionamento em matéria de ética dos negócios.  Transmitimos  o  Código  às  nossas  partes  interessadas.  Dialogamos  com  elas  sobre os seus princípios, a fim de que possam compreender as nossas regras de  conduta e que aceitem se conformar a elas.   Lembra  a  possibilidade  de  assinalar  e  de  tratar  de  maneira  sigilosa  qualquer  potencial  violação,  através  de  um  dispositivo  de  alerta  específico  e  protegido  e  salienta a obrigação de cooperar plenamente com quaisquer inquéritos, internos  ou externos, que possam daí advir.   Este Código também faz referência a outros recursos, processos e documentos  que  permitam  descrever  de  maneira  mais  pormenorizada  a  conduta  a  ser  mantida em matéria de ética dos negócios.   As  regras  constantes  deste  Código  não  se  substituem  às  legislações  locais  ou  internacionais  aplicáveis,  às  quais  o  Grupo  se  compromete  a  se  conformar.  Devem ser conhecidas e aplicadas por todos.   Este  Código  não  pode  abordar  cada  uma  das  situações  potencialmente  problemáticas.  Em  caso  de  dúvida,  é  da  responsabilidade  de  cada  um  de  nós  pedir conselho.

O  que  se  entende  por corrupção?  Entende-se por  “corrupção” o fato de  prometer, propor ou  oferecer, solicitar ou  receber, direta ou  indiretamente, qualquer  vantagem indevida,  monetária ou de outra  natureza, a um terceiro  ou por parte de um  terceiro, com vista à  obtenção ou à  conservação de um  mercado ou de qualquer  outra vantagem  indevida, na condução  de uma transação  empresarial.   feitos   O  que  se  entende  por  pagamento  de  facilitação?  São  pagamentos  não  baixo  de  oficiais  montante  a  agentes  públicos  que  ocupem  postos  de  nível  modesto,  o  objetivo  de  obter  ou  de  acelerar  a  execução  de  formalidades  administrativas  rotina.    com   de     Respeitamos  as  legislações  e  regulamentações  aplicáveis  às  nossas   atividades.     Observamos o mais alto nível de exigência em matéria de integridade e  de ética dos negócios baseada em valores de integridade, honestidade e  transparência na condução das nossas atividades no mundo inteiro.     Aplicamos  a  tolerância  zero  relativamente  a  quaisquer  formas  de  corrupção,  passiva  ou  ativa,  de  qualquer  natureza  que  sejam,  que  se  trate  de  pagamentos  ilícitos,  presentes,  gratificações,  favores,  donativos  ilícitas  pagas  direta  ou  transferências  ou  de  quaisquer  outras  indiretamente a um cliente, representante ou a terceiros, ou recebidos de  terceiros.     Proibimos os pagamentos de facilitação.    A  Direção  Ética,  Compliance  e  Governança  estabelece  e  atualiza  as  regras  e  os  procedimentos  aplicáveis  em  matéria  de  Compliance  com  base numa cartografia dos riscos que determina.     Somos  particularmente  vigilantes  em  relação  às  empresas  controladas  direta  ou  indiretamente  pelo  Grupo  em  todos  os  países  em  que  se  encontram implantadas.        Mantemo-nos  informados  acerca  das  regras  e  dos  procedimentos  internos  em  vigor  em  matéria  de  luta  contra  a  corrupção,  o  tráfico  de  influência, o branqueamento de dinheiro e o financiamento do terrorismo.    As  refeições  de  negócios,  os  convites  e  os  presentes  modestos  de  caráter  não  pecuniário  podem  ser  oferecidos  ou  aceitos  no  âmbito  de  práticas comerciais normais. Em hipótese alguma podem influir ou dar a  impressão de influir numa decisão comercial ou estratégica.  Incentivamos  um  diálogo  aberto,  baseado  na  confiança,  com  os  nossos  colaboradores, em todos os níveis da Empresa. Os nossos colaboradores  são fortemente incentivados a comunicar entre si abertamente, a discutir  e a expressar quaisquer questões ou preocupações e a sua hierarquia é  incentivada  a  escutá-los  e  a  dar  mostras  de  reatividade  nas  suas  respostas.  Reforçamos,  assim,  nossa  cultura  em  comum  em  matéria  de  observação  das  regras  de  Ética  dos  Negócios  e  incentivamos  cada  um  dos  nossos  colaboradores  a  se  tornarem  plenamente  executores  das  nossas boas práticas.     Não toleramos represálias ou tentativas de represália diretas ou indiretas   contra um colaborador desinteressado que se exprime de boa-fé.     Em caso de dúvida sobre a aplicação do Código ou dos documentos que  a  eles  estão  vinculados,  queira  entrar  em  contato  com  o  seu  superior  hierárquico  ou  com  um  representante  da  Direção  Ética,  Compliance  e  Governança (ver “Contato”).   Direção Ética, Compliance & Governança do Grupo | Outubro 2017|    4                         Quais são as nossas práticas?   Entrada e acompanhamento das relações de negócios   Controles  adaptados  segundo  o  nível  de  risco  potencial  de  Compliance  são  efetuados com base nas informações coletadas ou fornecidas pelo terceiro antes  de  qualquer  entrada  em  relação  de  negócios  e  posteriormente  no  acompanhamento  da  relação,  a  fim  de  verificar  se  este  terceiro  atende  às  exigências  técnicas,  humanas,  financeiras,  regulamentares  e  éticas  feitas  pela  Naval Group e pelas suas partes interessadas.   Os  nossos fornecedores,  subcontratantes  e  prestadores  de  serviços (sobretudo  consultores,  agentes  e  fornecedores  de  offsets)  são  objeto  de  vigilância  específica  antes  de  entrarem  em  relações  de  negócios  e  posteriormente  no  âmbito do acompanhamento das nossas relações com estes últimos.  Além disso, a Naval Group se assegura de que os lobistas que agem em função  dos  interesses  da  Naval  Group  se  conformam  à  regulamentação  aplicável  às  atividades de grupos de pressão em todos os países em que são exercidas e, se  for o caso, às obrigações de transparência e declaração.   Presentes e manifestações de hospitalidade   Os presentes ou demonstrações de hospitalidade (inclusive refeições e viagens  de  negócios)  recebidos  ou  oferecidos  não  devem  em  hipótese  alguma  ser  destinados  a  influir  ou  a  serem  percebidos  como  podendo  ter  influência  numa  decisão  de  negócios  para  que  seja  tomada  segundo  os  interesses  da  Naval  Group ou de terceiros.   Em  numerosos  países,  os  presentes  e  demonstrações  de  hospitalidade  podem  desempenhar  um  papel  importante  no  estabelecimento  e  na  manutenção  de  boas relações de negócios ou, pelo contrário, ser vedados.  Os  nossos  colaboradores  têm  a  obrigação,  por  conseguinte,  de  adotar  em  quaisquer circunstâncias um comportamento prudente, recorrendo ao bom senso  e  fazendo  um  julgamento  esclarecido  quando  forem  levados  a  oferecer  ou  a  receber  presentes  e  manifestações  de  hospitalidade,  os  quais  devem,  de  qualquer  maneira,  ser  limitados  a  montantes  razoáveis.  A  Direção  Ética,  Compliance e Governança está à disposição para ajudá-los neste sentido.   No  interesse  da  transparência  e  para  facilitar  as  eventuais  auditorias  ou  verificações,  quaisquer  donativos  ou  entregas  de  presentes  ou  convites  devem  ser  registrados  com  exatidão.  Conforme  o  respectivo  montante,  deverão  ser  realizadas validações internas prévias.   Direção Ética, Compliance & Governança do Grupo | Outubro 2017|    5                           Participação na vida associativa   A  Naval  Group  respeita  o  empenho  dos  seus  colaboradores  nas  atividades  associativas  a  título  privado.  Essas  atividades  devem,  porém,  ser  estritamente  pessoais, sem comprometer a Naval Group de qualquer maneira que seja.   De  qualquer  maneira,  a  adesão  a  uma  associação  profissional  em  nome  da  Naval  Group  só  é  autorizada  se  não  infringir  a  estrita  neutralidade  religiosa,  política e filosófica que a Naval Group observa.   A adesão não deve constituir uma forma de corrupção ou de tráfico de influência  ou ser suscetível de ser percebida como tal por um terceiro de boa-fé.   Participação na vida política   A  Naval  Group  respeita  o  compromisso  individual  dos  seus  colaboradores  em  participarem, a título privado ou como cidadãos, em atividades políticas. Todavia,  é  estritamente  proibido  aos  colaboradores  fazerem  contribuições  políticas  em  nome  da  Naval  Group,  a  candidatos  a  eleições,  em  níveis  local,  regional,  nacional  ou  internacional,  a  partidos  políticos,  a  representantes  políticos  em  níveis  local,  regional,  nacional  ou  internacional,  a  qualquer  organização  ou  a  qualquer entidade política em níveis local, regional, nacional ou internacional.   Os  colaboradores  devem,  por  conseguinte,  assegurar-se  de  que  a  sua  participação  na  vida  política  se  inscreve  num  âmbito  estritamente  pessoal.  Assim, a participação na vida política só pode ocorrer durante o tempo livre, fora  das horas de trabalho e às expensas do próprio interessado.   Atividades de beneficência, filantropia, mecenato e  patrocínio   As  atividades  de  beneficência,  filantropia,  mecenato  e  patrocínio  realizadas  em  nome da Naval Group só são autorizadas se não forem proibidas pela legislação  aplicável  do  país  no  qual  são  realizadas  e  se  não  infringirem  a  estrita  neutralidade  religiosa,  política  e  filosófica  que  a  Naval  Group  observa.  Essas  atividades devem ser unicamente desenvolvidas em proveito de associações ou  de  organizações  sem  finalidade  lucrativa  ou  exclusivamente  para  fins  de  beneficência ou de projeção cultural para a Naval Group.   Direção Ética, Compliance & Governança do Grupo | Outubro 2017|    6                                 O que é um conflito  de interesses?    quando   Um  conflito  de  interesses  ocorre  os  interesses  da  empresa  e  interessem  pessoais  se  cruzam.  Um  conflito  de  é  interesses  necessariamente  um  problema em si, mas pode  tornar-se  um  problema,  se  rapidamente  não  identificado e corretamente  gerido   não   for   Conflitos de interesses   Os  colaboradores  agem  em  função  dos  melhores  interesses  do  Naval  Group  e  só  utilizam  os  recursos  e  os  bens  do  Grupo  em  proveito  exclusivo  do  mesmo.  Comprometem-se  a  transmitir  rapidamente  qualquer  vínculo  de  interesse,  pessoal  ou  familiar,  que  possa  ser  objetivamente  percebido  como  influindo  no  seu julgamento ou que possa criar uma forma de irregularidade.  Devemos  sempre  dar  a  prioridade  aos  interesses  da  Naval  Group  e  não  aos  nossos interesses pessoais.   Os colaboradores devem assegurar-se, no âmbito de uma atividade fora da área  profissional e fora dos horários de trabalho, de que não sejam utilizados para fins  pessoais  os  recursos  da  Naval  Group,  a  sua  propriedade  intelectual  ou  informações confidenciais.   Sinceridade  das  informações  de  contabilidade  e  finanças   Comprometemo-nos  em  nos  conformar  às  leis  e  regulamentos  aplicáveis  que  regem  a  nossa  contabilidade  financeira  e  a  nossa  prestação  de  contas  aos  nossos acionistas.   Para tanto, nós         classificamos e registramos as nossas transações e os nossos ativos de  maneira apropriada;  realizamos  controles  apropriados  para  apresentar  os  nossos  dados  financeiros de maneira precisa e coerente, principalmente os balanços e  resultados  das  nossas  operações,  com  vista  a  assegurar  uma  pista  de  verificação completa;     protegemos os nossos ativos adequadamente;    declaramos as nossas transações de maneira objetiva e em tempo hábil;    apresentamos informações comerciais com honestidade e transparência;  conservamos  os  documentos  e  as  financeiras  em    conformidade com as disposições legais e os procedimentos internos de  conservação de documentos;  cooperamos  plenamente  com  qualquer  missão  de  auditoria  externa  ou  interna  e  fornecemos  respostas  completas  às  perguntas  e  aos  pedidos  em tempo hábil.   informações      Formação   Estamos  empenhados  num  plano  de  formação  dos  colaboradores  e  dos  executivos  dirigentes.

O  nosso  Código  é  partilhado  e  discutido  com  as  nossas  partes  interessadas,  para que possam compreender e adotar os seus princípios.  Em  particular,  os  nossos  fornecedores  e  subcontratantes  comprometem-se  a  observar o nosso Código de Conduta Fornecedores.   Quais  são  as  consequências  em  caso  de  inobservância deste Código?   Em  caso  de  inobservância,  por  um  colaborador,  das  regras  estabelecidas  por  este  Código  ou  pelos  procedimentos  que  a  ele  estão  vinculados,  a  sua  responsabilidade  pessoal  poderá  ser  comprometida  e  poderá  expor-se  a  sanções disciplinares que serão proporcionais à gravidade da infração ao Código  e  descritas  no  regimento  interno  do  estabelecimento  na  França  ou  previsto  por  lei nas empresas não francesas do Grupo.   Assim, é da responsabilidade operacional, administrativa e ética de cada um que  leiam atentamente, assimilem e observem as disposições do presente Código.   Como  transmitir  as  supostas  transgressões  ou  infrações a este Código?   Incentivamos  uma  cultura  de  comunicação  aberta  em  cujo  âmbito  os  colaboradores  não  hesitem  em  manifestar  as  suas  preocupações  e  em  pedir  conselhos  e  no  qual  os  superiores  hierárquicos  estejam  à  escuta  e  deem  mostras de reatividade na resposta dada. Se um superior hierárquico não puder  responder a uma pergunta ou a uma preocupação, os colaboradores podem se  dirigir  a  um  outro  membro  da  rede  Ética,  Compliance  e  Governança,  tanto  no  âmbito da sua unidade, da sua direção, como da sua filial ou ao nível do Grupo.

This repository is applicable to any employee of  Naval  Group  SA  or  any  of  its  controlled  companies,  regardless  of  their  hierarchical level, or any person (sub-contractor, consultant etc.) working at any  of Naval Group's sites in France or abroad. It includes in particular:    -  The  Compliance  code  of  conduct,  which  is  annexed  to  the  internal  regulations of each  Group entity in France. The purpose of this  Code is to  set  out  what  is  expected  of  all  employees  in  order  to  combat  corruption  and influence peddling and, more generally, any form of fraud or unethical  behaviour.   - The Suppliers code of conduct sets out the commitments expected for all  suppliers  and  sub-contractors  regarding,  ethics,  CSR  and  anticorruption  matters.     The  repository  is  applied  operationally  in  the  company's  activities  through  procedures aimed at:   1.  Carrying  out  compliance  due  diligence  in  the  framework  of  contracts  and   agreements concluded between Naval Group and third parties;   2.  Ensuring  that  gifts,  meals  and  other  hospitalities  given  and  received  by  from  or  to  external  stakeholders  are   Naval  Group’s  employees  transparent and abide by the rules defined by the Group;    3.  Defining  a  whistleblowing  hotline  aimed  at  collecting  and  processing  reports relating to behaviours contrary to the ethics and CSR repository;    4.  Defining internal measures and controls regarding the prevention of risks   of conflict of interests;   5.  Defining  the  conditions  of  application  of  a  compliance  program   in   companies in which Naval Group holds participations.   For  foreign  controlled  companies,  these  procedures  are  adapted  to  the  local  context  and  to  the  specific  risks  they  face.  Controls  intended  to  verify  the  correct  application  of  those  procedures  are  operated  by  the  three  lines  of  control  of  the  Group.  Their  results  are  archived  by  the  functions  concerned  in  order to provide feedback intended for updating the group's risk mapping.   © Property of Naval Group SA 2019 – All rights reserved   Head office: 40-42, rue du Docteur Finlay - 75015 Paris  Tel: +33 (0)1 40 59 50 00 – www.naval-group.com  Naval Group - Limited company with a capital of 563,000,000 euros  RCS Paris 441 133 808 - SIRET 441 133 808 00135 - APE 3011 Z   Compliance program-Key procedures | February 2020 |    2                   NON-SENSITIVE   1.

Naval  Group  has  experienced  management  teams,  specialised  in  managing  relations  with  these stakeholders.   Compliance  due  diligence  for  these  projects  includes  specific  investigations  (identification  of  natural  persons  ultimate  owners,  managers,  judicial  background  etc.)  in  order  to  identify  and  treat  potential  red  flags.;  If  the  risks  identified  cannot  be  mitigated  properly,  Naval  Group  may  decide  to  stop  the  contractualisation  process  or  the  existing  business  relation  with  the third party. The Group also adds business ethics clauses in its contracts  mentioning  a  right  of  audit  and  a  termination  clause  in  order  to  ensure  compliance  with  anti-corruption  regulations  and  the  application  of  the  best  CSR standards.   Compliance due diligence is embedded in the Group procedures and decision  process, notably:   -  Assessing  and  managing  the  risk  of  corruption  and  influence  peddling  in  the  frame  of  agreements  or  contracts  concluded  between  Naval  Group  and third parties: Naval Group defines different levels of compliance due  diligence and a specific methodology in order to assess the exposure of a  business  project  to  the  risk  of  corruption  and  if  necessary,  to  prevent  them with a mitigation plan.     -  Managing  partnership,  merger  &  acquisition  and  joint  venture  projects:  Enhanced  compliance  due  diligences  are  performed  for  all  operations  relating  to  this  area.

Defining  internal  measures  and  controls  regarding  the  prevention of risks of conflict of interests.    Naval  Group  prevent  and  addresses  the  risks  of  conflicts  of  interest  (real  or  potential)  and  includes  those  that  may  result  from  relations  with  public  authorities, including Politically Exposed Persons. Among the planned measures:    - The integration of the risk of conflict of interest in the group's corruption  risk mapping. This mapping notably establishes a list of positions identified  as most at risk, updated at least every year.   - The integration into the hiring process of a position identified as at risk of  a due diligence procedure on the candidate verifying the compatibility of his  situation with the responsibilities and the position envisaged.  In the frame  of  this  procedure,  the  candidate  signs  of  a  sworn  statement,  confirming  the absence of any form of real or potential conflict of interest related to  his  new  position,  or  to  commitments  that  he  has  subscribed  to.  He  also  undertakes to inform his manager without delay in the event that he finds  himself  in  a  conflict  of  interest  situation.  These  declarations  are  archived  by the human resources department and can be consulted as necessary by  authorized persons.   If a problematic conflict of interests was identified in the framework of this  due diligence, the hiring process with the candidate may come to an end.   Specific measures are planned for the Naval Group Board of Directors, which has  its own internal regulations dealing, among other things, with  questions relating  to  the  identification  and  treatment  of  the  risks  of  conflicts  of  interest  of  its  members.   5.  Defining  the  conditions  of  application  of  a  compliance  program  in  which  Naval  Group  holds  participations.   in  companies   Naval  Group  defines  the  procedures  for  implementing  a  compliance  program  in  any  company  in  France  and  abroad  in  which  it  holds  participations.  In  this  regards,  procedures  regarding  the  compliance  program  can  be  adapted  to  the  specific local context of the country where it operates.    © Property of Naval Group SA 2019 – All rights reserved   Head office: 40-42, rue du Docteur Finlay - 75015 Paris  Tel: +33 (0)1 40 59 50 00 – www.naval-group.com  Naval Group - Limited company with a capital of 563,000,000 euros  RCS Paris 441 133 808 - SIRET 441 133 808 00135 - APE 3011 Z   Compliance program-Key procedures | February 2020 |    6",https://www.naval-group.com/en/compliance-programme-key-procedures,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Naval_Group_Logo.png,Naval-group
