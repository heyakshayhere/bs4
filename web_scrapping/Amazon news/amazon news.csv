1,"April 21, 2022",SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state,"


Amazon has been working closely with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to rapidly expand access to online grocery shopping to Americans who rely on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits across the country.

As families across the country were encouraged to stay home, Amazon worked closely with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to rapidly expand access to online grocery shopping to Americans who rely on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. What launched in 2019 as a pilot for expansion into only 10 states has quickly fast-tracked to a nearly national program in order to meet the evolving needs of customers, both during and after the COVID-19 crisis. Amazon now reaches beneficiaries in 48 states plus the District of Columbia, providing more than 99% of SNAP households1 with the ability to use their SNAP benefits online. Amazon volunteered to participate as a retailer in the USDA’s SNAP Online Purchasing Pilot in 2016 because we believe in its goals and to ensure that all customers have the opportunity to order groceries online.SNAP recipients in Alabama, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming can now use their benefits to shop for groceries on Amazon and other participating retailers—and we are working to expand access to additional states.With online acceptance of SNAP, Amazon’s selection, competitive pricing, and home delivery can improve the grocery shopping experience for SNAP participants. Customers can shop for groceries across two Amazon services: Amazon Grocery (shelf-stable food and household items in varying sizes), and Amazon Fresh (fresh produce, meat, and more; available in select metropolitan regions)—all with free shipping available. Amazon has waived the Prime membership requirement for SNAP customers to access Amazon Fresh, further reducing barriers to online grocery shopping.For further insight into the impact of online SNAP purchasing, we spoke with three leading hunger relief organizations fighting to end food insecurity""SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, is our first line of defense against hunger by serving as a critical safety net for 1.6 million New Yorkers who struggle to make ends meet. By enabling SNAP EBT as a payment method online, low-income New Yorkers now have increased access to healthy food choices with the ability to purchase fresh produce and groceries for their families online."" – Food Bank for New York City (FBNYC)""The online SNAP purchasing pilot is one important piece of the puzzle for food access for low-income customers. It puts SNAP customers on an equal footing with other consumers and provides new options for them to get food into their hands. SNAP is one of our country’s most vital social safety nets and must continue to play a critical role in reducing hunger, malnutrition, and poverty. Online ordering is important in regular times but especially so when all Americans have been encouraged to practice social distancing and protect individual and public health. The pilot program helps vulnerable households gain greater access to healthy food while staying home."" – Food Research and Action Center (FRAC)""We are grateful the USDA has been so quick to approve states’ requests to make online SNAP purchases possible for their residents. Online SNAP is an incredibly powerful tool that makes it easier for SNAP recipients to purchase nutritious food, particularly for those who have challenges getting to a bricks-and-mortar store due to myriad barriers, including the unique challenges presented by the current COVID-19 public health crisis. We applaud USDA, the SNAP processors, and the many retailers who have responded to meet this demand in record time during unprecedented circumstances."" – Alliance to End HungerAmazon is proud to continue to expand online SNAP acceptance to beneficiaries in more states and we remain committed to making food accessible through online grocery shopping, offering all customers convenience, time savings, and low prices delivered straight to their door.

Amazon Delivery Service Partners share their stories about getting into the business.

Family-owned and -operated small businesses are an important part of the U.S. economy. According to recent data from the U.S. Small Business Administration, nearly one-third of small employer businesses in the U.S. are family owned. As part of Amazon’s Delivery Service Partner (DSP) program, Amazon works with family-owned logistics and delivery businesses around the world to deliver packages to customers.Launched in 2018, the Amazon DSP program connects aspiring entrepreneurs with resources and coaching to help them build and scale their own businesses with Amazon. Today, Amazon partners with more than 3,000 DSPs globally that employ thousands of drivers and deliver for Amazon customers every day.Aimkhan Logistics and Total Package Logistics are two successful family-owned and women-led DSPs who have grown their businesses with Amazon. These DSP owners share their stories of how they got into business with their spouses, running their companies like family, and what their kids think of their parents’ entrepreneurial journeys.Maha Al-Absi and Aqeel Ahmed, owners of Aimkhan Logistics, Worcester, Massachusetts







Maha Al-Absi and Aqeel Ahmed spent most of their 20-plus-year careers in the corporate world working as certified project managers at large aerospace and insurance companies. Highly accomplished in their fields, they enjoyed their work. But they frequently discussed their own entrepreneurial ideas at the dinner table and how they could go into business together as a team one day.“I had always talked about starting a logistics business, since 2011 in fact,” said Ahmed. “The world is moving more and more online, and it was always something I thought I could do, but I never took the initiative.”That’s where Al-Absi stepped in. “It was February 2020, and Aqeel and a friend were talking—again—about logistics businesses. I remember because it was my birthday,” Al-Absi said. “After all this talk and no action, I said ‘Fine, if you’re just going to talk about it, I’m going to do something about it!’”Al-Absi applied for Amazon’s DSP program and was accepted. “I told Aqeel he had to run the business with me.”Al-Absi and Ahmed launched their business in August 2020, during the height of the pandemic.










Amazon, Delivered: Meet four women leading in logistics

Inside Amazon delivery stations and out on the road, women are a driving force in the company’s middle and last mile logistics.

“We set up the home office in our living room right next to our children, who were doing remote learning. We say that they got their MBAs during that time.” Parents to three kids, the two joke that they now have upward of 60 kids, having expanded from five drivers when they started their business with Amazon to more than 65 drivers today.“Our drivers and employees are like our family. They know our kids; our kids know them. We support them and guide them like we would our own children,” Ahmed said. “We opened our business to help people. Not just to earn money, but to change people’s lives. We mentor our drivers and encourage them to move on to bigger things in their lives.”At the end of the day, they see their business as a stepping stone for their employees.“We can provide our employees access, guidance, and support so they can learn how to become managers themselves and move up in their careers,” Al-Absi said.For some, that means graduating college and paying off student loans. For others, it means becoming financially independent and moving into homes or apartments of their own.“At the end of the day, this is a family business, and we want our employees to achieve their goals and dreams, just like we desire for our children,” Al-Absi said.Alison and Greg Gatto, owners of Total Package Logistics, Boca Raton, Florida







Like Al-Absi, Alison Gatto acted on her husband’s curiosity and became an entrepreneur and DSP owner somewhat by accident.Gatto was living her dream of owning a successful luxury salon in Florida in 2018. She’d opened the salon 10 years earlier and had grown a staff and clientele that she was immensely proud of. A decade into living her dream, a chance conversation with her husband changed her life.“He had heard about this program with Amazon to open a small delivery business, and I just thought it sounded like something I’d be good at. Even though I didn’t know anything about logistics, I knew a lot about managing people,” she said. “I didn’t realize how much it would positively change the course of my life.”










Amazon, Delivered: From survivor to inspirational entrepreneur

A difficult past didn’t stop Amazon Delivery Service Partner Sophia Strother from realizing her potential, while inspiring others. Find out how Strother became a thriving business leader, entrepreneur, and community advocate.

Gatto applied and was accepted into the DSP program and soon found herself launching a new business endeavor in an industry that she knew little about. Together, she and her husband Greg learned as much as they could about logistics and found that running a delivery business was not too dissimilar from running the many other businesses–including a burger restaurant–they’d owned over the course of their marriage.“The great thing about working with your spouse or partner is that you know their quirks, their strengths, and if you know how to communicate with each other, you can work well together,” she said. “I leave the manual labor and repairs to him; he leaves the operations to me!”“Both my husband and I are very entrepreneurial,” she said. “He’s always been self-employed and encouraged me to live out my dream of starting and owning businesses as well.”Gatto’s three daughters think what their mom is doing is pretty neat.“My middle daughter is 15 years old, and she’s taken an interest in the business. She’ll come into my office when I’m doing paperwork or planning and want to know more about it. To see that budding interest in entrepreneurship is an incredible thing to witness, and for her to see her parents helping each other succeed in business is an example I’m proud of.”Amazon is investing in the future, constantly finding new ways to empower employees and partners to succeed.

3,"April 21, 2022","Building on progress at Amazon’s HQ2 in Arlington, Virginia","


With plans nearly complete for PenPlace, the next phase of Amazon’s HQ2, learn what the project will bring to the community.

Update: We’d like to thank our Arlington neighbors and the County Board for their partnership and feedback through the years-long process of designing PenPlace, a project we believe will benefit the entire region. With the County Board’s approval, we look forward to continuing our work with the community as we take the next steps on this journey to build an integrated, innovative, and sustainable second headquarters in Arlington, Virginia.We announced in late 2018 that Arlington, Virginia, would be home to Amazon’s second headquarters (HQ2) and that we would bring more than 25,000 jobs to the region. Since then, we’ve made some significant progress in our commitment to be a trusted business and community partner. We’ve continued to engage with local organizations and now work with over 100 nonprofits, civic groups, and small businesses, providing in-kind support and charitable donations.Our hard-working recruiting teams have crossed an important hiring milestone, with more than 5,000 employees now assigned to our second headquarters. Our construction partners have put in more than 2 million hours of work and recently celebrated finishing the top floor—the “topping out”—of Met Park, the first phase of HQ2. And finally, our architecture, design, sustainability, and transportation teams have engaged with the local community and partnered with Arlington County to continue improving the design of PenPlace, the next phase of our development.

Watch now
















As we prepare to take the next step in our more than $2.5 billion HQ2 investment, we want to provide a snapshot of what the project will bring to the Arlington community and the wider region. Here are some highlights:More sustainable, by designWhen we announced the development of HQ2, we challenged ourselves to think big and design Amazon’s buildings in a way that helps lead the industry toward net-zero carbon. In pursuit of this goal, we have electrified the operations of HQ2, eliminating the use of fossil fuels for buildings systems and our food service. We’ve committed to powering 100% of HQ2’s operations with renewable energy through a combination of off-site and on-site solar projects, aligning with The Climate Pledge, Amazon’s commitment to be net-zero carbon across its operations by 2040.






PenPlace will provide more than 100,000 square feet of retail space for dining, shopping, and a childcare facility. Multimodal pathways will connect throughout the site to prioritize access by foot and bike.Download the high-res image.

To do this, we’ve contracted 82 megawatts (MW) of energy from a new 120 MW solar farm in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, which is expected to generate 172,500 megawatt hours (MWh) of renewable energy annually once operational later this year. The renewable energy generated at this site will be used in part for the operation of HQ2 and other Amazon-owned buildings across Virginia, including Whole Foods Market stores and Amazon fulfillment centers. The remaining portion of energy generated by the solar farm has been contracted by Arlington County and will provide clean energy for use in the region. At PenPlace, we will also have rooftop solar panels installed, totaling 1 MW of clean energy capacity to further support our sustainability efforts.Our plans to focus on sustainability at PenPlace include:Committing to achieve LEED Platinum certification, the highest sustainability certification for a development issued by the U.S. Green Building Council.Integrating strategic climate-responsive design for our office buildings, including high-performance glazing and built-in solar shading that will reduce the need for building heating and cooling, targeting a savings of 30% over the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) baseline.Providing more than 125 electric vehicle charging stations, with the ability to double capacity as needed.Leveraging low-flow fixtures and reclaimed water usage to reduce water consumption by 50% beyond national standards.Reducing the amount of embodied carbon in the concrete structure compared to typical construction practices by at least 10%, along with a commitment to offset 100% of the remaining embodied carbon from building materials.Using bird-safe glass where appropriate on all seven buildings at PenPlace to ensure that the development is safer for the region’s bird population.Connecting the neighborhoodWe’ve designed PenPlace to be part of the local neighborhood because we want both employees and local residents to enjoy the space equally. This means considering how people will travel to get to PenPlace and how they will utilize the space each day. Our plans prioritize access by foot, bike, and public transportation, with a 15-foot-wide multimodal path that will be part of the Green Ribbon, a network of pedestrian and shared-use pathways throughout the neighborhood. When complete, PenPlace will provide more than 900 interior and exterior bike storage stalls, to encourage bike commuting over the use of single-occupancy vehicles. All vehicle movements on-site will occur underground, including loading docks, which allows for contiguous outdoor public space with gathering areas, public plazas, and ample green space for the community to enjoy.






An open-air amphitheater will provide space for programming and events, including concerts, farmers markets, and evening movie screenings.Download the high-res image.

Providing parks and public spaceAfter engaging with the local community, we heard feedback from our neighbors and shifted our designs to integrate more planting areas and maximize publicly accessible green space at PenPlace. The project will create 2.75 acres of public park space, available for community use, including immersive forest rooms, shaded seating groves, water features, and many native and pollinator gardens. We will plant more than 100 native plant species and over 500 new trees throughout the site—all inspired by the natural ecosystems of the surrounding region. An open-air amphitheater will provide space for programming and events, including concerts, farmers markets, and evening movie screenings. We will also build a dog run for Arlington’s four-legged residents.






In addition to the central green, PenPlace will include immersive forest rooms, shaded seating groves, water features, a dog run, and many native and pollinator gardens, all for the community to enjoy.Download the high-res image.

Adding vibrancy to the neighborhoodOne of the main opportunities of designing a welcoming, inviting, and well-connected development will be the ability to support vibrant, local small businesses. PenPlace will provide more than 100,000 square feet of space for dining, shopping, a childcare facility, and other opportunities across the main buildings and three retail pavilions. We’re also dedicating over 26,500 square feet to establish a new home for Arlington County Community High School. This public school will provide an opportunity for approximately 300 students to pursue their academic goals while preparing for the future.Building more than office spaceThe Helix, a spiral-shaped building in the northeast corner of PenPlace, will become a landmark for Arlington and the National Landing area. This distinctive building will take our biophilic-led design principles to new heights, integrating nature and working to inspire innovation and invention. The interior of the Helix will provide formal and casual meeting spaces in an environment filled with more than 25,000 square feet of planting areas and living walls. The exterior of the structure will feature two paths for employees to engage with colleagues in meetings or to take in views of Arlington, the Potomac River, and Washington, D.C. The Helix will also be home to an artist-in-residence program and a meeting center, and it will be open to the public and community to enjoy two days per month. We can’t wait for everyone to see this unique and thoughtfully designed space come to life.Engaging with the local communityWe know that success and scale bring broad responsibility, and we strive to be good neighbors in the communities in which we operate. When we chose National Landing as the site of HQ2, we made a commitment to be a trusted business and community partner in the region, and our work to become a part of the fabric of this community reflects that commitment daily.










First local retailers sign on to open shops at Amazon’s HQ2 

District Dogs and RĀKO Coffee are the first small businesses to sign leases at HQ2 as part of Amazon’s pledge to bring local, minority- and women-owned retailers to its second headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. 




Watch now
















Since we announced Arlington as the site of HQ2 in 2018, we have committed more than $35 million in total investments to local nonprofits, community groups, public schools, and businesses. This includes both monetary and in-kind donations—like school supplies to public schools across Northern Virginia and food donations to local food banks and pantries for families in need. We also know that housing affordability is front of mind for many in the community. Through the Housing Equity Fund, we’ve contributed more than $800 million to support affordable housing in the Arlington and metro-Washington, D.C., areas, with more to come. Since the launch of the Amazon Housing Equity Fund 15 months ago, our efforts are helping to create and preserve more than 4,400 affordable homes. Based on data provided by Arlington County, the Fund has helped to increase the affordable housing stock in Arlington by 22%.We will continue to engage with the Arlington community to understand how we can best support the issues that matter to local residents. Our goal is to build a second headquarters that integrates into the surrounding neighborhood and benefits the entire region. We appreciate Arlington County and the community’s partnership in this process, and we are excited to continue the conversation.

4,"April 21, 2022",AWS customers create sustainable solutions to impact climate change,"


Companies use AWS services in creative ways to build local and global innovations designed to address the climate.

In February, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaption and Vulnerability report, which warns that climate change “impacts are approaching irreversibility.” To create the report, hundreds of leading scientists contributed data and 195 countries agreed and signed on. The report states:Some losses are already irreversible, such as the first species extinctions driven by climate change … Other impacts are approaching irreversibility such as the impacts of hydrological changes resulting from the retreat of glaciers, or the changes in some mountain … and Arctic ecosystems driven by permafrost thaw. (page 10)The hopeful part about that excerpt are the words “approaching irreversibility.”It means, while the window is closing, we still have time to mitigate—and even turn around—major aspects and impacts of climate change. But we need to act now. That’s exactly what some Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers are doing—using AWS services to innovate in areas like tree equity, biodiversity, and waste reduction.Environmentally friendly ride-sharingIn 2016, Volkswagen Group (Volkswagen), an AWS customer, created its MOIA ride-sharing service to address the issues of fossil fuels and emissions head-on with its fully electric vehicle fleet. Unlike most other ride-sharing services, MOIA was fossil fuel free from inception. Volkswagen uses electric batteries to run MOIA’s custom-built, special-purpose vehicles.

MOIA Ridesharing







Today, MOIA ride-sharing is available in two German cities—Hamburg and Hanover. Riders use the MOIA app to order ride service, and they share their vehicle with up to five people traveling in the same direction. The app’s user interface (UI) includes pick-up and overall trip times, stops en route, walking duration needed to complete the journey, and vehicle number.Volkswagen designed MOIA as a stable, cost-efficient, sustainable alternative to traditional ride-share fleets. They built MOIA using AWS services, including Internet of Things (IoT) that powers the vans’ sensors and let MOIA collect data and continually improve performance. “AWS provides us with a variety of services we need so we can combine them together. We use a lot of IoT and AWS IoT Greengrass to have Lambda@Edge in the vehicle to collect all of the data,” says Moritz Siuts, director of engineering at MOIA.

MOIA's electric ride-share solution results in fewer cars on city streets and improves the quality of life in cities—local changes that contribute to global environmental impacts. It’s a model for the environmental slogan: “Think globally, act locally.”Los Angeles tree program addresses climate change and shade disparityOne of the greatest counterforces to climate change is nature. Trees, for instance, help abate climate change through air pollution reduction and carbon sequestration. The latter involves any biological, chemical, or physical processes that naturally capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.However, inequities exist in many U.S. cities when it comes to tree cover. Disadvantaged and low-income communities have 15.2% less tree cover and are 37.4 °F (2.7 °C) hotter than high-income areas. The Nature Conservancy helps Los Angeles address this disparity using data and AWS services to support ArcGIS StoryMaps, which helps the city garner support for increasing tree cover in underserved communities.

Los Angeles: Plant a Tree, Grow a Community | Climate Next by AWS







ArcGIS StoryMaps is a story-authoring, web-based application that allows users to share their maps in the context of narrative text and other multimedia content. The geographic information system (GIS) technology it’s based on is a spatial system that creates, manages, analyzes, and maps all types of data. Esri, which is an AWS Partner Network (APN) Partner, created the application.Werner Vogels, Amazon’s chief technology officer, created the Climate Next series to highlight AWS technologies that AWS customers and AWS-supported initiatives use to solve complex human problems. Climate Next featured The Nature Conservancy’s work to reduce tree disparity in Los Angeles.According to The Nature Conservancy, 83.6% of people live in urban areas. “If we want to make an impact on climate change in people's lives, we have to consider how our cities are going to cope with the climate crisis that we are in,” said Tanushree Biswas, carbon program director at The Nature Conservancy. ""Story maps are a great way for us to translate complicated science into action items.""Biodiversity and ecosystem modeling in Costa RicaAlthough Costa Rica accounts for only 0.03% of the Earth’s surface, it’s home to nearly 6% of the world’s biodiversity. The National Center of GeoEnvironmental Information (CENIGA) at Costa Rica’s Ministry of Environment and Energy (MINAE) is a technical intelligence unit that uses mapping and modeling tools to integrate, standardize, and communicate Costa Rica’s environmental data.







CENIGA convenes with governments and scientific institutions worldwide to develop methods that identify biodiversity patterns, helping leaders to make better decisions and policies for sustainable development in Costa Rica and around the world.The process begins with Earth observations (EO)—data about Earth’s physical, chemical, and biological systems. Examples of EO data include recording rainwater trends, monitoring temperature, and mapping forest cover. Satellite technology makes it possible to capture EO information by using remote sensing in near real time, providing a more comprehensive picture than with data collection on the ground.However, standalone EO cannot fully assess ecosystem properties like biodiversity and changes over time. The analysis also needs ecosystem service modeling, which uses geospatial data to predict patterns about a real ecosystem. Pairing robust EO datasets with modeling leads to more accurate and relevant predictions of how ecosystems behave and might evolve. The work starts with accessing the EO datasets available on AWS and then using the data to conduct the ecosystem service modeling with AWS Cloud technology.

CENIGA built its infrastructure on AWS with AWS Promotional Credits from the Earth Observation Cloud Credit Program, a collaboration between the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI)—a program that seeks to accelerate sustainability research and innovation by minimizing the cost and time required to acquire and analyze large sustainability datasets—and the Group on Earth Observations (GEO).Immersive 3D shopping experiences built on AWSA 2021 Corporate Social Responsibility Survey reports that 83% of consumers believe that businesses should actively shape their best practices around environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. Climate change is a key ESG issue, and retailers are actively looking for ways to reduce their carbon footprints and reach net-zero emissions targets in the next few years. However, with consumers increasingly shopping online, extra packaging, fulfillment, and transportation needs are increasing emissions.Creating and selling a product involves a long chain of transactions, with each one contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the production of visual assets that power the customer experience for retail and consumer packaged goods includes transporting models and photographers to shoots, and the shipping and disposal of items involved in production.What if products didn’t need to be shipped, dressed, photographed, and retouched? What if consumer conversion rates could increase by 70% and returns reduced by 40% by using 3D visualization?

To celebrate the launch of Margaret Atwood’s new short with Amazon Original Stories, the famed author and poet sat down to discuss the piece with her longtime friend—and tarot reader—poet and author Damian Rogers. 

How do beliefs inform actions? In Margaret Atwood’s new short story, “My Evil Mother” (free for Prime and Kindle Unlimited members in eBook and audiobook), a woman remembers when her mother issued a prophecy: If she didn’t break up with her high-school boyfriend immediately, the relationship would end in a disastrous fate. Her mother had consulted the tarot, and the Universe didn’t like them together. “I still believed that my mother had some influence over the Universe,” the daughter admits, from the distance of many years.Struggling for independence from an overbearing and controlling mother is never easy, but it’s especially challenging if you, like the narrator, believe that your mother is a witch with supernatural powers. Though this mother looks like the other mothers in their mid-1950s Toronto suburb—crisp shirtdress, flowered apron, single-strand pearls—she doesn’t act like the other mothers. For one thing, she runs the household on her own, with no father in sight. And then there’s her convincing insistence that she has privileged access to the shape of the future.







The story comes from Margaret Atwood, who in her more than five-decade writing career has herself been suspected of oracular talents. The prolific and award-winning author, whose novels include The Handmaid’s Tale, has been hailed as a seer for her uncanny habit of plausibly predicting which way the wind is going to blow.On the morning before this year’s spring equinox, we drank coffee and nibbled pastries in her large, sunny kitchen in Toronto, and discussed “My Evil Mother.” Like the daughter in the story, I was raised by a single mom who read tarot cards, and so I brought my deck to give Atwood a reading.




                “There are an infinite number of possible futures, and which one you get is going to depend on what you do now”
            

Margaret Atwood, award-winning writer and author of ""My Evil Mother""




Before I pulled any cards, however, she’d read my palms with great accuracy. (“Be careful with who you allow in the door.”) At one point she disappeared briefly and came back with taped-together mass-market copies of Joseph F. Goodavage’s Write Your Own Horoscope and Maria Elise Crummere’s Sun-Sign Revelations, both of which she’d used for hand-casting her friends’ horoscopes before the internet, calling the practice “vintage woo!” We spent a lot of time laughing as we talked about intuition, the enduring allure of esoteric systems, the power of ambiguity in stories and in prophecy, and the timeless need to read the signs.Below are highlights from our conversation, including insights into her new work and what the cards say about her future:“My Evil Mother” is, among other things, an intergenerational tale featuring mothers who find creative ways to protect their daughters. What’s your take on the idea of “mother’s intuition?""What is mother’s intuition, anyway? If you’ve grown through 500,000 years of evolution in which it’s important for you to pay attention to the moods of those around you, because your own well-being depends on it—the needs of those more powerful than you in the group, and the moods and reactions of those dependent on you, such as children—that’s not some kind of secret power, it’s heightened power of observation.










This Amazon employee reads great books on behalf of our customers

Welcome to our new series ""Real (cool) jobs at Amazon,"" where we highlight some of the most peculiar jobs at Amazon.

Do you think all women have this heightened power of observation?Well, what century are we living in? Is this supposed to be some sort of universal, das Ewig-Weibliche kind of 19th-century “eternal woman” thing?Wait, what was that you said after ""universal?""It’s German, it’s from Goethe —“the eternal feminine.” There was a period of myth-making about women in the 19th century in which they were credited with all kinds of arcane powers, special “women’s intuition.” Because they’re so good at taking care of people, that’s all they should do. They should stay in the home and take care of them. I used to collect this stuff, I have a book called The True Glory of Woman—and that would include dealing with the bedpans. Because we’re so good at it.So this thing we call intuition—some men appear to be quite intuitive, and other men appear not to be. So, let us say it is an individual thing. We happen to notice people who have this hyper-noticing ability in connection to children when we see it in action, but it certainly doesn’t mean every woman has it, and it doesn’t mean that every man is without it. Caregivers of any kind have to read the signs, and the signs are physical. It’s not something in the air. You’re noticing people’s behavior and their facial expressions.In the spirit of reading signs, what is it about astrological systems—tarot, palm reading, astrology—that interests you the most?I’m curious about these things in the way that I’m curious about just about everything.TikTok currently has over 30 billion views on the #astrology tag and roughly 20 billion views on the #tarot tag. What do you make of this surge in popularity?Because everybody is interested in themselves. What’s your next question? [She laughs.] We love being told things about ourselves that we don’t know.As long as they’re flattering.As long as they’re flattering.You’ve written about the fact that you learned to read tarot cards in the late 1960s, while studying T.S. Eliot’s poem, “The Waste Land.” Tarot was experiencing an uptick then, too. Do you see a pattern to these cycles of interest?The old ways of knowing about oneself are going out of fashion. [In the late 1960s] it was no longer so chic to have a Freudian analyst, or even a Jungian one. The more chaotic things appear out there, the more people are in search of some form of structure, a way of making sense. It’s certainly a period of chaos—old values being challenged, stuff falling apart, political systems that worked for a long time being called into question, and major power struggles going on all around us, of many different kinds.One possible read of why the mother in your story reaches for supernatural strategies is that they provide a way to exercise power and agency in an environment in which these might otherwise not be available to her as a single mother in the 1950s.I think that’s why a lot of people do this stuff. I think they are in search of protection and agency.In the story, the mother says, “They may not like me, but they respect me. Respect is better than like.” The daughter doesn’t agree at all. What are your thoughts?It’s nice if you can be likable, but sometimes you just can’t be. If everybody likes you, there’s something wrong. You don’t want a lot of schmucks liking you. Sam, my next-door neighbor, a gruff lawyer, came out one autumn as I was sweeping up my leaves, and he says, “Margaret, you shouldn’t let people see you do that,” and I said, “Sam, what are you talking about?” And he said, “It’s the broom. Don’t you know they call you the Wicked Witch of the Annex?” I said, “Sam, people respect fear. It’s better to be feared than liked.” And he said, “Margaret, you’re right.”

Oracles in the ancient world were always ambiguous. They didn’t say, this will inevitably happen. They were like warnings—if this, then that. People ask, “Are you prophetic?” and I say absolutely not. There isn’t one The Future. There are an infinite number of possible futures, and which one you get is going to depend on what you do now. But of course, the other bad thing about that is that you can’t infallibly predetermine the results of your own actions.The “evil” mother in your story relies on tarot (and even pulls three cards about her daughter’s “surly faced” boyfriend that she claims add up to a tragic fate). So in the spirit of the story, I’ll pull three cards for you.The first is Ten of Pentacles; the energy of this card is looking backward and forward at the same time. The second is Ace of Wands, with Aces being gifts and tools, and Wands being about life force and the will. You have a strong will! But we knew that. The last card is Six of Cups. Are you writing about the past?I have been. How did you know that?Six of Cups is usually about memory and childhood, and can also be the sweetness of early connections. When it’s negatively aspected, it can refer to being stuck in the past. But beside Ten of Pentacles and Ace of Wands, I would read it as speaking to your creative work.I’m about to start a memoir.That’s exciting. I don’t think you’ve written a memoir before, have you?Bits and pieces here and there, but no, not a whole book.It looks good, the cards are all very positive.We’ll see how it turns out.“My Evil Mother” by Margaret Atwood from Amazon Original Stories is available now. Like all Amazon Original Stories titles, the story is free to Prime members and Kindle Unlimited subscribers, and $1.99 for non-members. That includes the audio version, too.Damian Rogers is the author of the memoir An Alphabet for Joanna: A Portrait of My Mother in 26 Fragments (KnopfCanada). She is currently writing her way through the tarot deck on Substack at “If It’s Alive, Feed It.”

Amazon is investing $1 billion to spur supply chain, fulfillment, and logistics innovation and further improve the customer and employee experience.

Amazon is creating a $1 billion venture investment program called the Amazon Industrial Innovation Fund (AIIF) to spur and support innovation in customer fulfillment, logistics, and the supply chain. As customers increasingly shop online and look for even faster delivery, Amazon continues to invent new ways to raise the bar on customer and employee experience while working with other companies focused on those fields.Amazon has invested and innovated substantially over the last two decades in next-generation technology in its operations. This new fund is one of the ways Amazon continues to invest, along with many other initiatives, such as the MARS and re:MARS conferences that Amazon hosts every year. The conferences bring together innovative minds in machine learning, automation, robotics, and space to share new ideas across these rapidly advancing domains.“We see an opportunity to look beyond our own experience and empower companies that are developing emerging technologies in customer fulfillment operations, logistics, and the supply chain,” said Alex Ceballos Encarnacion, Amazon’s vice president of worldwide corporate development. “We know there are companies out there that share our curiosity and excitement to invent. Whether our investment helps them grow or leads them to work with Amazon, or both, we’re excited to help advance these technologies as online shopping becomes even more important to people who are looking for more convenience and time savings.”The Amazon Industrial Innovation Fund will invest in companies that imagine solutions that incrementally increase delivery speed and further improve the experience of employees working in warehousing and logistics fields.“These industries are inherently complex,” said Ceballos. “With our scale, Amazon is committed to investing in companies that will ignite innovation in emerging technologies that can help improve employee experiences and safety while seamlessly coexisting with workforces across the supply chain, logistics, and other industries.”

Amazon has a history of investing in technologies within its operations that support employees and customers, like artificial intelligence, robotics, and other cutting-edge inventions. Some past improvements include robotic arms that perform repetitive tasks and new products in autonomous movement that can help transport larger items.“Investing in companies that are driving the next generation of industrial innovation can have impact across communities—globally, regionally, and locally,” said Bob O’Donnell, founder and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research. “It’s great to see Amazon make these investments in companies in the U.S. and around the world, as historically, ongoing investment in innovation has shown to have a positive economic impact.”Ceballos said that’s the goal. “Even as we have continually improved our operations to better the employee experience and enhanced safety through the development of new workstations with better ergonomics, we hope this fund opens the door for more collaboration,” said Ceballos.The Amazon Industrial Innovation Fund’s first round of investments is focused on wearable technology that enhances safety in fulfillment buildings and robotics designed to complement and coexist with people’s lives. Below are details about those innovations and the companies behind them:Modjoul: Founded in 2016 and based in Greenville, South Carolina, Modjoul is developing wearable safety technology that enables real-time, personalized alerts and recommendations aimed at reducing injuries, most notably musculoskeletal issues.Vimaan: Founded in 2017 and based in Santa Clara, California, Vimaan is developing computer vision and artificial intelligence solutions engineered to improve inventory management.Agility Robotics: Founded in 2015 and based in Corvallis, Oregon, Agility Robotics is developing a bi-pedal walking robot, Digit, that addresses the mobility limitations of traditional robots so that machines can assist people wherever they are.BionicHIVE: Founded in 2014 and based in Israel, BionicHIVE is developing an autonomous robotic solution that can adapt to existing shelving racks and boxes in warehouses and is capable of floor to ceiling functionality.Mantis Robotics: Founded in 2020 and based in San Francisco, Mantis Robotics is developing a tactile robotic arm that uses sensor technology to cohesively work alongside people.Learn more about the Amazon Industrial Innovation Fund.FAQsWhat are the goals of the fund? Are you taking applications?The AIIF will focus on companies of all stages, from early stage startups to more established companies that are developing innovative technologies to help advance and improve key areas in fulfillment operations, logistics, and supply chain management, such as safety. These could include companies working in the areas of robotics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, autonomy, and other emerging technologies. We are interested in speaking to companies meeting these criteria, and more information can be found on www.industrialinnovationfund.com, including how to reach the investment team.How much are you investing in each company? Will the investment be similar for future recipients?We are launching with a target of investing $1 billion in companies. The investment size will vary based on the opportunity and stage of growth.How many companies do you expect to invest in?The AIIF will focus on companies of all stages, from early stage startups to more established companies that are working on innovative solutions to help advance and improve fulfillment operations, logistics, and supply chain management. These could include companies working in the areas of robotics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, autonomy, and other emerging technologies. We are not targeting a specific number of companies; instead, we want to support high-quality companies that are addressing these challenging spaces.What types of technology will you focus on?While we have a wide view of innovation, our investments will focus on the areas of fulfillment operations, logistics, and supply chain management. These could include companies working in the areas of robotics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, autonomy, and other emerging technologies.Where will you invest?We will invest where the most interesting and innovative technologies exist. This is a global effort and is focused on companies innovating in fulfillment operations, logistics, and supply chain solutions, which could eventually improve our operations, while also enhancing our employee and customer experience.Which technologies from your initial investment announcement are you already using?The purpose of the AIIF is to help spur further innovation and scale the technologies each company is developing for the benefit of a range of industries and companies.

Amazon has launched its second humanitarian aid hub in Eastern Europe to help Ukrainian refugees, this time in Poland.

With more than 4 million Ukrainian refugees being forced to leave their country, the needs to support them are increasing every day. One week after the opening of the first humanitarian aid hub in Slovakia, we are adding a second humanitarian aid hub in Poland dedicated to getting much-needed supplies to Ukrainian refugees.

A look inside one of Amazon's humanitarian aid hubs in Poland







The facility is near Sosnowiec, a city in southern Poland, and consists of 3,500 square meters (nearly 37,680 square feet) of warehouse space where our employees consolidate, pack, and ship millions of critical supplies. The supplies are being distributed to Ukrainian families in partnership with charities like Save The Children and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The addition of this new facility nearly doubles the space we’ve dedicated to procuring first-need products for those impacted, and the effort continues to be Amazon’s largest humanitarian operation to date.Amazon’s newest humanitarian hub expands on the ongoing relief efforts that we’ve supported in Poland since the beginning of the crisis in Ukraine. Amazon has donated close to $1 million to Polish organizations supporting refugees on the ground, in addition to $5 million in donations to global NGOs actively working in Poland like UNICEF, UNHCR, Red Cross, and Save the Children. We have also set up office space in our Development Center in Krakow to help 70 members of the World Food Program coordinate their efforts in the region.Amazon employees across Poland, which borders Ukraine, are also volunteering to help those in need. They’ve donated more than 17,500 blankets and helped provide meals to Ukrainian refugees in the cities of Gdansk, Warsaw, and Krakow, as well as in the villages of Hrebenne and Dorohusk, through Polish Humanitarian Action. The teams in our print-on-demand facility in Wrocław printed 1,400 children’s books in Ukrainian and, in partnership with the Gdansk’s Foundation, delivered them to community centers and apartments where Ukrainian parents and children have been staying.

We will continue to use Amazon’s infrastructure and technology to provide support to those impacted by this conflict.

New program provides $125,000 cash and up to $100,000 in AWS credits for early stage startups led by Black, women, Latino, and LGBTQIA+ founders, as well as training, mentoring, and technical guidance. 

In 2018, Claudius Mbemba (mem’buh), a Black man who grew up in Cameroon before moving to the United States, co-founded his first venture scale business—a managed marketplace app for vacation rental cleaning services called Neu (now Spritz). It gave him firsthand experience of the challenges of navigating the investing landscape. As someone from an underrepresented community, he’s seen how the pool of businesses that receive funding is often homogeneous. 






Claudius Mbemba, CTO and co-founder of Spritz (formerly Neu)

“It's all about the money flow. As soon as investors and those with access to opportunity start investing in a more diverse range of recipients, then we will start moving in the right direction,” said Mbemba. “It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. You get access to the capital, which creates incentives for investors to open up their networks to you, which can help your business meet the next milestone, which creates success. When people don't invest in founders from diverse backgrounds, they're not creating that momentum and not helping fulfill that prophecy. It comes down to that.” This funding gap, as well as difficulties accessing training, networking, and mentoring opportunities, are just some of the issues faced by underrepresented founders—like Mbemba—that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is committed to addressing. It’s why AWS is launching a new AWS Impact Accelerator that commits more than $30 million over the next three years to early stage startups led by Black, women, Latino, and LGBTQIA+ founders.Each qualifying startup receives up to $225,000 in combined cash and credits, training, mentoring, and technical guidance—as well as introductions to Amazon leaders and teams, networking opportunities with investors, and advisory support. Eligible startups can now apply to the first of these programs, the AWS Impact Accelerator for Black Founders.










How it works

""I've been in situations and cohorts where people tell me it's so easy to raise money,"" said Mbemba. ""And I'm thinking, ‘That's not the experience I'm having.’ Friends and family investing doesn't work for me. I don't have people who can just invest $100,000 to get my business off the ground."" To put this into perspective, studies consistently show that Black, women, Latino, and LGBTQIA+ startup founders are underrepresented across the total number of founded and funded startups. In 2021, U.S. startups founded solely by women raised nearly $6.4 billion in venture funding, according to PitchBook data. But that number only accounts for 2% of overall investment dollars that year, which was $330 billion. For example, according to StartOut, an organization that supports LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs, if everyone had equal access to funding and resources, there would be 10 times more LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs in the U.S. We spoke to Mbemba, an AWS customer, and two other startup founders who work with AWS, about their experiences of building successful businesses as a part of an underrepresented demographic, how strong partnerships and accelerator programs changed the game for them, and why more initiatives like AWS Impact Accelerator are vital. Marcus Bullock, CEO, FlikshopIn 2012, Marcus Bullock launched Flikshop, a platform that sends photos delivered as postcards to any person in any prison instantly, with an often difficult topic on his resume—a felony conviction. At the age of 15, Bullock entered a maximum-security prison to begin an eight-year sentence for carjacking a man in a parking lot. During this time, he said he cycled through “anger, frustration, and complete disillusionment.” What kept him afloat was regular correspondence from his mother. “She wanted me to understand that there was still life to be lived,” said Bullock. “And so, she made a commitment to send me photos and write me letters every day until I came home.” 






Marcus Bullock, CEO, Flikshop

That constant reminder of life on the other side continued to drive Bullock when he got out. He founded a painting business and used the profits to fund the development of Flikshop, an app built on AWS that lets anyone take a picture, write a message, and send it as a physical postcard to an incarcerated friend or loved one.Yet Bullock had no technical skills when he left prison. Inmates weren’t allowed to use computers, and when he began his sentence, the internet was still on the perimeter of mainstream culture. His only experience of it was through movies. “You think you understand what it does. But it didn’t really exist when I went in, and when I came home, there it was,” he said. “To go from nothing to suddenly being able to type anything into a search bar, and to have all this information pop up, was just the most mind-blowing experience ever. The whole world had changed.”His reaction? To dive right in. The more Bullock learned about developing applications for smartphones and the web, the more he learned what he needed to learn. Questions that tech insiders consider common parlance were alien to him at that point. “What does UX/UI mean? What are wireframes? How do we think about pricing? What is a server? What's the difference between hosting servers and cloud computing? I had a massive knowledge gap in trying to figure out how to launch,” he said. It’s a gap that Bullock has been incredibly successful in bridging. Flikshop has now shipped over 700,000 postcards to inmates in jails, prisons, juvenile facilities, and ICE detention centers around the country, and continues to grow 20% month over month. The company has also developed enterprise partnerships with Fortune 100 companies such as Boeing, Bank of America, and AWS. Looking back, when Bullock considers what advice he would have given himself when starting the business, one thing stands out—strengthen your network. “I didn't realize that having a felony would matter after I had proven I could generate revenue,” he said. “Or that not having access to social capital would differentiate me.” That's where accelerator programs and competitions changed the game. In 2018, Flikshop entered two incubator programs and finally developed the traction it needed to grow. Having singer John Legend’s campaign FreeAmerica partner with Bank of America and New Profit to invest in the business also helped. 










AWS helps diversify tech and entertainment

From haircuts to Master’s degrees—AWS provides tools and resources that facilitate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) opportunities for customers and institutions.

“You can't outwork relationships,” said Bullock. “No matter how incredible your product is, no matter how amazing the technology or the tool you’re able to introduce, no matter how incredible your marketing or strategy across platforms—relationships are what matter. It’s the people who become your advocates, supporters, and sponsors. It’s the people who kick down a door for you and say to someone, ‘Hey, you need to figure out a way to collaborate with Marcus.'"" Adriana Vazquez, CEO, Lilu When Adriana Vazquez started her smart garment company Lilu in 2017, she quickly found that the resources readily available to her Ivy League classmates were far harder for her—a woman and a Latina immigrant—to access. Recent Crunchbase data, for example, shows funding for early stage startups led by Latinx founders has almost completely stalled in the past few years. “Such a small percentage of venture capital funding goes to Black and Latina founders,” said Vazquez. “The odds are really stacked against us.” 






Adriana Vazquez, CEO, Lilu

Vazquez persisted. Leaning on technical degrees from both MIT and the University of Pennsylvania, she developed the first Lilu smart bra for breastfeeding mothers. Vazquez had seen so many of her women colleagues deal with the stress, even shame, of pumping—a critical task for any mother who needs to keep up her milk supply—while at work or on the go. Not only that, but most pumps were cumbersome and uncomfortable to use. “Technology should make people's lives better, easier, and bring joy into them,” she said. “I was surprised by how technology wasn't supporting moms as well as I knew it could.” Vazquez needed to prototype and get her product into customers’ hands, all of which required a great deal of testing and iteration, not to mention time and capital. In the beginning, Lilu was aided by grants and prizes in pitch competitions, but the boost it received from larger accelerators, and funding from America’s Seed Fund, a National Science Foundation program, really put her company in gear. “A good accelerator with a good program, really early on, can make such a big difference,"" she said. “So many founders don't have necessary resources, connections, or access to capital. But these are the things that make the impossible possible. We have people innovating from all cultures and parts of the world, and they typically don't have access.” 










Women founders: How to beat bias to get backing for your business

When it comes to raising capital for your startup, the gender gap remains painfully real. Amazon Web Services invited five women entrepreneurs to tell us how they prevailed.




Read more
















Vazquez noted too how AWS, even before the launch of the Impact Accelerator, kept the door open—helping her hone her pitch and connecting her to resources that could move Lilu closer to its goals. “AWS has always given me a platform to talk about what I'm doing,” she said. Claudius Mbemba, CTO and co-founder of Spritz (formerly Neu)Claudius Mbemba, who grew up in Cameroon and immigrated to the U.S., saw from a young age how technology could improve lives in his country of birth. He showed an early talent for shaping technology as he saw fit, writing computer programming scripts and even hacking a gaming system his father bought. “I was fascinated with technology and how it could enable me to access and create the things that I wanted to see in the world,” said Mbemba. That drive eventually led him to major in computer science at Ohio State University, before working as a software engineer. He later co-founded Neu, a business that helped connect vacation rental owners with housecleaners, the way Uber connects drivers and passengers.“I've always had a knack for spotting things that could be better and solving that problem,” he said. 










AWS empowers startups solving critical challenges in the cloud 

Amazon Web Services is launching two AWS Global Accelerator programs to help startups address some of the world’s most pressing challenges while building successful, cloud-based businesses.




Read more
















Today, Mbemba is engaged in a huge pivot, transforming Neu into a new business called Spritz—a software as a service (SaaS) platform that provides housecleaning professionals with the tools they need to grow and manage their operations, such as back-office functions, operations, logistics, and administrative tasks. To do this, the company needed advisors and a broader field of investors who share Mbemba’s experience and deeply understand the business. “It's about having representation and investors and mentors understanding the technology and business model,” he said. Mbemba points out that immigrants and entrepreneurs share an important quality—making big, bold leaps. He has an adage when it comes to taking the plunge, as he’s done many times in his life. “The sooner you start, the sooner you finish,” he said. “Often, prospective entrepreneurs and business leaders will delay because they don't know how exactly to make a change. On the startup journey, you will encounter ‘unknown unknowns.’ Those unknowns are best solved by just doing the thing.” AWS Impact Accelerator The AWS Impact Accelerator gives high-potential, pre-seed startups the tools and knowledge to reach key milestones such as raising funds or being accepted to a seed-stage accelerator program, while creating powerful solutions in the cloud. Participants accepted into the eight-week program will create a wide-ranging, personalized training curriculum from dozens of available sessions delivered by AWS startup experts and guest speakers, and will also learn how to use Amazon processes such as “two-way door decision making” and “working backwards” to drive day-to-day decisions and build nimble, innovative teams. Applications are now open for the first AWS Impact Accelerator for Black Founders, with the program kicking off in June for U.S.-based startups. The first AWS Impact Accelerator for Women Founders will take place in the second half of the year for U.S.-based startups, and the AWS Impact Accelerators for LGBTQIA+ Founders and Latino Founders respectively will follow in 2023.Read the press release for more information.

The company announces 37 new renewable energy projects totaling 3.5 GW of clean energy capacity. 

Amazon is continuing to scale its renewable energy investments with 37 new renewable energy projects around the world, marking significant progress on its path to power 100% of its operations with renewable energy by 2025—five years ahead of the original target of 2030. The new projects increase the capacity of Amazon’s renewable energy portfolio by nearly 30%, from 12.2 gigawatts (GW) to 15.7 GW, and bring the total number of renewable energy projects to 310 across 19 countries.The additional 3.5 GW of clean energy capacity from these new projects extends Amazon’s leadership position as the world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy, and advances its efforts to meet The Climate Pledge, a commitment to be net-zero carbon by 2040—10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement.



These projects will generate enough carbon-free energy annually to avoid emissions equivalent to more than 3.7 million cars in the U.S. each year.




“Our commitment to protecting the planet and limiting Amazon’s impact on the environment has led us to become the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world in both 2020 and 2021. Given the growth of our business, and our mission to run 100% of Amazon’s operations on renewable energy, we aren’t slowing our renewable investments down,” said Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon. “We now have 310 wind and solar projects across 19 countries, and are working hard to reach our goal of powering 100% of our business on renewable energy by 2025—five years ahead of our original target of 2030.”The 37 new projects are located across the U.S., Spain, France, Australia, Canada, India, Japan, and the United Arab Emirates. They vary in project type and size, with three new wind farms, 26 new solar farms, and eight new rooftop solar installations at company buildings around the world. As a result of these projects, Amazon now has a total of 310 renewable energy projects, including 134 wind and solar farms and 176 rooftop solar projects.










Data helps AWS customers cut their carbon emissions

AWS's new tool makes it easy for customers to monitor, analyze, and reduce their carbon footprint.

Once operational, Amazon’s 310 projects are expected to produce 42,000 gigawatt hours (GWh) of renewable energy each year—enough electricity output to power 3.9 million U.S. homes annually. The carbon-free energy generated by these projects will also help avoid 17.3 million metric tons of carbon emissions annually, avoiding the equivalent of the annual emissions of more than 3.7 million cars in the U.S. each year.Amazon also continues to invest in renewable energy projects paired with energy storage. The energy storage systems allow Amazon to store clean energy produced by its solar projects and deploy it when solar energy is not available, such as in the evening hours, or during periods of high demand. This strengthens the climate impact of Amazon’s clean energy portfolio by enabling carbon-free electricity throughout more parts of the day. The new projects include a 300-megawatt (MW) solar project paired with 150 MW of battery storage in Arizona and a 150 MW solar project paired with 75 MW of battery storage in California. Combined, the two projects double Amazon’s total announced solar paired with energy storage from 220 MW to 445 MW.“Amazon continues to be a leader in rapidly scaling up renewable energy projects here in the U.S. This increasingly includes hybrid projects that pair energy storage with renewable energy generation, unlocking the ability to use clean reliable energy throughout all hours of the day,” said Heather Zichal, CEO of the American Clean Power Association.










Sustainable buildings

Amazon is designing buildings that help lead the industry toward net-zero carbon, while improving the resource efficiency of our facilities and prioritizing the health and wellness of our building occupants.

Below are more details about the latest series of renewable energy projects, which will supply clean energy for Amazon’s operations, including its corporate offices, fulfillment centers, and Amazon Web Services data centers that support millions of customers globally.23 projects in the U.S., spread across 13 statesThe new projects bring Amazon’s total clean energy procurement in the U.S. from 7.2 GW to 10.4 GW. Notably, the new projects include Amazon’s largest renewable energy project (by capacity) announced to date, which is a 500 MW solar farm in Texas. The announcement also includes the company’s first renewable energy projects in Missouri. The remaining projects are in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Virginia.Five new projects in SpainThe company added an additional 314 MW of renewable energy capacity in Spain, bringing its total investment to 1.4 GW in the country. The five new projects include three solar farms and two wind farms, bringing Amazon’s total renewable energy projects in Spain to 14.A second renewable energy project in FranceAmazon announced its second solar project in France, which brings the company’s total renewable energy capacity announced to date to 38 MW in the country.Eight additional rooftop solar projectsThe company added its first rooftop solar project in the United Arab Emirates, which is a 2.7 MW installation in Dubai. Amazon also announced seven rooftop solar projects in Australia, Canada, India, and Japan totaling over 5 MW of clean energy capacity.Learn more about Amazon’s renewable energy projects around the world by visiting the company’s renewable energy project interactive map.Miranda Ballentine, CEO of the Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA), said: “As number one on CEBA’s Deal Tracker Top 10 for the second year in a row, Amazon continues to demonstrate its commitment to advancing clean energy. Amazon’s recent announcement highlights the increasingly sophisticated strategies used by energy customers to deploy carbon-free energy projects across the nation and the world, and the critical role energy customers play in optimizing emissions reductions.”










The Climate Pledge announces nearly 100 new signatories

More than 300 businesses across 51 industries and 29 countries have now joined The Climate Pledge and committed to meet the Paris Agreement 10 years early.




Watch now
















Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge in 2019, committing to reach net-zero carbon by 2040—10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. The Pledge now has more than 300 signatories, including Best Buy, IBM, Microsoft, PepsiCo, Siemens, Unilever, Verizon, and Visa.To reach its goal, Amazon will continue to reduce emissions across its operations by taking real business actions and establishing a path to power its operations with 100% renewable energy, five years ahead of the company’s original target of 2030. Amazon is also delivering on its Shipment Zero vision to make all Amazon shipments net-zero carbon, with 50% net-zero carbon by 2030, and purchasing 100,000 electric delivery vehicles, the largest order ever of electric delivery vehicles. The company is also investing $2 billion in the development of decarbonizing services and solutions through the Climate Pledge Fund.Learn more about The Climate Pledge and Amazon’s sustainability efforts.

Whether customers are ordering chilled or frozen foods from Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market will arrive insulated in packaging that is easy and convenient for customers to recycle at home.Moving to all curbside-recyclable insulation packaging reduces material waste and each year replaces approximately 735,000 pounds of plastic film, 3.15 million pounds of natural cotton fiber, and 15 million pounds of non-recyclable mixed plastic. The new packaging is also produced regionally in the U.S., enabling us to deliver it to Amazon Fresh grocery hubs, stores, and Whole Foods Market locations with fewer miles traveled across the supply chain.

I’m excited and optimistic about the feedback we’re hearing from customers. One customer shared with us this great sentiment: “Absolutely LOVEEEE the new cold foods packaging you are using! Prefer it over the non-recyclable ‘cooler bags.’ And my food was just as cold! Thank you for taking care of our environment.”This new packaging is just the latest step in Amazon’s commitment to both The Climate Pledge, a bold commitment to be net-zero carbon across our business by 2040, and to building a sustainable business for our employees, customers, and the planet. We couldn’t have done it without Joe Rake, who spearheaded the new project while a senior program manager on the grocery delivery packaging team.I recently sat down to talk with Rake, who shared some great behind-the-scenes insights about the project that I want to share with you. We know that addressing the global crisis of climate change will take a combination of big, bold commitments and everyday actions. We’re doing both as we build an environmentally sustainable business and support the communities where we live and work.How would you describe the problem we were trying to solve for customers?We have long wanted to find a more sustainable solution for the plastic liners and bubble bags that are often used to insulate chilled and frozen items. The criteria for any new packaging solution came down to five key considerations. First, and probably the most obvious, we wanted to ensure the packaging maintained product chill chain and Amazon’s high bar for food safety.

Second, the packaging needed to be small, compact, and flexible for our delivery drivers. Think of it as fitting multiple grocery bags into the trunk of a Prius, so switching to stiff cardboard boxes for insulation wouldn’t work. Although they’d maintain food-safe temperatures, boxes would take up more room, which would mean fewer grocery deliveries per vehicle, ultimately resulting in more vehicles—and carbon emissions.The third major consideration was that any new packaging needed to be easily recyclable—as in, customers could leave it with the rest of their curbside recyclable material. Fourth, it also needed to be inexpensive and scalable because we wanted to continue to ensure that Amazon’s grocery delivery offerings were widely accessible for customers.And finally, we wanted to generate less overall packaging for customers. We are continually inventing new packaging solutions, and sometimes the simplest action is to use less of it, especially when Mother Nature provides her own “chill chain” in colder months.How did you and the team go about getting started?We started by taking a lot of inspiration from past sustainable packaging innovations at Amazon. Our teams are constantly working on ways to minimize waste, increase recycling, and provide options for customers to reuse, repair, and recycle their products. The goal is to send less material to the landfill and more back into the circular economy loop.

We also built on the progress we’d already made with grocery delivery packaging. In 2018, we introduced frozen water bottles as an alternative to frozen gel packs to provide a grocery insulation solution that’s widely recyclable or reusable by our customers. That step had a similar ethos to what we were looking to do with this new packaging initiative. And then in 2019, we started investigating a solution for the plastic liners and bubble-bag insulation. Nothing on the market was able to meet our physical, thermal, and sustainable design criteria, which started us on our journey to develop a solution ourselves.After a lot of rigorous testing and customer feedback, we landed on a version of recycled paper tissue layering that’s relatively common in the moving and packing industry but that we reinvented for our grocery delivery customers.How did you test the product and gather customer feedback?We tested the thermal effectiveness of the all-recyclable paper solution in our internal thermal labs, as well as in multiple external labs in North America and Europe, to validate it met the needs of our delivery chill chain. The chill chain is the process of keeping frozen foods frozen, and refrigerated products chilled, at the correct temperature until the end of a customer’s delivery window.In this controlled environment, we tested worst-case scenarios in temperature barriers and how changing the thickness, or “wadding,” of the packaging would affect the outcome of the results. Once we started seeing consistent results in the lab, we moved to the pilot stage in 2020. We conducted pilots in multiple cities and under a variety of temperature scenarios.At the same time, as we slowly rolled this out, our food safety team conducted secret-shopper programs to validate the thermal effectiveness of the packaging. We also paid very close attention to customer feedback along with employee feedback on how to best pack orders using the new packaging.Why is this packaging unique to the grocery delivery industry?As the leader of grocery delivery, we recognized an urgent need to find sustainable solutions that can eliminate hard-to-recycle materials—and we are proud to be focused on scaling these solutions. This recyclable packaging will hopefully inspire others, both at Amazon and elsewhere, to continue finding creative, sustainable solutions for customers and communities around the world.Learn more about Amazon's efforts to improve our packaging and reduce waste.

When her son was diagnosed with autism during the pandemic, Ginny turned to Alexa: “He gets a lot of joy from being heard and understood like that.”

Autism impacts more than 5 million people in the U.S. While it looks different for every person, the developmental disorder often affects a person’s skills in communication, self-regulation, and self-expression.At 18 months old, Zach was diagnosed with autism. Not long after, his mother Ginny and the rest of the family began speech therapy with him. To Ginny’s surprise, the Echo devices she already had throughout her home took on an entirely new, important role in her family.







Read more about Ginny’s story, in her own words:My son, Zach, was diagnosed with autism at 18 months old. Ever since he could walk, he’s been obsessed with Alexa. Before we even had kids, my husband and I had started buying Echo devices to play music, and by the time Zach was born, we had them all over the house.It was toward the beginning of the pandemic when Zach was diagnosed with autism. My husband and I found ourselves on our own managing Zach’s speech therapy virtually. Zach is nonspeaking and struggles with social interactions, so one of the key outcomes of his therapy is increasing receptive language and encouraging joint attention—the kind of back and forth you have in a conversation with someone. We already knew how much Zach loved Alexa, so incorporating Alexa into this process seemed like a really natural step.







We have a device called an AAC we use to encourage Zach’s communication behaviors. The way this works is that Zach can press buttons that correlate to certain words and phrases, and the device generates an electronic voice that expresses those words and phrases out loud. For Zach, we created an Alexa button on this device, as well as buttons for some of Zach’s favorite things to ask Alexa. In particular, he loves the ""Animal Sounds"" skill, so he’ll press the right combination of buttons and the generated voice will ask Alexa to play an animal sound of Zach’s choice. When Alexa responds to his electronic voice, Zach gets so excited. He lights up immediately and starts running around—he gets a lot of joy from being heard and understood like that.As a family, we love playing kids games with Alexa. In these games, Alexa prompts you with a question and waits for you to respond—and we use them as a way to encourage Zach’s speech development. When Alexa pauses, it’s signaling to Zach that it’s holding space for him to respond, and over time that teaches him to have that back and forth. Zach loves Alexa so much that playing these games has made his therapy less work and more PLAY! Playing with Alexa while learning is a huge motivator for him.

Just a few weeks ago, Zach said his first “real” word. That’s a huge milestone for any parent, but for us it was even bigger. Zach’s first word was “animal,” and he was talking to Alexa, asking to play ""Animal Sounds.""We even have an Echo in Zach’s bedroom, and every night I initiate his bedtime routine. We’ve made him an Amazon Music playlist, called “Zach’s Lullaby Playlist,” and Zach will signal to us every night when he’s ready for us to get his bedtime routine underway.Alexa has become such an important part of our lives—these days Alexa even comes on vacation with us, because we don’t want to be without such an important part of our routine. When I think back on my husband and I buying Echo devices, I’m just amazed at how essential Alexa has become to us, in a way we never could have foreseen. Alexa has been such an immensely useful tool, and we’re so grateful to have it.   Learn more about how you can incorporate Alexa into your family’s life, or read more about Alexa’s accessibility features.If you have a story of your own about how you use Alexa, we'd love to hear it, and we will continue sharing some of our favorite #AlexaStories.

Super Spy Ryan Game Trailer | Amazon Kids+ Original







Developed in collaboration with the Kaji Family, the teams at Ryan’s World, p.w Games, and Amber Studio, Super Spy Ryan takes everything kids love from the Amazon Kids+ Original special of the same name and brings it to life in a fun, kid-safe, multiplayer romp for ages 6-9+.In the game, players compete to find out who can rescue the most stolen birthday gifts from the evil Packrat’s lair. Standing in their way are Packrat’s patrolling henchmen; if they catch you, they’ll make you drop all the presents you are carrying. At launch, the game features six different playable characters from the Ryan’s World Universe, each with special unique gameplay abilities—like Gus’ slime cannon and X-ray goggles that reveal players hiding in ball pits.Super Spy Ryan offers a deep multiplayer experience designed with kid safety in mind—there are no friend lists or chat features, and all players have anonymous Spy-themed usernames. Parents and guardians can also put the game in “Single Player Mode,” so players only compete against computer-controlled players. There is also a kid-safe “Party Mode” where players on the same Wi-Fi network can play together, if they share the super-secret special code.Make music with ""Do, Re & Mi""The Do, Re & Mi mobile game was developed in collaboration with About Fun and the team behind the Amazon Kids+ Original series Do, Re & Mi on Prime Video. Contributors to the game include stars from the show like Kristen Bell and Jackie Tohnz who helped adapt the hit series into a music education game designed for preschoolers ages 3-5. They were involved in helping to shape everything from the selection of activities to the specific music education curriculum that is covered in the “Music Maestro” lessons, with the hopes of inspiring a new generation of musicians and songwriters.The game features a variety of activities that teach kids how to play songs on the piano or the bongos, learning about the basics of reading sheet music, and fun musical concepts such as solos and duets. Kids can also “produce” their own music in the studio by mixing and matching different instrumental loops with recordings of them playing instruments in the game, with the ability to even add their own vocals.

The Amazon U.S. disaster relief hub in Atlanta, Georgia is partnering with a medical non-governmental organization to send supplies to doctors and nurses on the front lines.

In addition to standing up humanitarian aid hubs in Slovakia and Poland in support of Ukraine, Amazon has teamed up with global humanitarian relief partner International Medical Corps to donate and deliver more than 30,000 critical medical supplies from Amazon’s disaster relief hub in Atlanta, Georgia to hospitals in Ukraine.Amazon’s shipment of 18 pallets includes essential medical supplies and equipment including first-aid kits, medical face shields, surgical gowns, and thermometers, as well as items like towels, tents, water filters, cots, and portable handwashing stations. Within 24 hours of receiving the request, we were able to ship the pallets out because they were previously packed and pre-positioned in Atlanta to specifically support International Medical Corps in case a humanitarian relief situation arose.







In addition to the items donated, Amazon is employing its global logistics network and covering the cost of airlifting the medical supplies from Atlanta to Vienna, Austria. The International Medical Corps field operations team stationed in Vienna will then work to distribute the donated aid items directly to hospitals in Ukraine, so doctors and nurses can immediately use them to assist patients.Amazon’s disaster relief hub in Atlanta, Georgia opened in 2021 to be able to support front-line humanitarian aid partners quickly when a global natural disaster occurred. The hub is stocked with hundreds of thousands of Amazon-donated relief supplies in a 10,000-cubic foot fulfillment center space—enough to fill an Amazon Air 767 cargo plane—and all of which can immediately provide critical support when a natural disaster strikes.Learn more about Amazon’s disaster relief hub and what Amazon is doing to provide humanitarian support to the people of Ukraine.

18,"April 21, 2022",Amazon launches its first Amazon Kids+ Original mobile games,"



Dear shareholders:Over the past 25 years at Amazon, I’ve had the opportunity to write many narratives, emails, letters, and keynotes for employees, customers, and partners. But, this is the first time I’ve had the honor of writing our annual shareholder letter as CEO of Amazon. Jeff set the bar high on these letters, and I will try to keep them worth reading.When the pandemic started in early 2020, few people thought it would be as expansive or long-running as it’s been. Whatever role Amazon played in the world up to that point became further magnified as most physical venues shut down for long periods of time and people spent their days at home. This meant that hundreds of millions of people relied on Amazon for PPE, food, clothing, and various other items that helped them navigate this unprecedented time. Businesses and governments also had to shift, practically overnight, from working with colleagues and technology on-premises to working remotely. AWS played a major role in enabling this business continuity. Whether companies saw extraordinary demand spikes, or demand diminish quickly with reduced external consumption, the cloud’s elasticity to scale capacity up and down quickly, as well as AWS’s unusually broad functionality helped millions of companies adjust to these difficult circumstances. Our AWS and Consumer businesses have had different demand trajectories during the pandemic. In the first year of the pandemic, AWS revenue continued to grow at a rapid clip—30% year over year (“YoY”) in 2020 on a $35 billion annual revenue base in 2019—but slower than the 37% YoY growth in 2019. This was due in part to the uncertainty and slowing demand that so many businesses encountered, but also in part to our helping companies optimize their AWS footprint to save money. Concurrently, companies were stepping back and determining what they wanted to change coming out of the pandemic. Many concluded that they didn’t want to continue managing their technology infrastructure themselves, and made the decision to accelerate their move to the cloud. This shift by so many companies (along with the economy recovering) helped re-accelerate AWS’s revenue growth to 37% YoY in 2021.Conversely, our Consumer revenue grew dramatically in 2020. In 2020, Amazon’s North America and International Consumer revenue grew 39% YoY on the very large 2019 revenue base of $245 billion; and, this extraordinary growth extended into 2021 with revenue increasing 43% YoY in Q1 2021. These are astounding numbers. We realized the equivalent of three years’ forecasted growth in about 15 months.As the world opened up again starting in late Q2 2021, and more people ventured out to eat, shop, and travel, consumer spending returned to being spread over many more entities. We weren’t sure what to expect in 2021, but the fact that we continued to grow at double digit rates (with a two-year Consumer compounded annual growth rate of 29%) was encouraging as customers appreciated the role Amazon played for them during the pandemic, and started using Amazon for a larger amount of their household purchases.This growth also created short-term logistics and cost challenges. We spent Amazon’s first 25 years building a very large fulfillment network, and then had to double it in the last 24 months to meet customer demand. As we were bringing this new capacity online, the labor market tightened considerably, making it challenging both to receive all of the inventory our vendors and sellers wanted to send us and to place that inventory as close to customers as we typically do. Combined with ocean, air, and trucking capacity becoming scarcer and more expensive, this created extra transportation and productivity costs. Supply chains were disrupted in ways none of us had seen previously. We hoped that the major impact from COVID-19 would recede as 2021 drew to a close, but then omicron reared its head in December, which had worldwide ramifications, including impacting people’s ability to work. And then in late February, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, fuel costs and inflation became bigger issues with which to contend.So, 2021 was a crazy and unpredictable year, continuing a trend from 2020. But, I’m proud of the incredible commitment and effort from our employees all over the world. I’m not sure any of us would have gotten through the pandemic the same way without the dedication and extraordinary efforts shown by our teams during this period, and I’m eternally grateful.It’s not normal for a company of any size to be able to respond to something as discontinuous and unpredictable as this pandemic turned out to be. What is it about Amazon that made it possible for us to do so? It’s because we weren’t starting from a standing start. We had been iterating on and remaking our fulfillment capabilities for nearly two decades. In every business we pursue, we’re constantly experimenting and inventing. We’re divinely discontented with customer experiences, whether they’re our own or not. We believe these customer experiences can always be better, and we strive to make customers’ lives better and easier every day. The beauty of this mission is that you never run out of runway; customers always want better, and our job is both to listen to their feedback and to imagine what else is possible and invent on their behalf.People often assume that the game-changing inventions they admire just pop out of somebody’s head, a light bulb goes off, a team executes to that idea, and presto—you have a new invention that’s a breakaway success for a long time. That’s rarely, if ever, how it happens. One of the lesser known facts about innovative companies like Amazon is that they are relentlessly debating, re-defining, tinkering, iterating, and experimenting to take the seed of a big idea and make it into something that resonates with customers and meaningfully changes their customer experience over a long period of time. Let me give you some Amazon examples. Our Fulfillment Network: Going back to the pandemic, there’s no way we could have started working on our fulfillment network in March 2020 and satisfied anything close to what our customers needed. We’d been innovating in our fulfillment network for 20 years, constantly trying to shorten the time to get items to customers. In the early 2000s, it took us an average of 18 hours to get an item through our fulfillment centers and on the right truck for shipment. Now, it takes us two. To deliver as reliably and cost-effectively as we desire, and to serve Amazon Prime members expecting shipments in a couple of days, we spent years building out an expansive set of fulfillment centers, a substantial logistics and transportation capability, and reconfigured how we did virtually everything in our facilities. For perspective, in 2004, we had seven fulfillment centers in the U.S. and four in other parts of the world, and we hadn’t yet added delivery stations, which connect our fulfillment and sortation centers to the last-mile delivery vans you see driving around your neighborhood. Fast forward to the end of 2021, we had 253 fulfillment centers, 110 sortation centers, and 467 delivery stations in North America, with an additional 157 fulfillment centers, 58 sortation centers, and 588 delivery stations across the globe. Our delivery network grew to more than 260,000 drivers worldwide, and our Amazon Air cargo fleet has more than 100 aircraft. This has represented a capital investment of over $100 billion and countless iterations and small process improvements by over a million Amazonians in the last decade and a half.Ironically, just before COVID started, we’d made the decision to invest billions of incremental dollars over several years to deliver an increasing number of Prime shipments in one day. This initiative was slowed by the challenges of the pandemic, but we’ve since resumed our focus here. Delivering a substantial amount of shipments in one day is hard (especially across the millions of items that we offer) and initially expensive as we build out the infrastructure to scale this efficiently. But, we believe our over 200 million Prime customers, who will tell you very clearly that faster is almost always better, will love this. So, this capability to ship millions of items within a couple days (and increasingly one day) was not from one aha moment and not developed in a year or two. It’s been hard-earned by putting ourselves in the shoes of our customers, knowing what they wanted, organizing Amazonians to work together to invent better solutions, and investing a large amount of financial and people resources over 20 years (often well in advance of when it would payout). This type of iterative innovation is never finished and has periodic peaks in investment years, but leads to better long-term customer experiences, customer loyalty, and returns for our shareholders.AWS: As we were defining AWS and working backwards on the services we thought customers wanted, we kept triggering one of the biggest tensions in product development—where to draw the line on functionality in V1. One early meeting in particular—for our core compute service called Elastic Compute Cloud (""EC2"")—was scheduled for an hour, and took three, as we animatedly debated whether we could launch a compute service without an accompanying persistent block storage companion (a form of network attached storage). Everybody agreed that having a persistent block store was important to a complete compute service; however, to have one ready would take an extra year. The question became could we offer customers a useful service where they could get meaningful value before we had all the features we thought they wanted? We decided that the initial launch of EC2 could be feature-poor if we also organized ourselves to listen to customers and iterate quickly. This approach works well if you indeed iterate quickly; but, is disastrous if you can’t. We launched EC2 in 2006 with one instance size, in one data center, in one region of the world, with Linux operating system instances only (no Windows), without monitoring, load balancing, auto-scaling, or yes, persistent storage. EC2 was an initial success, but nowhere near the multi-billion-dollar service it’s become until we added the missing capabilities listed above, and then some.In the early days of AWS, people sometimes asked us why compute wouldn’t just be an undifferentiated commodity. But, there’s a lot more to compute than just a server. Customers want various flavors of compute (e.g. server configurations optimized for storage, memory, high-performance compute, graphics rendering, machine learning), multiple form factors (e.g. fixed instance sizes, portable containers, serverless functions), various sizes and optimizations of persistent storage, and a slew of networking capabilities. Then, there’s the CPU chip that runs in your compute. For many years, the industry had used Intel or AMDx86 processors. We have important partnerships with these companies, but realized that if we wanted to push price and performance further (as customers requested), we’d have to develop our own chips, too. Our first generalized chip was Graviton, which we announced in 2018. This helped a subset of customer workloads run more cost-effectively than prior options. But, it wasn’t until 2020, after taking the learnings from Graviton and innovating on a new chip, that we had something remarkable with our Graviton2 chip, which provides up to 40% better price-performance than the comparable latest generation x86 processors. Think about how much of an impact 40% improvement on compute is. Compute is used for every bit of technology. That’s a huge deal for customers. And, while Graviton2 has been a significant success thus far (48 of the top 50 AWS EC2 customers have already adopted it), the AWS Chips team was already learning from what customers said could be better, and announced Graviton3 this past December (offering a 25% improvement on top of Graviton2’s relative gains). The list of what we’ve invented and delivered for customers in EC2 (and AWS in general) is pretty mind-boggling, and this iterative approach to innovation has not only given customers much more functionality in AWS than they can find anywhere else (which is a significant differentiator), but also allowed us to arrive at the much more game-changing offering that AWS is today.Devices: Our first foray into devices was the Kindle, released in 2007. It was not the most sophisticated industrial design (it was creamy white in color and the corners were uncomfortable for some people to hold), but revolutionary because it offered customers the ability to download any of over 90,000 books (now millions) in 60 seconds—and we got better and faster at building attractive designs. Shortly thereafter, we launched a tablet, and then a phone (with the distinguishing feature of having front-facing cameras and a gyroscope to give customers a dynamic perspective along with varied 3D experiences). The phone was unsuccessful, and though we determined we were probably too late to this party and directed these resources elsewhere, we hired some fantastic long-term builders and learned valuable lessons from this failure that have served us well in devices like Echo and FireTV. When I think of the first Echo device—and what Alexa could do for customers at that point—it was noteworthy, yet so much less capable than what’s possible today. Today, there are hundreds of millions of Alexa-enabled devices out there (in homes, offices, cars, hotel rooms, Amazon Echo devices, and third-party manufacturer devices); you can listen to music—or watch videos now; you can control your lights and home automation; you can create routines like “Start My Day” where Alexa tells you the weather, your estimated commute time based on current traffic, then plays the news; you can easily order retail items on Amazon; you can get general or customized news, updates on sporting events and related stats—and we’re still quite early with respect to what Alexa and Alexa-related devices will do for customers. Our goal is for Alexa to be the world’s most helpful and resourceful personal assistant, who makes people’s lives meaningfully easier and better. We have a lot more inventing and iterating to go, but customers continue to indicate that we’re on the right path. We have several other devices at varying stages of evolution (e.g. Ring and Blink provide the leading digital home security solutions, Astro is a brand new home robot that we just launched in late 2021), but it’s safe to say that every one of our devices, whether you’re talking about Kindle, FireTV, Alexa/Echo, Ring, Blink, or Astro is an invention-in-process with a lot more coming that will keep improving customers’ lives.Prime Video: We started in 2006 with an offering called Amazon Unbox where customers could download about a thousand movies from major studios. This made sense as bandwidth was slower those days (it would take an hour to download a video). But, as bandwidth got much faster to people’s homes and mobile devices, along with the advent of connected TVs, streaming was going to be a much better customer solution, and we focused our efforts on streaming. In 2011, we started offering over 5,000 streaming movies and shows as part of customers’ Amazon Prime subscriptions. Initially, all of our content was produced by other studios and entertainment companies. These deals were expensive, country-specific, and only available to us for a limited period; so, to expand our options, we started creating our own original shows. Our early efforts included short-lived shows like Alpha House and Betas, before we had our first award-winning series in Transparent, and eventually created multi-year franchises in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, The Boys, Bosch, and Jack Ryan. Along the way, we’ve learned a lot about producing compelling entertainment with memorable moments and using machine learning and other inventive technology to provide a superior-quality streaming experience (with useful, relevant data about actors, TV shows, movies, music, or sports stats a click away in our unique X-Ray feature). You might have seen some of this in action in our recent new hit series, Reacher, and you’ll hopefully see it in our upcoming Lord of the Rings series launch (coming Labor Day 2022). We also expect that you’ll see this iterative invention when we launch Thursday Night Football, the NFL’s first weekly, prime time, streaming-only broadcast, airing exclusively on Prime Video starting in September 2022. Our agreement with the NFL is for 11 years, and we will work relentlessly over the next several years to reinvent the NFL viewing experience for football fans.This track record of frequent invention is not only why more sports entities are choosing to work with Prime Video, but also why so many large entertainment companies have become Prime Video Channels partners. Channels is a program that enables entertainment companies to leverage Prime Video’s unique technology and viewing experience, as well as its very large member base to offer monthly subscriptions to their content. Companies like Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount, Starz, Corus Entertainment, and Globo have found that they’re driving substantial incremental membership and better customer experience through Channels. While there is so much progress in Prime Video from where we started, we have more invention in front of us in the next 15 years than the last 15—and our team is passionately committed to providing customers with the most expansive collection of compelling content anywhere in the world. This same sort of iterative invention can be applied to efforts supporting people and communities. Last summer, we added two new Leadership Principles: Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer and Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility. These concepts were always implicit at Amazon, but explicit Leadership Principles help us ask ourselves—and empower more Amazonians at all levels to ask—whether we’re living up to these principles.For example, more than a million Amazonians work in our fulfillment network. In 2018, we championed the $15 minimum wage (which is more than double the federal minimum wage), but haven’t stopped there. We continued to increase compensation such that our average starting hourly salary is currently over $18. Along with this compensation, we offer very robust benefits, including full health insurance, a 401K plan, up to 20 weeks of parental leave, and full tuition coverage for associates who want to get a college education (whether they remain with us or not). We’re not close to being done in how we improve the lives of our employees. We’ve researched and created a list of what we believe are the top 100 employee experience pain points and are systematically solving them. We’re also passionate about further improving safety in our fulfillment network, with a focus on reducing strains, sprains, falls, and repetitive stress injuries. Our injury rates are sometimes misunderstood. We have operations jobs that fit both the ""warehousing” and ""courier and delivery” categories. In the last U.S. public numbers, our recordable incident rates were a little higher than the average of our warehousing peers (6.4 vs. 5.5), and a little lower than the average of our courier and delivery peers (7.6 vs. 9.1). This makes us about average relative to peers, but we don’t seek to be average. We want to be best in class. When I first started in my new role, I spent significant time in our fulfillment centers and with our safety team, and hoped there might be a silver bullet that could change the numbers quickly. I didn’t find that. At our scale (we hired over 300,000 people in 2021 alone, many of whom were new to this sort of work and needed training), it takes rigorous analysis, thoughtful problem-solving, and a willingness to invent to get to where you want. We’ve been dissecting every process path to discern how we can further improve. We have a variety of programs in flight (e.g. rotational programs that help employees avoid spending too much time doing the same repetitive motions, wearables that prompt employees when they’re moving in a dangerous way, improved shoes to provide better toe protection, training programs on body mechanics, wellness, and safety practices). But, we still have a ways to go, and we’ll approach it like we do other customer experiences—we’ll keep learning, inventing, and iterating until we have more transformational results. We won’t be satisfied until we do.Similarly, at our scale, we have a significant carbon footprint. It’s a big part of why we created The Climate Pledge a few years ago (a pledge to be net-zero carbon by 2040, ten years ahead of the Paris Agreement). We’re making significant progress on this effort (we’re committed to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025—five years ahead of our original target of 2030, we have ordered over 100,000 electric vans to deliver packages, and have over 300 companies who’ve joined us in The Climate Pledge). But, we have a different challenge than most companies given the diversity and intensity of our operations (including shipping billions of packages per year). We’re committed to the challenge, but it will take relentless invention.We also are trying to increase the amount of affordable housing in the communities in which we have a large presence. Our more than $2 billion Housing Equity Fund that we started a year ago has already allocated $1.2 billion toward affordable housing initiatives in the areas around Washington state’s Puget Sound region, Arlington (Virginia), and Nashville (Tennessee).A final quick example is Kuiper, our low Earth orbit satellite network that we’re spending over $10 billion to build in the next several years. Kuiper will serve customers with minimal to no fixed broadband connectivity, changing access to information and resources for many communities (analysts estimate approximately 300-400 million customers globally are in this category). We’re optimistic that there is a pretty good business model for us too, but we’ll see—and it’s a real game changer for underserved families and businesses that will unfold over many years as we keep evolving its capabilities.  This type of iterative innovation is pervasive across every team at Amazon. I could have given comparable examples in Advertising, Grocery, Gaming, Amazon Music, Amazon Care (our telemedicine offering), or Pharmacy, to name a few. All of these stories are still being written as we rapidly experiment, learn, and continue to try to make our customer experience better every day.If this approach sounds appealing, a natural question is what’s required to get good at it? It’s easier said than done, but here are some components that have helped us:1/ Hire the Right Builders: We disproportionately index in hiring builders. We think of builders as people who like to invent, who look at customer experiences, dissect what doesn’t work well about them, and seek to reinvent them. We want people who keep asking why can’t it be done? We want people who like to experiment and tinker, and who realize launch is the starting line, not the finish line.2/ Organize Builders into Teams That Are as Separable and Autonomous as Possible: It’s hard for teams to be deep in what customers care about in multiple areas. It’s also hard to spend enough time on the new initiatives when there’s resource contention with the more mature businesses; the surer bets usually win out. Single-threaded teams will know their customers’ needs better, spend all their waking work hours inventing for them, and develop context and tempo to keep iterating quickly.3/ Give Teams the Right Tools and Permission to Move Fast: Speed is not pre-ordained. It’s a leadership choice. It has trade-offs, but you can’t wake up one day and start moving fast. It requires having the right tools to experiment and build fast (a major part of why we started AWS), allowing teams to make two-way door decisions themselves, and setting an expectation that speed matters. And, it does. Speed is disproportionally important to every business at every stage of its evolution. Those that move slower than their competitive peers fall away over time.4/ You Need Blind Faith, But No False Hope: This is a lyric from one of my favorite Foo Fighters songs (“Congregation”). When you invent, you come up with new ideas that people will reject because they haven’t been done before (that’s where the blind faith comes in), but it’s also important to step back and make sure you have a viable plan that’ll resonate with customers (avoid false hope). We’re lucky that we have builders who challenge each other, feedback loops that give us access to customer feedback, and a product development process of working backwards from the customer where having to write a Press Release (to flesh out the customer benefits) and a Frequently Asked Questions document (to detail how we’d build it) helps us have blind faith without false hope (at least usually).5/ Define a Minimum Loveable Product (MLP), and Be Willing to Iterate Fast: Figuring out where to draw the line for launch is one of the most difficult decisions teams must make. Often, teams wait too long, and insist on too many bells and whistles, before launching. And, they miss the first mover advantage or opportunity to build mindshare in fast-moving market segments before well-executing peers get too far ahead. The launch product must be good enough that you believe it’ll be loved from the get-go (why we call it a ""Minimum Loveable Product"" vs. a ""Minimum Viable Product""), but in newer market segments, teams are often better off getting this MLP to customers and iterating quickly thereafter.6/ Adopt a Long-term Orientation: We’re sometimes criticized at Amazon for not shutting much down. It’s true that we have a longer tolerance for our investments than most companies. But, we know that transformational invention takes multiple years, and if you’re making big bets that you believe could substantially change customer experience (and your company), you have to be in it for the long-haul or you’ll give up too quickly.7/ Brace Yourself for Failure: If you invent a lot, you will fail more often than you wish. Nobody likes this part, but it comes with the territory. When it’s clear that we’ve launched something that won’t work, we make sure we’ve learned from what didn’t go well, and secure great landing places for team members who delivered well—or your best people will hesitate to work on new initiatives.   Albert Einstein is sometimes credited with describing compound interest as the eighth wonder of the world (""He who understands it, earns it. He who doesn’t, pays it""). We think of iterative innovation in much the same way. Iterative innovation creates magic for customers. Constantly inventing and improving products for customers has a compounding effect on the customer experience, and in turn on a business’s prospects. Time is your friend when you are compounding gains. Amazon is a big company with some large businesses, but it’s still early days for us. We will continue to be insurgent—inventing in businesses that we’re in, in new businesses that we’ve yet to launch, and in new ideas that we haven’t even imagined yet. It remains Day 1.Sincerely,Andy JassyPresident and Chief Executive OfficerAmazon.com, Inc.P.S. As we have always done, our original 1997 Shareholder Letter follows. What’s written there is as true today as it was in 1997.







To our shareholders:Amazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers, yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry.But this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.We have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without risk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.It’s All About the Long TermWe believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital.Our decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise.Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making approach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers.We will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions.We will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically, to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns, and to step up our investment in those that work best. We will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures.We will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages. Some of these investments will pay off, others will not, and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case.When forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our GAAP accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows, we’ll take the cash flows.We will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices (to the extent competitive pressures allow), so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long-term leadership investments.We will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture. We understand the importance of continually reinforcing a cost-conscious culture, particularly in a business incurring net losses.We will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long-term profitability and capital management. At this stage, we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving the potential of our business model.We will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees, and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash. We know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think like, and therefore must actually be, an owner.We aren’t so bold as to claim that the above is the “right” investment philosophy, but it’s ours, and we would be remiss if we weren’t clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.With this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our outlook for the future.Obsess Over CustomersFrom the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy- to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer customers gift certificates, 1-Click shopping℠, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling.By many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:Sales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million – an 838% increase.Cumulative customer accounts grew from 180,000 to 1,510,000 – a 738% increase.The percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to over 58% in the same period in 1997.In terms of audience reach, per Media Metrix, our Web site went from a rank of 90th to within the top 20.We established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America Online, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy.InfrastructureDuring 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic, sales, and service levels:Amazon.com’s employee base grew from 158 to 614, and we significantly strengthened our management team.Distribution center capacity grew from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet, including a 70% expansion of our Seattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in Delaware in November.Inventories rose to over 200,000 titles at year-end, enabling us to improve availability for our customers.Our cash and investment balances at year-end were $125 million, thanks to our initial public offering in May 1997 and our $75 million loan, affording us substantial strategic flexibility.Our EmployeesThe past year’s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com’s success.It’s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, “You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can’t choose two out of three”), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren’t meant to be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build Amazon.com.Goals for 1998We are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments.We now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about what we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.Jeffrey P. BezosFounder and Chief Executive OfficerAmazon.com, Inc.

Amazon Future Engineer surprised 250 students with news of the award—let’s meet a few of them.

Any 2022 high school graduate will tell you the last two years have been challenging. From online classes to virtual graduation ceremonies, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed every aspect of their education. But for one 2022 grad—Destiny Ogar, a senior at the Baltimore Leadership School for Young Women—the challenges went beyond the classroom. In early 2020, as the pandemic began to rage, her mother was severely injured in a car accident.“The reality of life being short and precious was magnified,” Ogar said. “Not only was I in the emotional turmoil that we all experienced during the early days of the pandemic, I also held the responsibility of caring for my mother, all while transitioning to online schooling and feeling that separation from my friends.”Despite all of the disruptions in her life, Ogar became even more achievement-driven, not losing her focus on academics and even pursuing virtual extracurricular activities, including a job-readiness program. Now, as one of the students selected to receive a $40,000 scholarship from Amazon Future Engineer, Ogar will attend North Carolina A&T State University in the fall.






Destiny Ogar, one of the students selected to receive a $40,000 scholarship from Amazon Future Engineer.

“Without this scholarship, I likely would not be able to attend my dream school,” she said. “This scholarship will open doors for me and allow me to pursue a career in technology.”As a young Black woman, Ogar dreams of being a trailblazer. She knows all about the inequities of the tech industry, and she’s determined to use her training in computer science as a tool for change.“A lot of people may not enter this field because they don’t see someone that looks like them,” she said. “People of color are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), so I hope that future generations of Black women will see themselves in me and as someone they can look up to.”Amazon awarded $40,000 scholarships to 250 students in 2022, for a total of $10 million, more than double the company’s commitment from previous years. Scholarship recipients will also receive a paid internship at Amazon after their freshman year of college to gain hands-on, practical work experience with mentorship from Amazon leaders. Since 2019, Amazon has awarded $22 million in scholarships through Amazon Future Engineer—our global philanthropic education program—to 550 U.S. high school seniors from underserved and historically underrepresented communities. Amazon Future Engineer selects recipients based on academic achievement, demonstrated leadership, community involvement, work experience, future goals, and financial need. This year’s recipients come from more than 30 states and U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico and, for the first time, an American military base in Europe. More than 70% of scholarship recipients identify as Black, Latinx, and Native American, and 50% identify as women, groups that are currently underrepresented in STEM.

Another Amazon Future Engineer Scholarship recipient, Victor Acuna, a senior at Marco Antonio Firebaugh High School in Lynwood, California, shares Ogar’s determination to help students understand the many pathways available to them and build the confidence to pursue those careers.At 12 years old, Acuna watched a sci-fi movie about computer programming and was immediately inspired, seeing the role of a programmer as an opportunity to shape the future. He researched computer science opportunities and was disheartened to find limited access to STEM programs in his community. To help drive change, Acuna created United We Code, an after-school computer science program that teaches elementary school students in his district how to code using Scratch, a coding language with a simple visual interface.“On my last day of teaching this semester, two students said they loved computer science and wanted to become coders,” Acuna recalled. “For me, this confirmed that it isn’t that people of color aren’t interested in STEM, but rather, there aren’t enough resources in place to offer people like me access to computer science opportunities.”






Victor Acuna, one of the students selected to receive a $40,000 scholarship from Amazon Future Engineer.

Acuna, who is the oldest of four siblings and a first-generation college student, will begin his freshman year at the University of California, Los Angeles in the fall, majoring in computer science and minoring in Chicano studies to learn more about Mexican culture and Indigenous languages. He hopes to build a career contributing to the development of devices people use every day and plans to stay involved with United We Code to help students see themselves and their futures in computer science careers.“I would love to teach kids from my community more programming languages, like C++, which can be applied to real-world jobs,” Acuna said. “I want to expose people to programming languages that I didn’t have the opportunity to learn at a young age, to inspire them and help increase the number of people of color in STEM.”Key findings from a recent Gallup survey confirmed that a majority of students across the U.S. are interested in computer science, but many lack access to such classes in their schools and general exposure to the tech sector. The study also highlights that students who strongly agree they have computer science role models are 10 times more likely to say they will pursue a computer science career than students who strongly disagree.

“These two students exemplify how access to computer science education helps enable the self-expression and problem-solving abilities of young people today,” said Victor Reinoso, global director of Amazon’s philanthropic education initiatives. “I’m inspired by their pursuit to broaden people’s imagination and understanding of what happens in tech and the variety of roles that exist across the industry.”Computer science is the fastest-growing profession within the STEM field. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that job opportunities for computer science workers will grow 13% between 2020 and 2030, yet only 8% of STEM graduates earn a computer science degree, and only a small percentage of those come from underserved and historically underrepresented communities. Additionally, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the median annual wage for computer and information technology occupations was $91,250 in May 2020, which is more than twice the median annual wage for all occupations.Amazon Future Engineer aims to bridge the divide between interested students and access to computer science courses and opportunities. In addition to its scholarship and internship program, Amazon Future Engineer gives elementary, middle, and high school students from diverse communities around the globe access to computer science education where they can explore project-based learning initiatives, using code to make music, program robots, and solve problems.Congratulations to the Amazon Future Engineer Scholarship Class of 2022.

Learn more about how Amazon is reducing carbon emissions and creating a more sustainable shopping experience for customers.

This Earth Month, we’re highlighting the progress we’ve made as we continue to look ahead—because we know it’s just the beginning. We also want to make it easier for customers to buy products and make choices that are more sustainable. Discover more-sustainable productsClimate Pledge Friendly In 2020, Amazon launched Climate Pledge Friendly (CPF) to help customers discover and shop for more-sustainable products on Amazon, with every product having one or more of 39 certifications that help protect the natural world. Over 300,000 products and more than 20,000 brands are now available through CPF across beauty, wellness, apparel, electronics, household, and grocery. Customers can tune into Amazon Live on April 21 from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. EDT and on April 22 from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. EDT to see celebrities and influencers share their favorite CPF products.

With Amazon’s Trade-In program, the devices are either restored and re-sold or recycled through an Amazon-certified recycler, ensuring a more sustainable way to dispose of devices.Learn more about recycling Through Amazon Second Chance, customers can learn how to recycle all types of Amazon packaging in their local communities. For example, did you know Amazon's paper padded mailer offers the same recyclability as our corrugated boxes? Amazon has also invested $10 million in the Closed Loop Infrastructure Fund. Since its launch in 2018, the Fund has improved recycling access for 4.2 million households, kept 2.6 million tons of recyclable material in circulation, and avoided 5.7 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, Amazon is working to address plastic pollution, joining a consortium under the U.S. Department of Energy to spur innovation and advance new technologies.


































Amazon teams are working hard every day to invent, create, and collaborate with each other and business partners to help the company become more sustainable. Taking action, together—The Climate PledgeAmazon and more than 300 other companies are now committed to reaching net-zero carbon by 2040. Since 2019, The Climate Pledge—which was co-founded by Amazon and Global Optimism—has grown to include hundreds of companies like Microsoft, PepsiCo, and Visa that have all committed to work together and take bold steps to decarbonize and fight climate change.







Building coalitions to accelerate our decarbonization effortsIn 2020, Amazon helped to launch a series of initiatives that will help us and other companies make progress to reach net-zero carbon by 2040. We co-founded the Cargo Owners for Zero Emission Vessels network alongside the Aspen Institute, which aims to transition ocean freight vessels from fossil fuels to zero-carbon fuels by 2040. We also participated in the launch of The First Movers Coalition, which targets emission reductions in aviation, ocean shipping, steel, and trucking. Finally, we led the creation of the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance Aviators Group, which is focused on accelerating the transition to net-zero emissions air transport.







Investing in others—The Climate Pledge Fund In 2020, Amazon launched The Climate Pledge Fund with an initial $2 billion in funding to help support visionary companies whose products and services will help businesses reach net-zero carbon to fight against climate change. So far, Amazon has invested in 13 innovative companies that include Amogy, a New York-based technology startup developing an ammonia-to-power system that is emission-free at the point of use. The system may eventually be used to power heavy-duty transportation, such as cargo shipping. Another company supported by the fund is ION Energy, an India-based startup that develops software to improve the life and performance of lithium-ion batteries that power electric vehicles and energy storage systems.







Electrifying our fleetAmazon is committed to electrifying its delivery fleet. Amazon ordered 100,000 custom electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, marking the largest order ever of electric delivery vehicles, with all 100,000 vehicles planned to be on the road by 2030. Plus, Amazon has put over 15 different models of electric vehicles on the road, including custom delivery vehicles, e-cargo bikes, and e-rickshaws, to test and learn across the U.S., the European Union, and India.







Powering operations with renewable energyAmazon is on a path to powering its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of the initial 2030 target. In 2020, Amazon became the first consumer electronics company to commit to addressing the electricity used by Amazon-branded devices through renewable energy development, starting with Echo devices. We are making investments in additional wind and solar farm capacity that, by 2025, will produce the clean energy equivalent to the use of all Echo, Fire TV, and Ring devices worldwide.







Smart packagingAmazon uses machine learning algorithms to arrive at the best possible packaging choices for deliveries. That means identifying which products don’t need additional packaging and which smaller products are suitable for flexible packaging, such as padded mailers and bags that are up to 75% lighter than similar-sized boxes. As a result, Amazon has reduced the weight of outbound packaging per shipment by 36% and eliminated over 1 million tons of packaging material since 2015.







Making our buildings more sustainableAmazon Fresh announced that its newest Seattle store is the world’s first grocery store pursuing Zero Carbon certification from the International Living Future Institute. Through more than a dozen design upgrades and features, the store is expected to save nearly 185 tons of CO2 each year when compared to an industry-standard grocery store. Additionally, Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle is slated to become the first arena in the world certified as net-zero carbon, and Amazon’s buildings across its headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, will be powered by 100% renewable energy. The HQ buildings are also designed to achieve LEEDv4 Platinum certification, the highest green building certification from the U.S. Green Building Council.

Learn how a veterinarian uses Alexa to care for animals, including her own pet cat.

As a veterinarian and a pet owner, Kristen knows that pets are a big part of many people’s lives and cherished members of the household. That’s why she uses Alexa to help animals stay calm when they visit her clinic. She also uses Alexa to help run her business—including during a recent surgery.







In Kristen’s words:I’m a vet, and I only recently opened my practice. When I did, Alexa became central to the way I set it up.It really started with little things—going to the vet can be stressful, especially for cats, and as a vet it’s my job to keep them as calm as possible. The regular noise of a clinic—people coming in and out, people talking, other animals—that can all be really overwhelming, and I’ve found that my patients respond really well to white noise. I use Echo Dots in my clinic and ask Alexa to play white noise, so I can keep my patients calm without taking my attention away from them.










‘I was so grateful to have Alexa within earshot’

Learn how Alexa helped this customer call for help.

The other thing I use Alexa for in my clinic deals with some of the day-to-day realities of owning a small business. In a vet clinic, there are always supplies that need to be bought—bandages, trash bags, cleaning supplies. With Alexa, I manage my shopping lists for the clinic and order via Amazon from the Echo devices around the clinic.Quite recently I was reminded just how important Alexa was to me—I was performing surgery on my own cat, Parka. Anyone with pets would know just how precious he is to me, and when I was doing surgery, I suddenly realized I needed more information from my husband, Henri, about Parka. With cats, it’s important to minimize the time they spend under anesthesia, so I didn’t want to waste any time. I called out to Alexa during Parka’s surgery and dropped in on Henri, who was in his office at home.







Henri was able to answer all of my questions straight away, and I was able to move ahead with the surgery without stepping out of the operating suite or pausing the surgery once. Thanks to Alexa, Parka was out of surgery and back on the mend in no time.







We’re glad to hear Parka is on the road to recovery! If you have a story of your own about how you use Alexa, we'd love to hear it, and we will continue sharing some of our favorite #AlexaStories. Email us or tag us on Twitter or Instagram @alexa99 or #AlexaStories. Learn more about how Alexa is helping people in different ways by watching our Alexa Stories videos.

AWS supports grassroots organization SUCHO to replicate and securely store Ukraine’s digital content focused on culture and history. 

Volunteer librarians, archivists, researchers, and developers are working together around the world to support Ukraine by preserving its digital history. Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online (SUCHO) was founded days after the conflict began, with a mission to identify and archive irreplaceable data and content from Ukrainian cultural heritage websites. To help accelerate the work, Amazon Web Services (AWS) joined the effort.Realizing that most cultural websites were hosted in physical locations in Ukraine that could come under attack, co-organizers Sebastian Majstorovic from the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage, Quinn Dombrowski from Stanford University, and Anna Kijas from Tufts University devised a way to quickly capture and archive these important digital assets. They formed the nonprofit SUCHO collective and rapidly enlisted and trained more than a thousand global volunteers. The team began using the open-source web archiving tool Webrecorder to replicate the website data of thousands of Ukrainian museums, libraries, digitized collections, and exhibits. In their work, the SUCHO team has saved important cultural assets such as scanned historical documents, audio recordings, scientific articles, and digitized artworks.

As a grassroots project, SUCHO initially operated on a network of their volunteers’ personal computers. AWS worked with SUCHO and Webrecorder to use services like Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) and AWS Fargate to scale up the web archiving process in the AWS Cloud. So far, the project has archived more than 25 terabytes of data from over 3,000 websites, with many of the websites going offline shortly after SUCHO was able to back them up.“Due to AWS’s support, we were able to quickly scale up and enable our volunteers to capture and preserve many important digital artifacts, saving thousands of cultural heritage sites from extinction,” said Majstorovic. “Technology can empower volunteers in crisis relief efforts. Preserving historical data from sites like the National Chernobyl Museum and the State Archive of Kharkiv is just one example. We sincerely hope that most of the backups we produce will never be needed, but we are going to continue to archive as much digitized Ukrainian heritage as we can, just in case.”Starting today, the growing SUCHO web archive is available by the AWS Open Data Sponsorship Program, which covers the cost of storage for publicly available, high-value, cloud-optimized datasets. Details on accessing the archive can be found at the Registry of Open Data on AWS.AWS recently committed $15 million in cloud computing credits, and technical expertise, to help organizations like SUCHO. We will continue to support local and global nonprofit, government, and commercial customers who request assistance to address this humanitarian crisis.Learn more about what Amazon is doing to support people in Ukraine.

Amazon customers can now use their voice to plant trees around the world.

In celebration of Earth Month, Amazon is teaming up with One Tree Planted, an environmental charity that supports reforestation around the world. Customers in the U.S. with an Alexa-enabled device can now say “Alexa, grow a tree” to donate $1 to plant one tree through One Tree Planted.Trees play a vital role in creating clean air and water, maintaining a healthy climate, and providing habitats for wildlife. That’s why we are making it simple for Alexa customers to help support reforestation efforts by donating a tree just by using their voice. Customers can also keep track and view how many trees they help to plant through their Amazon Pay account.

Community partners in Paibona, Uganda plant their land and reforest the area.







To further show our commitment to helping preserve the planet, Amazon is also donating $1 million to One Tree Planted. The donation will help the nonprofit plant a total of 1 million trees, starting in April through December 2022, to make a global impact around the world. The initial reforestation projects include:Surface mine restoration in Appalachia: This project helps support the reforestation of approximately 34 acres of surface mined land in Centre County, Pennsylvania, which is unable to naturally regenerate on its own.Forest fire restoration in California: The Forest Health Project is a restoration program implemented on privately owned lands with the Mendocino National Forest impacted by the 2018 forest fires in Northern California’s Colusa County. With these funds, hard-working foresters will dedicate time to promote improved vegetation planning and resource management, helping to reduce the risk of catastrophic fires and floods in the region.Fruit trees to fight hunger in India: This project will plant and nurture fruit trees with smallholder farmers in marginalized communities across the states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Odisha, and West Bengal in India. These fruit trees will help participating farmers create sustainable livelihoods and provide nutritious food to their families and communities.Orca whale protection in the Pacific Northwest: The endangered Southern Resident Orcas have lived for millennia in a stretch of Pacific Ocean from Northern California to British Columbia. Planting trees along rivers and streams of the Pacific Northwest restores critical habitat for salmon, the primary food source of the endangered whales.Learn more about the impact of these projects.

Collaboration between AWS and the Confederated Tribes of Umatilla Indian Reservation will offer interactive learning in science, technology, engineering, math, the arts, and tribal community first foods.

An educational lab focusing on the connections between scientific topics and cultural traditions aims to encourage a new generation of environmental leaders in Oregon.Developed by the Confederated Tribes of Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR) with support from Amazon Web Services (AWS), the new lab will focus on how to prepare, protect, and preserve the cultural continuity of “first foods”—traditional foods eaten by native communities that have provided sustenance and promoted health for generations. Scientists, botanists, hydrologists, linguists, singers, gatherers, fisherman, and hunters will be among the experts delivering a range of hands-on after-school classes designed to help students explore cultural science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

“This is a unique opportunity for our students, families, and tribal descendants to extend their learning and examine how they connect to our teachings, history, land, and food traditions,” said Kat Brigham, chair of the CTUIR Board of Trustees. “We hope this approach empowers a new generation of students to think creatively about complex problems that impact our communities.” Everything in the lab, which features a range of AWS technologies and a series of images celebrating first foods, is designed to support interactive learning—including technical cloud computing training. Although primarily aimed at young people, the lab is open to the community, providing opportunities for everyone to experiment, fail fast, and think big to solve real-world problems.The CTUIR space is the second Think Big Space in Oregon, following the 2021 launch of a lab at the Port of Morrow’s Sustainable Agriculture and Energy Center, a community center with links to local schools.







The new space is also one of several initiatives between AWS and the CTUIR. Another is the creation of the first online version of the Umatilla Language dictionary as a way to preserve the Sahaptian language, spoken by Indigenous communities in the Columbia Plateau region of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. This digital dictionary, previously only available in book and CD format, is widely used by students and community members.

Amazon attorneys are leading a pro bono humanitarian initiative to develop free legal guidebooks for refugees seeking resettlement in Europe.

More than 4 million people have fled Ukraine since the start of the conflict in the country, according to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In response to the humanitarian crisis, more than 150 lawyers at Amazon and its pro bono partners have teamed up from the U.S., Europe, Mexico, India, and Australia to provide free legal assistance to organizations that are helping Ukrainian refugees.The Amazon legal team has partnered with global law firm DLA Piper and PILnet, an international pro bono clearinghouse, to develop comprehensive guidebooks about resettling in 18 European countries. The guidebooks answer legal and administrative questions for refugees, such as how to apply for work permits and where to find housing, mental health support, and childcare services.The information is being shared with a wide variety of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) based in Europe that are providing on-the-ground assistance to Ukrainian families. The organizations include the European Union Agency for Asylum, United for Ukraine, and the European Young Bar Association.“When the Ukraine conflict erupted, we immediately reached out to our pro bono partners to identify Ukrainian refugees’ most urgent legal needs,” said Najib Saïl, senior legal counsel at Amazon France and head of the European Pro Bono Taskforce.“Millions of Ukrainians have been forced to leave their country, and when trying to start a new life—either temporarily or permanently—they have a lot of questions about their rights and what kind of assistance they can access. We can use our expertise and network of law firms to help them,” Saïl said. “At Amazon, pro bono work is a mechanism to serve communities and NGOs in efficient and scalable ways, and we work to meet people’s needs and provide them with access to tools and resources about their rights.”Amazon's pro bono program encourages and enables Amazon legal professionals worldwide to provide free legal services to underserved communities. Since 2014, Amazon legal teams have donated tens of thousands of hours of pro bono legal services to clients in need. Amazon partners with a variety of community organizations and law firms globally.Find out about the free legal guidebooks and program, and learn more about what Amazon is doing to support people in Ukraine.

Meet Swati Singhal, a software engineer working on robotic operations in fulfillment centers, and one of the roboticists we're spotlighting during National Robotics Week.

Figuring out the best way to lay out an Amazon fulfillment center is no easy feat. With robots roaming the floor, software engineers like Swati Singhal work to avoid congestion and ensure coordination among the robots.







“We build full-scale 3D simulations that allow us to prototype new fulfillment centers,” said Singhal. “These simulations allow us to loop in the software responsible for deciding the motion of the robots. That way, we can identify bottlenecks, so by the time the new fulfillment center opens, it works efficiently, without unexpected problems with the flow of robotic operations.”A graduate of NSUT, Delhi in India, Singhal moved to the U.S. to earn a master’s degree in computer science from Northeastern University in Boston. Despite being nervous about the transition, she credits her U.S. education in helping her in her career at Amazon.“I was surprised how hands-on my experience at Northeastern University was. We were developing projects with people in multiple groups, but I think that helped with our soft skills as much as our technical skills,” said Singhal.Singhal now collaborates with large teams that include systems and solutions architects, as well as hardware and software engineers. Her job is to build the model and write the code for the simulation—and she led a key project to improve the process.







“Doing these kinds of simulations used to be very inefficient. It would take a long time to manage, and there were a lot of opportunities for failure,” said Singhal. “Our team was able to make it easier to launch a large number of simulations—hundreds, in fact—all at the same time. And we made it so they could be managed automatically, with the results being easily downloadable. It’s made a huge difference.”Now, more than six years into her career at Amazon, Singhal continues to feel inspired by the company culture.“The Leadership Principles are very important. They aren’t just words on a page—people really live them,” said Singhal. “In particular, I like how employees are encouraged to take ownership of a project from design to completion. No one ever says, ‘That’s not my job,’ because that’s not in the spirit of how things are done here.”Singhal also enjoys the Amazon Leadership Principle to Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit. The courage to challenge and ask questions was something that she developed early in her career, and she encourages those entering the fields of computer science and robotics to do the same.“It sounds like a cliché, but I’d tell anyone not to be afraid to ask questions—even if they seem silly,” said Singhal. “So often in life, we hold ourselves back and resolve to search for the answer online, but any question can be valid. Sometimes, asking can open a valuable discussion or highlight the gaps in a team’s knowledge.”










New Amazon program offers free career training in robotics


Upskilling program provides training in mechatronics and robotics—for careers in robotics—with hourly wages up to nearly 40% higher for employees upon completion.

Singhal has been intrigued by science and engineering since she was a young girl, and by age 11, she was enjoying coding and writing small computer programs to display shapes. She wants budding software engineers and roboticists to be unafraid to try things out and practice—and she’s excited for the future of the field they’re coming to work in, including the work that she does at Amazon.“Everything is becoming faster and better. It really is exciting to be involved in this kind of innovation, and to be part of the design of the solution,” said Singhal.Meet the other Amazon roboticists being spotlighted in our National Robotics Week series and explore jobs working with Amazon robotics.

Meet Heidi Schubert, who creates drone traffic management software for Prime Air, and is one of the roboticists we're spotlighting during National Robotics Week.

Senior software engineer Heidi Schubert admits that she doesn’t need to motivate her team.“All I have to do is explain what we’re trying to do. Often, it’s something that’s never been done before. It’s a fun job. We’re building something very exciting,” she said.







Schubert works on Prime Air, where she’s responsible for creating drone traffic management software. The work brings together her background in aerospace robotics and her interest in autonomous systems.“The Prime Air drones are autonomous. To fly safely, they need some ground station support,” said Schubert. “What we do is essentially build a map of the area and use it to plan a detailed route that helps the drone get to its destination safely.”Before working on Prime Air drones, Schubert earned her doctorate degree in aeronautical and astronautical engineering at Stanford University and spent years focusing on other Amazon devices, including Amazon Astro—an autonomous robot that relies on the sophisticated software her team built to help it move around a customer’s home while sensing and avoiding obstacles.

“Autonomy is a burgeoning space, with a lot of people trying to solve the same problems. For us, this is about using robot motion to provide value to customers and communities. That’s what’s great about working at Amazon on Prime Air; it’s a terrific project both in terms of technical innovation and customer value,” said Schubert.That value extends beyond the customer to the planet, as Schubert points out, because Prime Air drones are battery powered.“Amazon is a special place because our work with autonomy is going to help build better customer experiences,” said Schubert. “These are tough problems to solve, but we are figuring it out. We don’t just go away and do research—we combine research with development to reach a goal.”

Growing up in a small town in Oregon, Schubert never imagined that she’d end up developing autonomous air traffic controls for delivery drones, but she has good advice for anyone interested in robotics.“Robotics is multidisciplinary,” she said. “Think about what you’re interested in—electrical engineering or hardware or something else—and combine it with software. Software is important to everything we work on in robotics.”Schubert is clear that it’s also important to have diverse interests.“If you want to join a robotics team in your neighborhood, that’s great. It’s also okay to play an instrument or have other interests,” said Schubert. “As the numbers and types of robots in our lives increase, it’s critical that we have people thinking about how they interact with us, and that requires a totally different skill set to what you might imagine for a roboticist.”As someone who graduated at a time when robotics jobs were scarce, Schubert is optimistic about the future of her rapidly growing industry.Meet the other Amazon roboticists being spotlighted in our National Robotics Week series and explore jobs working with Prime Air.

Meet Jon Stevens, a principal engineer working on Scout, and one of the roboticists we're spotlighting during National Robotics Week.

Jon Stevens is clear about what motivates his work with Amazon Scout.“I remember as a child getting a kid’s guide to robotics from the library. It taught me how to make a robotic finger out of a couple of straws and some string. Even though it was pretty basic, I was amazed at being able to create something that had movement and life to it—that was a reflection of us as creatures,” said Stevens.







Stevens went on to study kinematics and dynamics in college, which is where his curiosity evolved into the beginnings of a career.On graduation, he landed a job at Segway, where he started by working on vehicle dynamics. While working in his role, he also managed to learn about embedded programming, software, analog electronics, motors, and batteries. Everything that makes an electrically propelled vehicle. When Stevens was working on the balancing and steering controllers of Segway, he recognized what would become a key interest for him.“I realized that it was about an interface and the ability of people to interact with machines. That’s where I found my passion,” said Stevens. “Not just in building robots or robotic systems, but things you could interact with dynamically. It became a major theme in what I like to do. I have spent a lot of time thinking about how people interact with devices.”




                “There’s a great synthesis between art and technology. They’re both highly creative.”
            

Jon Stevens
Principal engineer




As part of the Scout team, Stevens’s instinct to build robots that enhance the human experience has never left him.“Technology should be delightful. We want people to welcome Scout into the community and for it to be everything it could be. That means that it needs to be a good pedestrian and yield and be courteous, and my work on locomotion contributes to that.”The concept of robotics improving and augmenting our lives is a big part of Stevens’s philosophy that good robots should give people better tools to work with. Tools that build our own strengths, in the same way computers strengthen analysis and calculation.







Earlier in his career, Stevens developed electric bikes with the idea of technology complementing humanity.“At Superpedestrian, we wanted to use robotics to augment the rider experience. Our theory was that you shouldn’t feel like a human riding an e-bike; you should feel like a superhuman riding a bike. That’s what we wanted the experience to be,” he said.With this kind of enthusiasm and ambition for the potential of robotic technology, Stevens also found himself among the Imagineers at Walt Disney for some years. Working with the ride systems group, he pursued his love of enhancing things that move—this time for the enjoyment of thrill-seekers.Stevens worked with creatives at Disney who wanted each attraction to tell a story. He also worked with ride animators who translated the stories into motion, and hardware engineers who built vehicles with the capabilities to express what the creatives wanted. He admits that he’s had a particularly fun set of experiences as a person in technology.“On one project, we wanted to do some experiments on how to mimic the feeling of being in a car chase, because you have to understand how that feels,” said Stevens. “I got sent out into the desert north of Los Angeles to learn how to drift in a real car with experts. We also gathered data, so we could translate those experiences into the ride vehicles we were developing. We did experiments on vehicle capability and how they felt in reality.”










What's next for Amazon Scout?

Thousands of smiles into its journey, Amazon Scout rolls further into the future.

In his current role working on Scout, Stevens enjoys combining this passion for experimentation with real-world problem-solving. In fact, he was initially drawn to the opportunity to solve the “last mile problem” with a lightweight electric propulsion vehicle. He also wanted to learn about Amazon’s Leadership Principles from within and see firsthand how they are being used effectively in a big company.“I came here to work on robotics and to work with the great people we have at Amazon,” said Stevens. “In robotics, you don’t do anything alone. It takes a team with diverse skills and perspectives, shared passions, and a bit of courage to tackle the unknown.”When it comes to advice for budding roboticists, Stevens says to keep your eyes open, be curious, and take risks.“I don’t think I planned to work anywhere I’ve worked,” he said. “I was drawn along by my interests, what I wanted to learn, and who I wanted to be with. When you align your passions and your interests with what you’re doing, the hard work becomes meaningful.”A creative who enjoys art and music outside of work, Stevens also stresses that robotics isn’t all about the application of rules. It’s more creative than people think.“There’s a great synthesis between art and technology. They’re both highly creative,” said Stevens. “Robotics isn’t all science and engineering. It spans multiple domains. As robots get more exposure among the public, disciplines like industrial design and experience design will become even more core to the process of bringing robots to life.”Meet the other Amazon roboticists being spotlighted in our National Robotics Week series and explore jobs working with Amazon Scout.

Meet Lisa Huang, a senior embedded software engineer working on Scout, and one of the roboticists we're spotlighting during National Robotics Week.

Senior Embedded Software Engineer Lisa Huang, now based in the UK, began her Amazon career working on processors for Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers. After focusing her work on networks for more than a decade, five years ago, Huang began to crave a new challenge.







Principal engineers at the company pointed out that one benefit of being at Amazon is that you can move around. They encouraged Huang to talk to different teams. “I’d never thought about that,” said Huang. “I felt really fortunate that I had these people pushing and inspiring me.”Scout was only the second team Huang spoke with, and while she’d never worked on robotics before, she learned they had a need for her operating systems (OS) skills. Huang’s OS knowledge was fundamental to Scout’s hardware—and with that job change, she got her start in robotics.

At the time, fall 2017, Scout was in the early stages of development.“In the early days, we were still trying to prove the concept. In 2019, after a couple years of development and many simulations, Scout delivered its first package. I remember the team feeling so proud when the device unhesitatingly paused to avoid a curious cat that had followed it down the street and then darted in front of its path,” said Huang.In many ways, Huang’s Scout work fits perfectly with her desire to work closely with hardware as a software engineer. When she was a high school student in Delaware, she enjoyed figuring out how things worked. This initially led her to consider both mechanical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.




                “A job like this is great for people who are naturally curious and like breaking problems down and solving them piece by piece.”
            

Lisa Huang
Senior embedded software engineer




By the end of her first year in college, she figured out that her future would be more on the software side.“Second semester physics just didn’t click for me. I didn’t find it intuitive enough to follow a mechanical engineering path,” said Huang. “At the same time, I really got into computer engineering and developing software, but I hadn’t done any programming until I went to university, which is different from a lot of my colleagues who started writing programs when they were in high school—and sometimes before.”







Huang’s work in embedded software and operating systems for Scout now combines her two original interests, and she gets to work on broad multidisciplinary teams.“There’s obviously the hardware, the mechanics, and the electrical components. The software—where I work—is a foundational component, and then there’s the artificial intelligence and the behavioral aspects of it. With software, we’re writing a smaller version of what our human brains do,” said Huang.Amazon wasn’t initially on Huang’s radar when she graduated. She took a job at Cisco Systems and stayed there for 10 years, working in several areas, including device drivers and network protocols for the company’s customer processors. When she was ready for a move, she considered different options.“I was thinking about where to go next, but Amazon wasn’t really on the list,” she said. “I thought of Amazon as a web services company, not a place where I’d get to work with hardware.”However, a good friend disagreed and thought Huang was perfect for a new role on the AWS networks team. After seeing her resume, the project lead was impressed with her experience.“I got an email and then a call saying, ‘I think you’d be a great fit.’ I thought I’d be foolish not to have a conversation, so I went through the interview process and got an offer,” said Huang.

Now several years into her robotics work, Huang has been building a Scout team in Cambridge, UK. She’s delighted she took the plunge. Her advice for anyone interested in working in the field is that they should “give it a go.”“Try things out,” said Huang. “Start in one domain of robotics and move around. Figure out what you like. A job like this is great for people who are naturally curious and like breaking problems down and solving them piece by piece.”Meet the other Amazon roboticists being spotlighted in our National Robotics Week series and explore jobs working with Amazon Scout.

Meet Kobe Boateng, who works across Amazon’s suite of fulfillment center robots, and is one of the roboticists we're spotlighting during National Robotics Week.

Having spent many years enjoying warm climates—moving from his home in Ghana to Florida, and then spending time in Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, and Nigeria–Kobe Boateng is pleased to have experienced and enjoyed his first winter in Massachusetts.







“I came to Boston for a Harvard-Africa business conference and told myself, ‘I’m never ever coming here again.’ And guess what? Six months later, I was offered an opportunity that was so exciting that I moved my family to Boston from Atlanta. Now, I have pictures of my kids playing in the snow. It’s been a fantastic experience.”Boateng’s circuitous route to the Boston area—one of the robotics centers of the United States—led him to a critical role as a senior manager involved with control systems design and safety across Amazon’s suite of fulfillment center robots.“We’re just scratching the surface of how robotics can impact humanity. Whether that’s eliminating activities that result in repetitive stress injuries or workflow, medical, or automation processes—the diversity of application is exciting. My responsibility is to ensure that robotic systems are designed in a way that respects human dignity.”










New technologies to improve Amazon employee safety

From testing new workstations to innovating on high-tech autonomous vehicles, Amazon’s Robotics and Advanced Technology teams focus on making work safer for employees.

In his current role, Boateng leads product safety and regulatory compliance teams, but his robotics journey began in a different industry.“My first job was in the energy sector. I was interested in working in high tech, but at the time, there was a hiring freeze. At a career fair, I decided to practice my interview skills with the recruiter, and ended up being offered a job on the spot.”The opportunity gave Boateng his first exposure to process control instrumentation, working at a large facility in New Orleans. In response to Hurricane Katrina, Boateng played a role in the plant recovery team. Boateng then shifted to actively developing and evaluating new technology—as well as producing the standards and guidelines to make the tech safe. In this new phase of his career, he gained critical experience in high-risk facilities in countries including Angola and Nigeria.




                “Learning, being curious, and exploring has been an integral part of my journey.”

Senior manager, controls system and safety




His work created a strong foundation for his role at Amazon, which he views as a way to transfer his skills into the world of robotics. He understands the importance of his work as he and his teams evaluate the breadth of technologies that are often synthesized into a single robotic solution.“We’re not just tinkering over here,” said Boateng. “We’re solving problems in a company that is customer obsessed. We’re always learning, and we’re always pushing the boundaries.”Boateng also takes pride in being able to build a team that has a high regard for the safety of people and is integral to the design of safe systems across Amazon.“From the functional safety of the autonomous mobile robots to ensuring that any modifications to existing robots don’t impact their safety integrity to the control systems for Robin, the manipulator arm—we do it all. Anything that has any intelligence or electronics, my team supports it,” said Boateng.






Robin, one of the most complex stationary robot arm systems Amazon has ever built.

As a science enthusiast who excelled in math, physics, and chemistry at a young age, Boateng said the Amazon experience is rare, offering a unique immersion into the world of robotics.“We don’t just design—we also manufacture, and we deploy. So, you get to see the entire life cycle, and you’re able to learn from how customers interact with the robots. That’s incredibly valuable,” he said.Boateng initially travelled to the U.S. to study engineering at Florida A&M when the lecturers in Ghana went on strike. He’s now passionate about other Africans and Americans participating in cultural and educational exchanges. To that end, he is the founder of a program, African Diaspora Nation, that gives African students access to African and American universities and vice versa.The initiative encourages curiosity and open-mindedness among the next generation—in particular, underrepresented youth. Boateng believes in the benefits of learning through new experiences.“Learning, being curious, and exploring has been an integral part of my journey. The program I support has proven to be a powerful and transformational experience for many young people,” said Boateng. “I had the opportunity to take some students from the United States to my home country of Ghana, and it was a life-changing experience for them. They came back energized, with a different perspective of the world. Now, I’m at Amazon. I’m keen to introduce a science, technology, engineering, and math component to encourage the next generation of technologists.”Meet the other Amazon roboticists being spotlighted in our National Robotics Week series and explore jobs working with Amazon robotics.

Drug discovery using computational analysis generates two new chemical compounds that could help stop the spread of the coronavirus. 

Researchers in France used high performance computing (HPC) from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to isolate two chemical compounds that might slow or stop the spread of COVID-19, and potentially reduce its severity. The discoveries were made by analyzing the molecular structures of a key ""protease,"" a large molecule responsible for regulating chemical reactions in the virus. With a deeper understanding of the molecule’s unique structural characteristics, the researchers detected vulnerable areas of the protease and matched the weaknesses to two novel synthesizable compounds—in other words, new potential medicines. If you think of the protease as an impossibly large skyscraper with millions of locked doors, AWS's suite of HPC systems allowed the researchers to sort through and find the correct keys to unlock new compounds and treatments at a pace far faster than in the past.










Scientists discover nine new coronaviruses in 11 days using AWS 

Supercomputer built on Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides world’s most comprehensive open database on viruses that can potentially infect humans, to help stop pandemics before they start.

""Previously, such efforts would have taken months, if not years,"" said Robert Marino, CEO of Qubit Pharmaceuticals, which collaborated with researchers from Italy, France, Switzerland, and Enamine, a chemistry company, to conduct the analysis and synthesis of the compounds. ""Now, we are able to make these discoveries in months."" The compounds will go on to be tested in a preclinical environment, and their efficacy as a treatment or cure will be evaluated by regulators.Though the power of cloud computation is already impressive, Marino said the impact and ability of applying massive compute power to isolate new compounds and find new cures will only increase over the next five to 10 years. Much of the medical and biological research community has its eye on the development of quantum computing, a form of computational processing that uses the variable states of quantum mechanics—the forces within atoms—to store information, rather than using traditional 1s and 0s to store bits.While quantum computing is in its early days, the ambition of researchers working at Qubit and places like the AWS Center for Quantum Computing at Cal Tech is to unlock the power of quantum computing to exponentially speed up computing tasks. The speed increases researchers anticipate for certain computing tasks are mind-bending. For example, a problem that a traditional supercomputer would solve in 10,000 years could, in theory, take a quantum machine mere minutes. In other words, solving problems that are essentially impossible with classical computing becomes possible when we move to the quantum computing realm.

According to Marino, quantum computing's true value to medical research won't be as much the speed of processing as the degree of complexity a quantum computer can handle when solving problems. Biological molecules exist in mind-bogglingly intricate systems. Proteins, sugars, fats, DNA, RNA, and a host of chemical markers in between all interact, bend, change shape, split, and grow around each other. Additionally, researchers must understand the effects of temperature, pressure, salinity, and environmental variables that cause a molecule to change shape and property. Being able to map all these factors at one time and perform analysis—instantly—is where the future of medical research lies, said Marino. So far, only quantum computing suggests the power to handle that much data and computational cost.Still, the discovery of these two potential COVID-19 treatments relied on an impressive array of high-powered computing systems. The Laboratory of Theoretical Chemistry at Sorbonne University built the original map of COVID-19 in May 2020, as infections skyrocketed. They leaned on France's national supercomputing center and AWS services to perform the simulations and model the proteins that form coronaviruses.Further simulations were performed in the AWS Cloud with funding from special COVID-19 grants AWS awarded to accelerate treatments and cures for the disease. In addition, the research teams relied on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) with NVIDIA graphic processing units and EC2 On-Demand to scan through the vast chemical libraries, which indexed the potential cures; Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provided the researchers with scalable and encrypted file storage; and Tinker-HP, deployed on AWS, provided high-performance molecular dynamics software. Using these tools, the team could explore enormous data libraries and vet potential cures that might have previously been omitted due to time and cost.

COVID-19 is only one disease this HPC computing approach is targeting, Marino said. Qubit is also using its proprietary software with AWS's computing and analytics services to find potential cures for cancer and other critical diseases.

With new long-term launch commitments, Project Kuiper prepares for future satellite deployments.

Amazon continues to deliver on its roadmap for Project Kuiper, a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite system designed to provide fast, affordable broadband to unserved and underserved communities around the world. We’re excited to announce we’ve secured up to 83 launches from three commercial space companies—Arianespace, Blue Origin, and United Launch Alliance (ULA)—to provide heavy-lift capacity for the program. These agreements mean we have enough capacity to carry into space the majority of the 3,236 satellites that make up our satellite constellation.The three agreements include 38 launches on ULA’s Vulcan Centaur rocket, 18 launches on Arianespace’s Ariane 6, and 12 launches on Blue Origin’s New Glenn, with options for 15 additional launches. Together, they represent the largest commercial procurement of space launch services in history, and our investments will support thousands of suppliers and highly skilled jobs in the space industry across the United States and Europe.Preparing to delight customers around the worldAs part of Amazon’s family of products and services, Project Kuiper is working to deliver high-speed, low-latency broadband service at an affordable price. The Kuiper System includes three key elements: our advanced LEO satellites; small, affordable customer terminals; and a secure, resilient ground-based communications network.

Scalable technology to dispense satellitesLaunch is just one piece of getting our satellites safely into space. We also need a system to securely deploy satellites at the correct altitudes for insertion into orbit. We’ve completed an agreement with Switzerland-headquartered Beyond Gravity (formerly RUAG Space) to build the low-cost, versatile satellite dispensers that will deploy the Project Kuiper constellation. Beyond Gravity’s dispensers can easily scale up and down in capacity to fit the different rockets we’re using.The Project Kuiper contract is the single-largest order in Beyond Gravity’s history. The company is doubling its production capacity as a result, opening a second production facility in Linköping, Sweden, where it will create dozens of jobs.Bolstering the commercial space industryOur investments in Project Kuiper will also benefit the wider launch services industry, accelerating the pace of innovation, improving launch infrastructure, and supporting thousands of suppliers and highly skilled jobs in 49 U.S. states and 13 European countries.For instance, in addition to launch services, our contract with ULA also covers production and launch infrastructure to support more launches, timed closer together, at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. That work includes a new, dedicated version of the Vulcan Launch Platform. ULA is also making investments in their Spaceflight Processing and Operations Center to deliver a second ULA facility capable of full vehicle processing, with two parallel “launch lanes” for high-cadence operations.There are now more than 1,000 people working on the Project Kuiper program as we prepare to serve tens of millions of customers around the world.

With Yolélé, Chef Pierre Thiam is offering Amazon customers bold, fresh tastes and creating global opportunities for farmers in his homeland.

Chef Pierre Thiam remembers the enthusiastic words from his co-workers that pivoted him toward where he is now: ""Why don't you add these dishes to the menu as specials? People would love it!""Thiam wasn’t yet a restaurant owner, but he was rising fast from his first job busing tables in New York City. He had started cooking favorites from his native Senegal for ""family meal""—the staff-only dinner served before customers arrived at the restaurant where he worked. It was a revelation to his co-workers. They'd tried just about everything New York had to offer but hadn't tasted the beautiful blend of flavors, ingredients, and cooking techniques that the ugliness of colonialism had carried to his native Senegal. There, on the northwest coast of Africa, influences from France, Vietnam, and Lebanon are folded into local culinary traditions going back millennia.


































Thiam described a typical dish: ""The tomato broth has so much flavor. Before cooking the rice in it, we cook a fish stuffed with a spicy parsley mixture. Once the fish is cooked, you scoop it out, and you add vegetables: eggplants, cassava, carrots, cabbage. Then there's fruitiness from tamarind, acidity from lime, chili, fermented conch that adds so much umami. It's a dish to die for.""The great response from co-workers—and the popularity of his dishes when they appeared as specials on the restaurant menu—validated a belief Thiam had when he arrived in New York. ""When I first started in restaurants, NYC was called the food capital of the world, but Africa was the big absence,"" he said. ""I saw this as an opportunity.""Maximizing the opportunity of that absence has since defined Thiam's career as a chef and an entrepreneur. He now runs restaurants where African flavors are the star attraction, not occasional specials.






























































Thiam and his business partner, Philip Teverow, also created a food brand called Yolélé and started selling it on Amazon. They began with fonio, a grain that Thiam’s grandmother served to him when he was a boy. It was one of the ingredients he couldn't find in the U.S., and he believed it checked ""so many boxes"" that people around the world would embrace it.""Fonio is the oldest cultivated grain in Africa,"" Thiam said. ""It's very nutritious, and it cooks in five minutes. It has a nutty flavor, and it's versatile because it's neutral. It takes the flavor you add but doesn't contrast with it. Also, when you look at climate change, we have this food system that uses crops that demand so much water. Fonio is drought-resistant and has deep roots that slow the advance of the desert by restoring the topsoil.""







Amazon customers have given Yolélé's fonio an average of 4.4 stars.""The great thing with Amazon is the user feedback,"" Thiam said. ""It really tells us where our customers are and what they think about our products. That's something we use quite a lot as inspiration for our future products or how we even transform our products.""










Bringing 'Beautiful Coffee to the People' by selling in Amazon’s store 

A key pandemic pivot helped Keba and Rachel Konte revitalize their coffee business to reach new customers—and heights.

Along with its Amazon store, Yolélé is now on the shelves of thousands of retail stores across the U.S.Thiam said what's most gratifying is to be able to see the impact for farmers back in the region of Senegal where fonio grows. ""The population is mostly women because the men are gone for the most part,"" he said. ""They migrated either to the big city or are trying to migrate to Europe because there's no opportunities, they have no jobs. Our core mission at Yolélé was to change that dynamic. By opening markets, you bring economic opportunities, you bring jobs.""


































""It started with a dream, and I'm seeing this happening now,"" Thiam added. ""We used to be importers of food, and now people who are among the poorest people in the world can export this amazing grain and feed the world. I'm able to give back and, most importantly, create a model of development for other cultures, other crops in Africa. Fonio is really just the beginning. We're going to come with other crops, other ingredients that Africa has been storing in secret for way too long.""

Learn more about girls and women who are working with tech and find out how AWS customers are innovating to increase gender equality.

Every day, women make history.Women use technology both creatively and functionally to effect change. For Women’s History Month, we're showcasing Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers—from nonprofit to corporate—using tech to create institutional-level transformations that benefit girls and women.Technology elevates art: AI art exhibit by a women-led teamAn all-women team created a luminous, interactive sculpture commissioned by AWS and powered by AWS artificial intelligence (AI). The exhibit is at the Smithsonian Arts and Industries Building on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.










Take a peek ""behind the art"" with the Official AWS Podcast 

Learn about the Smithsonian's FUTURES exhibit and its centerpiece—the interactive artificial intelligence and light sculpture, me + you, by artist Suchi Reddy.




Listen now
















Titled me + you, the piece resulted from the collaborative vision of India-born architect and artist Suchi Reddy, arts curator Isolde Brielmaier, and AWS.The installation is—literally—brilliant. The sculpture consists of thin, flexible sheets of LEDs, diffusers, acrylic tubes, and paper.When visitors contribute their vision of the future by standing near the sculpture and saying the words ""My future looks…,” and filling in the rest, AI technology translates their answers into patterns of light and color.“It’s been this fantastic series of connections with amazing women who led us from the big idea to do an exhibition about the future to the very specific manifestation of me + you in our rotunda,” said Rachel Goslins, director of the Smithsonian Arts and Industries Building.“Technology allows museums to open up and become more accessible,” said Brielmaier. She added that it causes them to ""really think very, very critically about issues of diversity and equity.” 

What is the Future of Artificial Intelligence? | Amazon News







Reddy and Brielmaier’s work on the sculpture represents art innovation by women in the 21st century, as they take the discipline into new territory.Nonprofit impacts careers: Girls Who CodeThe median wage in tech is double that of the national median wage, with an estimated half-million new tech jobs emerging by 2029. Girls Who Code is one of the largest girls’ international nonprofit organizations in the world. The organization endeavors to close the gender gap in entry-level tech jobs by 2030.Girls Who Code is doing its part to prepare girls for the jobs of the future through programs like Girls Who Code clubs. The clubs are communities for students in grades 3–12, where they learn coding skills and examine portraits of women who work in tech, as role models. The nonprofit organization also has a virtual, two-week Girls Who Code Work Prep program for young women. The program includes mentorship from women working in tech.

The organization’s initiatives serve dual purposes by impacting wage and opportunity gaps for girls of color. Girls Who Code works with corporate partners to address equity issues, including credentialing and promotion practices. It also advocates that firms consider girls and women from non-traditional backgrounds who can bring value and unique perspectives and strengths to the tech industry. Girls Who Code is an AWS customer and uses AWS technology solutions.Companies create change: 8PERCENT and ADP8PERCENTThe Korean financial services firm 8PERCENT is a fintech pioneer. When it launched in 2014, it created an industry segment that didn’t yet exist in Korea.Hyojin Lee, the company’s founder and chief executive officer, also overturned conventions by making 8PERCENT a mid-interest rate, loan-based business. Her company entered an environment where high-interest rates were the norm.










Women founders: How to beat bias to get backing for your business

When it comes to raising capital for your startup, the gender gap remains painfully real. Amazon Web Services invited five women entrepreneurs to tell us how they prevailed.

The woman-founded startup has raised over $24 billion (28 trillion KRW) in loan application funds. Building its products and services on AWS, the company aims to change the future for borrowers and investors, and help grow the wealth of ordinary Koreans investing via the 8PERCENT app.ADPAutomatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP) is best known for its payroll, benefits, and human resources services, though it has also been doing work in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) through its DEI Dashboard. Built on AWS, ADP helps companies run analytics to examine their workforces using segment variables including gender, ethnicity, veteran status, and age.ADP also created Pay Equity Storyboard on AWS. The Pay Equity Storyboard provides insights, tools, and visualizations that a company can use to identify pay equity gaps between the company’s workforce and similar employers. The storyboard also provides proactive solutions to correct gaps. ADP launched the storyboard in the summer of 2021. By December 2021, over 210,000 people saw their pay increase, on average, by $3,500.According to ADP analytics that tracked employment statistics from the start of the pandemic in March 2020, job losses exacerbated the existing pay gap between men and women. ""Men actually fared a lot better than women during the pandemic,” said Jack Berkowitz, chief data officer at ADP. According to ADP, women lost 20 years of progress in terms of pay-equity gaps during the pandemic.The storyboard helps companies identify the pay-equity gaps at their firms—including gender-based gaps—and delivers insights that empower companies to proactively address disparities.“Now is the time to use data to help people understand what actions we can take to create a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive work environment and build the future we all want,” said Berkowitz.Find more examples of AWS’s commitment to DEI throughout the year on the All Builders Welcome and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Customer Stories pages.

Learn how Vornado built a smarter fan with Alexa Connect Kit, which makes building connected devices easy and cost-effective.

Alexa has become an important fixture and much-loved companion in many homes—playing your favorite songs, telling you the weather, or even controlling your smart home. With summer around the corner, Alexa is making it easy for customers to beat the heat, hands-free.Household fans play an important part in staying cool and comfortable during the hot summer months, and now customers can control their Vornado fans using their voice and Alexa. Once the fan is connected to an Alexa device, simply tell the fan to turn on and oscillate according to the speed setting of your choice. Or you can create an Alexa Routine that automatically activates the fan for you and turns it off when you leave.Unlock new experiences with Alexa Connect KitVornado’s 660AE and OSCR37 AE electric fans work with Alexa with the help of Alexa Connect Kit, a service for device manufacturers that makes it easy to integrate Alexa into their products.For Vornado, Alexa Connect Kit helped open a new chapter of possibilities for the company’s classic product lines by unlocking new customer experiences with smart technology and voice capabilities.

“We identified the significant role smart technology would play to enhance our customer’s experience nearly a decade ago, but we also knew that when we launched a solution, it had to be seamless,” said Vornado Vice President, Brian Cartwright who leads R&D and design. “We saw the opportunity to add Alexa to our products as a way to help us deliver comfort into people’s lives easily and with as much versatility as possible.”Alexa Connect Kit makes voice integration simpleVornado spent years reviewing the costs of developing smart solutions, but the company was unable to find an affordable option. The company was told it would take several years and a huge financial investment to get it right. Plus, additional investments in cloud services, new software, and security firmware would be needed to address bugs and stay up to date with changes in consumer technology.“Depending on who you talk to, you can get a wide range of costs from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. We were basically stalled and couldn’t make a case for that kind of investment,” said Vornado Director, Greg Pease who leads R&D and engineering. “It wasn’t until Amazon approached us about Alexa Connect Kit that we saw a way to remove some of these barriers to entry.”Until recently, integrating smart technologies into everyday devices was limited by several hurdles. Adding voice to a product required device makers to develop new components with Wi-Fi and processing power, in addition to software that controls their functions and connectivity.Alexa Connect Kit simplifies the process with a compact module that enables cloud connectivity and voice control. It also includes the necessary back-end services so device makers don’t have to write special networking or security firmware, set up and manage cloud services, or develop an Alexa skill or app. The Alexa service then allows customers to operate the device by relaying voice commands to Alexa-enabled devices or through the Alexa app.“Alexa Connect Kit, and the expertise and functionality that came along with it, really empowered us to strategically get where we wanted to go,” Pease said.New to building connected devices? Amazon can helpVornado’s success with Alexa Connect Kit began in October 2020, when the company started parallel development on two new products. The goal was to launch the devices at the same time in early 2021, but supply chain issues stemming from the pandemic caused significant delays.“I can say without reservation that we might have been a few more years out from launching if a solution like Alexa Connect Kit hadn’t come around,” Pease said.Paul Hegdahl, senior business development manager for Alexa Connect Kit, frequently works with product manufacturers facing similar difficulties. “Alexa Connect Kit is designed to help device makers simplify connected product development and bring products to market quickly,” he said. “With Alexa Connect Kit, we’re invested in supporting them through the whole process, from concept evaluation to post-launch product support.”

After an initial meeting with Amazon in October, Pease was impressed by the speed of the development process. Vornado had been working with manufacturing partners that did not have the experience needed to integrate Alexa Connect Kit chips with Vornado’s existing circuit boards, but Amazon was able to introduce Vornado to several alternative vendors to get the process started. “The way the team worked with us and helped us find partners to bring these products to life has just been absolutely phenomenal. It makes it so easy for us,” Pease said.From there, Amazon coordinated the product development work with the manufacturing partner that was integrating the hardware, which allowed Vornado to take on more of a project management and quality assurance role. Within months, Vornado was ready to launch the 660AE—the company’s first voice-controlled product—by July 2021. The Alexa Connect Kit-enabled oscillating tower fan, the OSCR37 AE, followed just two weeks later.Vornado was also thrilled to announce its products carried both Works with Alexa and Certified for Humans certifications. “It provides that extra layer of credibility for customers,” said Cartwright. “It was a nice bonus on top of the other support we received from Amazon’s business development and marketing team to promote our products.”Recent sales of Vornado’s new Alexa-enabled products have been “outstanding,” added Cartwright, and Vornado is excited about continuing to build great customer experiences. “Alexa Connect Kit gave us the level of expertise we needed to be successful and allowed us to focus on doing what we do best—it was a no brainer,” Pease said.

Amazon supports its transportation partners with fuel programs and benefits so they can focus on delivering for customers.

The small businesses, drivers, and other partners that make up Amazon’s transportation and delivery networks are a critical component of our operations. We are dedicated to supporting them so they can continue to grow their businesses while getting packages to our customers. There’s been a lot of news about rising fuel costs across the country and the impact of those costs on transportation and delivery companies. We want to share more about how Amazon’s existing fuel programs support our partners year-round, regardless of pricing fluctuations at the pump.Each year, we spend hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel cards and benefits for Amazon’s line haul and delivery partners:Amazon Freight Partners, which are small business trucking companies that provide dedicated capacity to service Amazon’s network needs, have all fuel costs covered under their existing partnership with Amazon.Small business freight carriers that use Relay (our service for freight carriers to book and haul available Amazon loads utilizing their free capacity) have a fuel surcharge covered by Amazon, which is based on weekly national averages published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration for every mile that carriers drive. These freight carriers are also eligible to enroll in Amazon’s fuel discount program, which provides access to pre-negotiated fuel discounts at leading diesel merchants and thousands of independent locations across North America.Delivery Service Partners have all fuel costs covered under their existing partnership with Amazon.Amazon Flex delivery partners earn over $26 per hour on average in the U.S., and we’ve made several adjustments through pricing surges in impacted areas. In addition, we are launching a program to double the cashback on fuel purchases to up to 12% with the Amazon Flex Rewards Debit Card.We are continuing to closely monitor this situation to determine if we need to make future adjustments to support our transportation partners. We are so proud of the work our partners do every day, and we thank them for all they do to empower their teams and deliver for customers and their communities.

Amazon’s merger and acquisition transactions mark some of the most exciting moments in the company’s history. Get to know Susan Jong, leader of the legal team that guides these historic deals.

Whole Foods Market, PillPack, Ring, Zoox, and the recent acquisition of MGM—they’re some of the highest-profile merger and acquisition (M&A) deals in Amazon’s history. Each brings the promise of exciting innovations that could positively impact millions of customers, and all five of these transactions—as well as many other needle-moving acquisitions by the company—were led by the lawyers on Susan Jong’s team.“M&A work is very much a team effort,” said Jong, associate general counsel and leader of Amazon’s M&A legal team. “Everyone on our team has unique strengths and looks at things a bit differently, and that’s contributed to our success with the complex transactions we handle.”Jong has worked with Amazon for more than 10 years, and while that means she’s run point on many exciting deals, an equally important part of her work has been supporting the growth of the attorneys she manages.“The female leadership was actually one of the reasons the role was very appealing to me,” said Gina Jung, senior corporate counsel on Jong’s team. “I've been doing M&A for a long time now, but before I came to Amazon, I didn’t have much experience with tech M&A or with managing other attorneys. Susan and others on the team helped me build those skills, and that focus on training has helped me become a more effective lawyer and grow in a leadership role.”

Jong’s focus on the continued growth of each member of her team has showed up in the positive impact they’ve made at Amazon and the companies it works with.“Susan and her team of lawyers leading deals are some of the most talented in the field,” said Peter Krawiec, senior vice president of Business & Corporate Development at Amazon. “Under Susan’s leadership, they have a long history of working hand-in-hand with Corporate Development to unlock value for mission-driven entrepreneurs who innovate on behalf of customers.”We spoke with Jong about her work and what makes her team unique. Keep reading to learn more about the leader of the legal team behind some of the biggest moments in Amazon’s M&A history.What is your favorite part of working as an M&A lawyer?The job is never boring. Every transaction is different, with different issues and personalities, and that makes the work exciting. I’ve also had the opportunity to work with amazing people at Amazon—colleagues, clients, and mentors—who are extremely smart, hard-working, and dedicated to innovating for customers. It’s the combination of those two things that has kept me doing this work at Amazon for 10 years. If you do work that excites you with people you enjoy working with, it makes all the difference.What has been the most exciting moment of your career?I would take it back to when I was flying to Austin, Texas for the announcement of the Whole Foods Market deal. This was the biggest transaction we had done, and in a very compressed period of time, and I was so proud of our team. The best part was, I was on a plane with spotty Wi-Fi and nowhere else to be, so I actually took the time to let it sink in and reflect on all that it took to get there.

What makes a good M&A deal lead?The best lawyers are creative problem-solvers for their clients. We’re trying to use all the tools we have at our disposal to get an outcome that we and the other party are happy with. This is where diverse perspectives are invaluable.There was a recent study that showed there are few women lawyers leading M&A deals. What are your thoughts on the research?I read the study by professor Afra Afsharipour at UC Davis, and it certainly was disappointing to learn that few women have led the largest M&A deals over the last decade. Women now represent over 50% of students at law schools, and law firms are getting better in terms of diversity in the partnership ranks, but there still appears to be a lack of female leadership in this particular area of law. My team has followed a different trend, with women running point on high-profile deals like Whole Foods Market, PillPack, Ring, and MGM, but there is always more work to be done. We have a responsibility to use our success and scale for good, and we’ll keep working to hire, promote, and support attorneys and legal professionals of diverse backgrounds and skillsets.

How is Amazon supporting the growth of M&A lawyers?We have smart business partners who value our partnership, and the breadth of Amazon's business means we have a lot of variety in the types of deals we handle. We’re intentional about how we assign those deals to ensure team members have the diversity of work and experiences necessary to advance in their careers. Amazon’s legal leadership is also working with the OnRamp Fellowship to support female lawyers rejoining the workforce. This is exciting because it provides an avenue for women to come back to legal roles, including roles in M&A, with the resources they need to achieve work-life harmony as they ramp up.



Diversity Lab’s Onramp Fellowship aims to bring 200 women back into the legal profession by 2025

Through “OnRamp 200,” returning lawyers who have taken career hiatuses are provided with one-year paid fellowships at leading legal organizations, including Amazon.

What’s your favorite way to celebrate a successful deal?All acquisitions are a team effort, so I like to take time to do something fun to recognize the good work that made the deal happen. To mark the recent closing of the MGM acquisition, everyone on the team gathered for a celebratory post-closing lunch and we all wore T-shirts honoring some of MGM’s classic movies!If you could meet anyone from any point in time, who would it be?Michelle Obama. She’s so inspiring and she’s also a lawyer. I admire what she stands for and what she brought to the table as first lady of the United States, making the role her own. She’s a role model and somebody many of us look up to.What is one thing you wish you would have known at the beginning of your career?Early on, I didn't know about all of the things I could do with a law degree. Like a lot of people, I had a perception of what lawyers do based on what I’d seen on TV, and that was oftentimes a picture of lawyers in courtrooms. While that is definitely an available avenue, there are so many other careers where having a law degree is useful, and I’m glad I found a good match for my personality and skillset.What advice do you have for lawyers starting out in the M&A field?There’s space for you. Don’t be discouraged, even if you walk into a room and nobody looks like you. Things are changing, and there is a role for you.

The Disaster Relief by Amazon team helps us leverage our expertise in logistics to coordinate relief efforts around the world.

Millions of people around the world have been impacted by natural disasters—from hurricanes and floods and earthquakes to tornados. To help, Amazon has leveraged our expertise in logistics and mobilized employees and customers to donate to the Red Cross and UNICEF through our homepage in countries around the world. These initiatives were made possible by the Disaster Relief by Amazon (DRbA) team.

DRbA is the brainchild of Bettina Stix, an Amazon veteran who has been involved with leading the Amazon website teams in Germany and France. She has worked across the company supporting the product development for our international websites, driving worldwide customer service policies and knowledge management, leading product management for Prime benefits, and supporting expansion beyond delivery to launching Prime countries and technology. 




                “What if we could look at our systems and capabilities at Amazon from a disaster relief perspective and leverage what has already been built for our core businesses for disaster relief, delivering a ‘second return on investment?’”
            

Bettina Stix 




We sat down with Bettina to talk about DRbA, and learn more about how Amazon is working to make the world better prepared for the next disaster.How did you get the idea for Disaster Relief by Amazon? “I was wondering what role to take on next after Prime. I was going through a personal crisis of sorts at the time—my sister was terminally ill. In addition, my family’s history has been affected by the displacements after the Second World War, and I valued the power of altruistic support from early on. My personal life, my background, and my work experience at Amazon led to an epiphany: what if we could look at our systems and capabilities at Amazon from a disaster relief perspective and leverage what has already been built for our core businesses for disaster relief, delivering a ‘second return on investment?’” Our customers and employees have repeatedly expressed interest in helping people impacted by disasters with more than cash donations. Our customers have begun creating wish lists on Amazon to collect in-kind donations for humanitarian needs. Amazon.de (Amazon's German operations) had launched a campaign with the Red Cross to help Syrian refugees, while customers in India have created wish lists to help people impacted by the flooding in Chennai.How does DRbA leverage the power and scale of Amazon?We already invest immense resources into logistics, payments, and digital technologies that can be used to deliver a more effective response than many other companies could do. We could do so much better by preparing for a disaster just like we would for a product launch – working backwards from the victims as our customers, identifying the partner network to enable successful delivery, programmatically preparing and running operations, and above all, building it on top of the platform capabilities that Amazon provides.







What can Amazon do that no one else can?Our customers appreciate the wide selection and fast delivery at Amazon. In times of disasters, we are uniquely positioned to establish a quick ad-hoc supply chain to support relief efforts. For example, we sent our Prime Air planes with a full cargo load of humanitarian relief items to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. When the Red Cross needed sifters to help victims find their valuables in the ashes of their houses after the Northern Californian wildfires, we were able to provide them with that relatively rare item. And on top of this, we can give our customers the opportunity to contribute through direct cash donations from their Amazon account and purchases from curated lists. What have you learned from disasters to which Amazon has responded?There were two big positive surprises: The amount of support our team received from employees around the company who volunteered their skills; and the generosity from our customers who donated through Amazon more than $5 million in cash and in-kind gifts to the causes of the Red Cross and UNICEF. Knowing that we could enable others to help was what made me proudest.We would have loved to be of use to the efforts in many more ways, though effective help requires careful preparation and building relationships with those in charge of relief efforts. We continue to engage with authorities and relief organizations to explore how Amazon can do even more in the future.










Amazon opens Disaster Relief Hub in Atlanta for faster response to natural disasters   

Ahead of the 2021 hurricane season, Amazon donated and pre-positioned over 500,000 emergency supplies to help relief organizations respond to natural disasters in the U.S., the Caribbean, and Central America.

What has been the biggest challenge for DRbA?The biggest challenge has been the amount and rapid succession of unprecedented disasters. Our team worked around the clock from the moment Harvey was declared a Hurricane at the end of August to the beginning of November. The nature of our work makes scheduling and forecasting mostly unpredictable—just like it is for our colleagues at the relief organizations. You can’t respond to every crisis. How do you decide when and when not to act?If our employees are affected, if our customers care deeply, and if we actually have an effective way to contribute, we will respond.What’s next for DRbA?Not unlike other teams at Amazon, we strive to continually innovate. In our case we continue to explore how further we can leverage Amazon’s unique products and services for our cause. We had the privilege to collaborate with relief organizations at close range, and can now use that knowledge to create new ways to bring help to victims.

The new Glow device helps increase the quality time kids share with remote family members and parents who are miles (or minutes) away from home. 

Amazon Glow is here, and it forever changes the way kids stay connected with loved ones across the country or the city. Glow’s projector creates a 19-inch, touch-sensitive space for little ones to enjoy hands-on activities while adults simultaneously—and remotely—join in the fun, with a free companion app available on a tablet or smartphone they already own. Through Amazon Kids+, kids can connect to remote loved ones on a Glow video call to play games, solve puzzles, create art projects, read books, and explore new digital adventures together. Glow blends the physical and digital worlds, creating an experience that feels like sitting side-by-side, and is designed to foster quality interactive time between children and loving adults.

Amazon Glow reinvents how kids connect with remote loved ones







Families that had early access to Glow quickly embraced the “practically there” experience and encouraged kids to enjoy time with pre-approved family members—grandparents, aunts, uncles—whether they lived across the country or across town. Glow can also help parents erase the miles when work requires that they miss important daily moments, like family breakfast, homework help, after-school fun, and bedtime stories.No more missed bedtime storiesParents wish they could tuck their children into bed each night—but when that’s not possible, they get creative. According to new research* 64% of parents surveyed said they used a virtual solution to stay in touch with their little ones, including video chats (45%), phone calls (44%), and texts (33%). But even those solutions are far from perfect.“More than half the parents we surveyed said their kids had trouble staying engaged during traditional video-chatting calls,” said Joerg Tewes, general manager, Amazon Glow. “The Glow experience solves this, and is designed to let kids be kids in a world of animated games, vacuum erasers, scanning magic, and more that allows kids to do things with their parents rather than just listening. This playful learning helps working parents and extended family members develop deeper bonds with the children in their lives.

With guidance from leading experts in online wellness and safety, we share some of the latest thinking and advice to help you shape your kids' digital experience.

“Glow is on a mission to make kids’ lives better by fostering connections between children and their family, no matter where they are,” Tewes added. “As part of product development, we were influenced by child-development research that shows regular, active, and interactive play between children and loving adults can improve the lives of young children. This research inspired the new-to-world Glow experience that combines traditional video calling with an interactive, supersized, projected surface like no other that excites kids and delights grown-ups with all they can do together.”Adults use their smartphone or tablet to access the free Glow app, while the child uses Glow’s 19-inch, touch-sensitive projected space, which appears on the Glow mat. Glow is designed so that each person has a clear view of the other as they simultaneously engage in real-time activities.Introducing Glow to parents who travelGlow surprised a group of working parents who know the pain of being away from their families: long-haul drivers. These drivers, who on average spend two to three weeks away from their families at a time (according to CDL.com, a leading industry resource for U.S. trucking job opportunities), are often away from home for up to 300 nights a year—meaning they may miss 300 bedtimes with their kids. These parents and kids were the first to be invited to the Glow mobile station to see Glow fun firsthand, and some were even provided a free Glow device for their family.“Long-haul truckers know firsthand how challenging it is to stay connected with their children while on the road,'' said Tewes. “We decided to surprise families at the Mid-America Trucking Show to show these hard-working families how Glow can help erase the miles and make virtual together time more fun for everyone.”

Amazon Glow surprises long-haul drivers at the Mid-America Trucking Show







The Mid-America Trucking Show in Louisville, Kentucky has brought together more than 70,000 truck drivers and their families to explore innovative new technology and connect with others in the industry.“I’m definitely not a traditional mom. I’m on the road for four weeks at a time,” said Marcia Luchenbill, an Army combat veteran and mother of three who has been a truck driver for the past two years. “It’s calming to be on the road alone, but I miss real conversations with my family, cooking in the comfort of my own kitchen, and being able to cheer on my kids in their special moments.”Ready, set, Glow!Powered by Amazon Kids+, Glow has content featuring beloved characters from Disney, Pixar, Nickelodeon, Sesame Workshop, and Mattel—and provides parents, aunts, uncles, family friends, and grandparents with fun ways to delight and teach the young ones in their lives.With an Amazon Kids+ subscription, kids can use interactive Glow calls to engage with loved ones on another device. Some of the games and activities available include:Play games like ABC Charades, Chess, Checkers, Crazy Eights, Jigsaw, Memory Match, Rocket Racers, Whac-A-Mole, and more.Read thousands of books, including beautiful picture books, chapter books, and Animated Storybooks—created by Disney, specifically for Glow—based on some of Disney and Pixar’s most popular films.Create and collaborate on a virtual gallery of artwork, and add more fun by scanning in objects to create digital stickers.Blend the physical and digital worlds with Glow Bits, learnings kits sold separately. The first Glow Bits learning kit is Tangram Bits, where kids use physical shapes and their remote family member uses digital shapes to solve puzzles together.Many games and activities on Glow are also designed for siblings in the same house to play side-by-side or on their own if a remote family member is not available to connect on Glow.For more details and information and content updates, follow @AmazonGlow on Instagram and Facebook and show us how your family is having fun with the device by using #AmazonGlow.*Survey method: This random double-opt-in survey of 1,500 U.S. parents of children aged 3–9 and 500 U.S. parents who are away from home at least one week per month was commissioned by Amazon Glow on February 22, 2022. It was conducted by market research company OnePoll, whose team members are members of the Market Research Society and have corporate membership to the American Association for Public Opinion Research and the European Society for Opinion and Marketing Research.

Over the past month, nonprofit, government, and commercial customers have requested assistance in accelerating important humanitarian efforts that are helping millions of refugees and people within Ukraine and surrounding countries. Amazon Web Services (AWS) technologies and experts have been supporting a range of activities, including powering applications that are facilitating the intake of Ukrainian refugees at border crossings, providing technology to help establish safe evacuation routes, setting up emergency internet connectivity, and enabling secure communications.We are working closely with international aid organizations like Help.NGO, which specializes in emergency response, by providing technology resources that are supporting refugee needs. We are also working with local Ukrainian organizations, such as Optima School, the country’s largest distance learning school, to scale up and support the thousands of displaced students who now need access to online education.Because of the complexity of the work on the ground and the evolving security landscape, technology assistance can have an outsized impact on the success of relief efforts. This is why AWS is committing $15 million in cloud computing credits, and technical expertise, to continue supporting local and global organizations addressing this humanitarian crisis. Existing customers that would like to access these resources to further their efforts should reach out to their account managers, while new customers can get started here.We are thankful to be working with and supporting our customers who are tirelessly bringing aid to refugees at this critical time, and we will continue to stand with and support Ukraine.

Women are thriving in tech roles at Amazon Web Services—and they’re building and supporting programs to help others.

After working in the tech industry for more than 20 years, Donna Edwards knows what it’s like to be the only woman in the room. She now leverages that experience to serve as a role model for other women—something she feels Amazon Web Services (AWS) empowers her to do.






Donna Edwards, business development manager at AWS

Edwards, a business development manager in Perth, Australia, is on the AWS Training and Certification team. She saw the need to attract more women to technology careers when she joined the mentoring and training program AWS She Builds, which hosts events that support making tech more diverse. So she helped launch She Builds CloudUp, a program focused on helping women inside and outside of Amazon build cloud computing knowledge while also providing mentors and community, from both inside and outside of AWS. Demand for the program was so strong that it led her team to develop a second program to help prepare participants for the AWS Solution Architect Associate exam, which validates technical expertise in designing and deploying scalable, highly available, and fault-tolerant systems on AWS.










Changing the conversation

See how AWS is building a workplace where more people can thrive so that we can build technology that works better for everyone.

“Over the past 12 months, we’ve had tens of thousands of women register for these programs all around the world, showing how many women are in tech or interested in tech, and how important it is to provide these safe community spaces where women can learn together and have role models,” Edwards said. “Watching women join these programs and build their knowledge and confidence over the eight to 16 weeks is so rewarding and just makes me want to do more and more in this space.”Edwards is surrounded by women across AWS who share her passions for continuing to increase women’s representation in technology fields. Through employee community and affinity groups, women who work in technology roles at AWS are building more ways to advocate and inspire women and girls to follow a technical career path.“It is so important to form organizations and teams that have a mix of genders, backgrounds, and personalities so we have ideas that represent all of the communities and customers we serve,” Edwards said.Inspiring and leading changeWomen hold about 26% of tech-related roles in the global workforce, according to Gartner Research. AWS is focused on improving that number through company-driven efforts to increase diverse representation.






The AWS GetIT program encourages young students, especially girls, to pursue careers in technology.

AWS employees have amplified and supported company commitments to inclusion, diversity, and equity through their own advocacy that inspires girls and women to pursue education and careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). Numerous STEM-focused employee communities exist within Amazon and AWS, such as Women in Technology, Women in Engineering, Women in AI/ML (artificial intelligence/machine learning), Women in Big Data, and She Builds. With total membership in the tens of thousands, the employee groups provide a sense of community and encourage women at AWS to champion efforts that grow representation.










As diversity at AWS grows, women find a sense of belonging

Women employees say AWS’s efforts to increase diverse representation are rooted within the company’s culture.

The AWS GetIT program encourages young students, especially girls, to pursue careers in technology. Additionally, AWS is supporting programs to promote diversity in tech in communities globally. The programs include AWS GetIT, which inspires young students to gain digital skills and consider a career in technology while also empowering women at Amazon and AWS to build more confidence and leadership skills to become greater role models and advocates for inclusion, diversity, and equity in technology. Another program is We Power Tech, which promotes diversity in tech through educational content, partnerships, and programs aimed at helping to support underrepresented tech talent globally. In 2021, AWS announced a global partnership with Girls in Tech, a nonprofit founded in 2007 dedicated to eliminating the gender gap in tech. The partnership supports the Girls in Tech annual conference, digital career fair, a virtual mentorship program, and other events.Laura Verghote, an associate technical trainer for AWS global training delivery in London, is involved with AWS GetIT. She has mentored young girls in the UK-based Amazon Longitude Explorer Prize competition, which challenges young people ages 11 to 16 to design, test, and develop tech enterprises for social good. She said AWS’s involvement in these programs echoes the company’s inclusive work culture.

“I feel like AWS puts in a lot of effort to make the workplace as inclusive as possible. It’s also inspiring to have women role models in the leadership of our organization,” Verghote said.Overcoming disparitiesWhen Dhrithi Uday went to graduate school at the University of Maryland after completing her undergraduate work in India, she felt compelled to advocate for more women to pursue STEM careers. She believes women have to take action to eliminate obstacles for young women and girls.






Dhrithi Uday, wireless network engineer at AWS

“We have so many talented young women who can push technology,” said Uday, who works as a wireless network engineer in Seattle on the AWS global events team. She’s seen excellent programs at AWS that acknowledge and practice inclusion, diversity, and equity. For example, her team honors and celebrates holidays of all cultures, and she found out right from the start that AWS values pay equity.“My recruiter was very vocal about me getting pay equity that matched my teammates’, based on my experience,” Uday said.A supportive cultureRavali Pothireddy, an AWS software development engineer based in Seattle, has been mentoring high school girls entering colleges through the Built by Girls Advisors community group, where more than 750 women working at AWS and Amazon volunteer as mentors for the Built By Girls organization. Pothireddy is personally motivated to mentor aspiring young girls after experiencing a cultural shock when she moved from India to the United States.






Ravali Pothireddy, software development engineer at AWS

“In India, you’d hear things like, ‘You don’t have to worry about your career—you can just get married.’ But here in the U.S. and at AWS, if I say I want to grow my career, I have tons of people telling me what I can do to follow my dreams,” Pothireddy said. “Even in meetings, if the group is mostly men, my manager or senior manager will always ask me for my opinions or if I have something to add—it’s super supportive here.”Building skills, experience, and confidenceRomy van Es, an AWS partner management solutions architect based in London, is a graduate of AWS Tech U. The program offers recent university graduates around the world paid on-the-job training, mentorship, project-based learning, and real-world problem solving.






Romy van Es, partner management solutions architect at AWS 

She said the program is just one more way AWS is helping women and underrepresented groups develop their experience and confidence in technology roles. After studying physics at her university, where only 4% of the people in her master’s program were women, van Es has developed a personal drive to show girls and women that they can take ownership of their careers and be successful in technical roles.“I am super passionate about encouraging women to take ownership of their careers and to show them the possibilities they have with their talents, as I know what such support did for me,” van Es said. “Working at AWS, you really notice that ID&E (inclusion, diversity, and equity) is at the core of the culture. It’s present in the way people work together both internally and externally, in the way we provide feedback to each other, and in the mechanisms we have put in place to make sure ID&E is protected.”To learn more about how AWS is building a workplace where more people can thrive, or to browse open roles, visit Changing the conversation.

A new Amazon program offers resources and support for refugee and humanitarian-based immigrant employees, including a citizenship assistance portal, free legal support, and mentorship.

Amazon has launched the Welcome Door program, a new initiative to provide refugee and humanitarian-based immigrant employees with additional resources and support, along with reimbursement for Employment Authorization Document (EAD) fees. The program also offers employees access to upskilling opportunities, including free college tuition and English as a Second Language (ESL) proficiency through the Career Choice program.Additionally, Amazon is among the companies that have pledged to provide for the immediate needs and longer-term support for people fleeing Ukraine.“We have a variety of jobs and welcome all kinds of people, and we’re proud to offer enhanced support for refugees around the world,” said Ofori Agboka, Amazon’s vice president of People eXperience and Tech for Operations. “Being displaced from your homeland and having to start again somewhere new is challenging and emotional. It is an honor and a privilege to help make that transition easier and help people start again. Across our entire business and at all levels, we’re working with refugees to secure jobs and get the support they need.”Once refugees arrive in their new communities, they often face prominent obstacles when seeking jobs and resettlement support. In addition to language barriers and limited government resources, refugees with professional experience often have gaps in their careers, which can limit their knowledge of the latest developments within an industry, according to Upwardly Global, a nonprofit that helps refugees rebuild their careers.""Through my own experience, I have found that it is challenging to migrate to a new country, find a proper job, and learn a new language while overcoming social and financial challenges,"" said Khalid Noorzad, an Afghan refugee. ""Through Welcome Door, Amazon is addressing these challenges and providing employees peace of mind and the opportunity to just focus on their work, so I look forward to these new offerings.”






Khalid Noorzad, an Afghan refugee who came to the U.S. last year, now helps other refugees and humanitarian-based immigrant employees as an insourcing specialist on the Global team at Amazon.

Through the new Welcome Door program, Amazon refugee and humanitarian-based immigrant employees will have access to several new resources, including:Reimbursement for EAD renewal fees, which cost on average roughly $500 every other year.A new Citizenship Assistance Portal that will fully support U.S. citizenship applications for all eligible employees.Ongoing communications that will highlight policy changes that may impact an employee’s immigration status.Free legal resources to help navigate immigration-related questions and the ability to connect with immigration experts.Access to skills training benefits including free college tuition and ESL proficiency through Amazon’s Career Choice program.Customized mentorship.These new resources will be offered to Amazon employees in the U.S. starting in April, and the company plans to expand the program globally by the end of the year.“We’re very proud of Amazon’s commitment to better support its refugee employees, joining other companies in the Tent Partnership that are going above and beyond to give refugees the help they need to integrate in their new communities,” said Veronica Rossini, acting executive director at the Tent Partnership for Refugees. “With millions of people fleeing war and conflict in countries like Afghanistan and Ukraine, a good job is one of the most impactful ways for refugees to build a new life. I hope the Welcome Door program inspires many more businesses to ensure these incredibly talented, resourceful, and dedicated people have the tools and support they need to thrive in their careers.”










Our Upskilling Commitments

We want to make it easy for people to have access to the skills they need to grow their careers. We are making two big investments to help make that happen: investing in employees and providing free skills training opportunities to the public.

The legendary announcer and the Emmy-winning analyst will be the voices of ‘TNF,’ which kicks off September 15 on Prime Video.

Iconic play-by-play announcer Al Michaels and Emmy-winning analyst Kirk Herbstreit have joined Prime Video to call its exclusive coverage of NFL Thursday Night Football. The inaugural season of the historic 11-year agreement kicks off Thursday, September 15.The recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Emmy Award in 2011, Michaels recently completed his record 36th campaign as the play-by-play announcer of the NFL in prime time. Michaels called his 11th Super Bowl in February, matching the most ever for a television commentator.Herbstreit has served as the lead college football analyst for ESPN since 1996. In that time, he established himself as a preeminent voice in the sport, garnering 14 Sports Emmys for his work as both a live event analyst on ABC’s Saturday Night Football as well as a studio analyst on ESPN’s College GameDay.Fred Gaudelli, a 24-time Emmy-winning producer, will also join Prime Video as executive producer of Thursday Night Football. Gaudelli will lead the Thursday Night Football production on-site each week, as part of a collaboration with NBC Sports, continuing a storied career with his 33rd season as the lead producer for the NFL in prime time. Gaudelli, who produced his seventh Super Bowl in February, will continue on NBC Sports’ executive team and will serve as a key contributor to NBC Sunday Night Football’s editorial and production efforts.“Over the last 36 seasons, I’ve been at the mic describing some of the most magical moments and games in NFL history and am looking forward to many more,” said Michaels. “This is the new frontier in sports television and to be a part of the launch at this point in my career is both exciting and stimulating. The NFL is the king of unscripted television and I’m looking forward to joining Kirk to bring fans more dramatic episodes on Thursday nights this fall.”“I’m thrilled to be a part of Prime Video’s game-changing Thursday Night Football telecasts, and it’s an honor to join the booth alongside Al,” said Herbstreit. “Together, we will build the next generation of NFL programming. I’m proud to be part of the Amazon team and can’t wait to get started.”

In just 10 days, Amazon teams from around the world came together to build a new humanitarian aid hub in Eastern Europe—converting 5,000 square meters of warehouse space in Slovakia, previously used for customer fulfillment, into a facility that helps get much-needed supplies to Ukrainian refugees. This is the largest such hub Amazon has ever built, and it works in concert with the company’s broader infrastructure, innovative technologies, and global logistics network to provide critical supplies to front-line organizations as quickly and efficiently as possible.

With the hub up and running, a network of Amazon fulfillment centers across Europe is now preparing and delivering more than four million critical supplies donated by both Amazon and its customers—including shelter materials, hygiene items, blankets, and clothing. Working backwards from refugee needs, Amazon teams assess what supplies they must donate directly, procure any missing items, and then consolidate, pack, and ship the supplies needed by charities to do their lifesaving work. Customers in Europe can donate to support these efforts through dedicated Wish Lists on Amazon’s European stores.As these critical supplies come in to Amazon’s European network, the Amazon Transportation Services team is shipping them to the new hub in Slovakia, where space is exclusively carved out for the relief efforts. Once the products arrive at the hub in Slovakia, the donated supplies are distributed to displaced refugees in partnership with charities including Save The Children and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The strategic location of the Slovakia humanitarian aid hub will significantly expedite the movement of relief supplies throughout Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, Moldova, and Czech Republic to quickly help Ukrainian children and families in need.Launching this hub in less than 10 days was a huge team effort, and it’s gratifying to see much-needed supplies already flowing through and making their way to people in need. We’re thankful to our customers for their generosity and to our teams and our partners for their work and dedication to supporting refugees at this critical time, and we know this will be a long-term effort. If you’d like to learn more or offer support, you can do so by visiting Amazon’s donation site.This new hub is just one of the ways we’re working to support humanitarian efforts in the region, and you can learn more about our previous financial support and other actions.

Reused water from AWS data centers helps grow crops.

Along the banks of the Columbia River lies Umatilla, Oregon, a small farming community where agriculture has been at the heart of the local economy and day-to-day life for more than 150 years. It is also home to the data centers that power Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers’ applications. Recycled water from these data centers irrigates hundreds of acres of land in the local area, helping farmers grow crops like corn, soybean, and wheat.




                “Besides the land we own, water is one of our greatest assets.”
            

Vern Fredrickson, local farmer and vice chairman of the Board of Directors for the West Extension Irrigation District




That’s because five years ago, AWS and Umatilla community leaders worked together to develop a sustainable solution to recycle the water used to cool AWS data centers. The plan led to local municipalities and AWS investing in miles of new pipeline to deliver the water to existing canals, allowing 96% of all spent cooling water from AWS data centers to be reused in nearby communities. The plan also better managed the flow and availability of water for farming in the region and provided a new source of water for local farmers and residents. It marks the first time AWS has sent cooling water directly to an irrigation canal globally.“Besides the land we own, water is one of our greatest assets. Every gallon is important to the community, especially for farmers like me,” said Vern Fredrickson, a local farmer and vice chairman of the Board of Directors for the West Extension Irrigation District. “We’re glad to see businesses like AWS working with local officials to send water back to the community.”




































































































































To ensure water quality is maintained in the reuse system throughout the irrigation season, AWS installed water quality sensors, AWS Internet of Things (IoT) gateways that transmit data from the sensors back to the cloud, and AWS IoT Core cloud services that capture the data for analysis and automated alarming. These IoT services provide both AWS and the surrounding communities with peace of mind that water quality is maintained and always suitable for irrigation. The water reuse system makes millions of gallons of water each year available for the first time to farmers and residents in Umatilla and Morrow counties.“We wanted to partner with a good water steward like AWS to help develop a more sustainable approach to how we manage and maintain our water sources,” said Dave Stockdale, city manager for Umatilla. “Alongside the growth in jobs and opportunities from AWS operating here, we wanted to ensure that there were no negative effects on our long-standing history of agriculture.”

AWS Helped this City Develop Sustainable Water Practices | Amazon News







“The water we use is critical for cooling our data center servers, and although we use less than 1% of the freshwater in the region, we remain focused on minimizing our impact. We are grateful for the opportunity to work with the City of Umatilla and the Port of Morrow to be good water stewards in this community,” says Beau Schilz, Americas AWS Water Team. “We’ve built the infrastructure that allows us to give back millions of gallons of water annually to this community, and now we will build on this success in more places we operate around the world.”The innovative solution provides AWS a model to build on as it expands its sustainability-focused infrastructure to support AWS customers.

When Penny decided to give her living room a refresh, the last thing she expected was a visit to the emergency room. However, after losing her footing and falling to the floor, Penny needed all the assistance she could get. Home alone for the next few hours, Penny wondered how she would get the help she needed.







Read more about what Penny did next, in her own words:A few months ago, I decided to paint my living room and had moved all the furniture around and removed items from the walls. Once the paint dried, it was time to put the room back together. I fixed all the furniture back into its usual place, and then tackled the curtain rod over the window. I figured the easiest way to do it was to climb up onto the back of the couch, but I forgot just how slippery that material can be!Next thing I knew, my foot slipped from the top of the couch, sunk into a cushion, and I hurt my leg as I fell back onto the living room floor. I was so shocked—I laid there for a few moments trying to assess my pain and figure out what to do next. It was such a hard landing that I didn’t want to move my leg because I was so sure it was broken.As I was lying there on the floor, I ran through my options. My cellphone wasn’t within reach and I wasn’t sure I could move to get it. My husband is a pilot, so he was away for days. My son wouldn’t be home from his classes for hours. It would be a long while before anyone was coming home to rescue me.Then I remembered Alexa. We have Echo devices all over the house, and before this moment, we’d been using them for the daily stuff—managing our grocery lists, playing music, controlling our lights, and checking in on my family while I’m away for work. I remembered that Alexa could call my contacts, and so I called out and asked Alexa to call my friend and neighbor Celeste.







It only rang a few times before Celeste picked up, and I was so relieved to hear her voice. Celeste definitely thought I was joking at first, but eventually she realized I was completely serious and she ran across the road to come help me out. She stayed with me on the line through Alexa the entire time, right up until she came in to get me.  I ruptured my ACL and was so grateful I’d been able to get help when I did. Before the accident, I had been appreciative of how useful Alexa was in making my daily life easier, but this incident really reminded me how much safer it can help me feel. I was so grateful to have Alexa within earshot!We’re glad to hear that Penny is on the road to recovery and that Alexa was able to help out in a moment of need.

Amazon joins local community leaders and construction workers to celebrate completing the top floor of construction at Metropolitan Park.

Metropolitan Park, the first phase of our second headquarters' development in Arlington, Virginia, is taking shape as we celebrate an important milestone: the “topping out,” or completion of the highest floor of the building. So much has changed since we began construction more than two years ago in National Landing, and we can’t wait to welcome Amazon employees and the Arlington community to Metropolitan Park in 2023.Since we announced Arlington as the site of HQ2 in 2018, we’ve been committed to building an inviting space that benefits our employees and the entire Arlington community through our focus on nature, sustainability, and being great neighbors. The construction and design teams represent the diverse and vibrant economic impact this project is contributing to the local community. More than 4,800 skilled craftworkers and project managers are building Metropolitan Park and have devoted more than 2.2 million hours to this project. We appreciate their hard work and dedication.Our progress would also not be possible without the strong support of our partners—Clark Construction, JBG Smith, ZGF Architects, and Seneca Group—that share our commitment to the safe and sustainable construction of Metropolitan Park.







In addition to making great progress on construction over the past two years, we’ve built what we hope will be lasting partnerships across the community. With input from those partners, we’ve invested in the community in a number of ways. For example, working closely with the Arlington County Board, we’ve listened to local residents and included their feedback into the project, including over half a mile of new protected bike lanes, 2.5 acres of new and renovated public open space, and a daycare center for families in the neighborhood. Metropolitan Park’s two 22-story office buildings will include more than 50,000 square feet of retail space for local small businesses and a 700-person meeting center that will be available to local community groups. The entire complex will also be powered by 100% renewable energy.










First local retailers sign on to open shops at Amazon’s HQ2 

District Dogs and RĀKO Coffee are the first small businesses to sign leases at HQ2 as part of Amazon’s pledge to bring local, minority- and women-owned retailers to its second headquarters in Arlington, Virginia.

Since 2018, we have committed more than $34 million in total investments to local nonprofits, community groups, public schools, and businesses in the local community. This includes both monetary and in-kind donations, such as school supplies to public schools across Northern Virginia, supporting hyperlocal racial equity initiatives, and food donations to local food banks and pantries for families in need.These commitments are in addition to Amazon’s announcement in 2021 to create the Amazon Housing Equity Fund. The fund aims to preserve existing affordable housing and to create inclusive housing developments through low-rate loans and grants to housing partners, traditional and non-traditional public agencies, and minority-led organizations. To date, we have committed over $795 million in low-rate loans and grants to create or preserve up to 4,400 affordable homes in the HQ2 region, with more investments to come. We’re proud to share that, according to recent data provided by Arlington County, the Amazon Housing Equity Fund has increased the long-term committed multifamily affordable housing stock in Arlington by 22%.

The Nature Conservancy uses cloud technology to provide tree shade access in neighborhoods—regardless of income, race, or ethnicity. The story is part of Climate Next, a new AWS documentary series.

On average, low-income neighborhoods have about 15% less tree cover and are 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) hotter than high-income areas. This issue is called “shade equity,” a social and environmental justice concern focused on ensuring that shade is accessible in neighborhoods regardless of income, race, or ethnicity.In addition to providing cooling and reducing heat-related illnesses, evidence supports the premise that tree cover in cities provides significant health benefits for people, including lower levels of air pollution, better heart function, and improved mental health. Further, trees are one of the most cost-effective, nature-based solutions that can help us cope with the climate crisis. A California study found that every $1 spent on tree planting and maintenance in urban areas returns $5.82 in benefits.

“Urban areas are at the heart of the climate crisis, because that's where 80% of our North American population lives. If we want to reduce the impact of climate change on people's lives, we must consider how our cities are going to cope with the climate crisis,” said Dr. Tanushree Biswas, carbon program director at The Nature Conservancy (TNC), a global conservation organization.The disparity in tree cover is largely due to a series of consecutive policies that were championed by local authorities and further codified through federal actions throughout the 20th century. As population and infrastructure rapidly grew during the early 1900s, decisions were made to disinvest in neighborhoods where people of color resided. The federal government codified these decisions during the 1930s in a series of laws that gave locally authorized segregation policies the needed legal authority. The federally backed segregation policies, commonly referred to as “redlining,” divided residential neighborhoods and concentrated services, including the provision of green spaces, to wealthier and whiter neighborhoods. Communities deemed “hazardous” or “declining” were left without green spaces and other social services. In recent years, cities have been losing approximately 4 million trees each year, or 1.3% of the total urban tree stock, and American cities spend less than .3% of municipal budgets on tree planting and maintenance.




                “Nature is our best ally in resolving climate change.”
            

Dr. Tanushree Biswas
Carbon program director at The Nature Conservancy




People in urban environments are feeling the effects of this disinvestment. “We don't have a lot of trees. As a kid, I remember a lot of trees. I don't know what happened to them. They died off. People cut them down. I don't know. But it's similar to the food desert. It's a tree desert,” said Joe Ward-Wallace, co-founder of South LA Cafe and South LA Market in South Central Los Angeles. “We need trees here—it gets hot. It looks better when trees are around, and it makes people feel better.”Numerous studies show the relationship between tree cover and local temperatures in urban areas. We know less about the logistic feasibility of increasing tree cover to mitigate urban heat and address disparities in urban green spaces. To address this gap, TNC uses data and Amazon Web Services (AWS). TNC combines and analyzes data from a variety of sources, including satellite-based measurements of tree cover, available plantable areas in cities, land surface temperatures, and socio-economic variables (like block group demographic-economic estimates), to understand the spatial feasibility of a city to support trees.In a statewide assessment of nature-based pathways that address the climate crisis, TNC showed that urban California has up to 1.2 million acres of space available for urban afforestation and could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by planting trees on 500,000 available acres in disadvantaged and low income communities. A follow-up statewide assessment by TNC shows that California cities have space available for an additional 34 million trees. It also identifies where tree planting is immediately feasible, and predicts how much the temperature and urban heat island effects could potentially drop with the planting of new trees. According to a recent study, this would reduce the average urban land surface temperature and provide multiple co-benefits totaling $1.1 billion annually—including reduction in heat-related medical visits (more than 4,000 over 10 years) and 4.5 million metric tons of annual CO2 sequestration. In California, an annual investment of $467 million for urban afforestation using TNC's prioritization pathways will lead to $712 million of net annual benefits and serve 89% of the approximately 9 million residents in the lowest income quartiles of the state’s cities.

The geospatial data and research is even more powerful when it’s presented as a story. Esri ArcGIS StoryMaps—an AWS-powered tool that combines text, video, charts, and advanced interactive geospatial visualizations—does just that. TNC uses this tool to tell a story with its data and work with partners to make it actionable for local nonprofits and government agencies across various cities. Data stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and in Enterprise GeoDatabases like Amazon Aurora can be analyzed and brought into StoryMaps to show how a city changes over time. Using advanced Esri ArcGIS Server and Image Server tools running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) makes it fast and efficient to perform analysis and integrate the data in StoryMaps. In addition to displaying the geospatial data, StoryMaps organizes and styles the data to emphasize points in real-time complex illustrations.Once the data is translated into a StoryMap, TNC uses it as a tool to communicate with legislatures, policymakers, and stakeholders. For example, the entire Natural Climate Solutions (NCS) pathway report for California is available as a StoryMap. It provides easy access to maps and data, and contributes to an interactive user interface that shows possible opportunities for a multisector NCS intervention in the landscape. In addition, TNC can show opportunities for urban afforestation along with how it lines up with other climate mitigation pathways. This further assists conversations with policymakers, state agencies, and stakeholders.Following the completion of the NCS pathway report, TNC used the StoryMap to design a series of regional roundtable discussions with local and grassroots-level organizations across California to promote a bottom-up approach to understanding the barriers and challenges of implementing nature-based solutions in the region. They gathered folks from the urban, forest, and natural working land sectors to talk to each other, and identify barriers and solutions to using nature as a climate change solution. TNC also did a roadshow with its StoryMap, with state agencies, showing the potential opportunity of using nature across California to mitigate climate change. “Nature is our best ally in resolving climate change,” said Biswas. “StoryMaps helps us build the bridge to communicate science into action and take successful examples implemented locally to scale.”






The map shows the tree canopy coverage at the census tract level as it relates to the redlined areas of Los Angeles. The places outlined in yellow and red represent areas that were deemed by the government as “definitely declining” and “hazardous” communities, respectively. These regions experienced extreme divestment, which meant that there was a lack of financial support from governments and financial institutions to invest in the well-being of these communities. As a result, these communities have a lack of tree canopy coverage, as represented by the lighter color scheme.

One of the key principles is to deliver environmental justice and equity by increasing the tree canopy by 50% in the areas of greatest need by 2028.To help reach this goal, City Plants, an organization based in Los Angeles, collaborates with TNC scientists to translate science into action and achieve outcomes on the ground. Together, they aim to grow a greener future by engaging Angelenos to plant and care for trees throughout the city. The organization uses TNC’s science, research, tools, AWS technology, and actionable StoryMaps to help carry out an equitable tree-planting strategy in Los Angeles.






This photo captures the clear lack of shade and tree cover on a downtown Los Angeles street.

“I really like to see how we can use the best available science and information to help inform the decisions on the ground. City Plants is by no means alone in that journey, but we get to take the work of tree planting prioritization that TNC is helping to define through mapping and other innovative tools, and apply it directly here in Los Angeles,” said Rachel O’Leary, executive director at City Plants. “When we’re faced with huge, ominous, harrowing, scary ideas and issues like climate change, I see tree planting as a vehicle to overcome a lot of that anxiety and grow solutions together.”AWS Cloud services have been key to allowing TNC to store data, conduct research, and create actionable visualizations to make progress on its mission. Identifying space for additional trees is only a beginning step. While knowing where we can strategically increase tree cover and reduce shade inequity is an important step, much larger and sustainable funding mechanisms are needed. We must also ensure the maintenance of urban trees and scale efforts beyond individual cities. “The globe has to reduce its temperature, which means we have to work on something big. We have to really work together,” Biswas said. “We have to think, ‘What are the lessons that our partners have learned here that can be applied to other cities?’ That’s the power of cloud computing—the exchange of human knowledge.”AWS is proud to support innovation and nature-preserving organizations like TNC and City Plants, and will keep working to help future generations enjoy a tree-rich and sustainable environment.The AWS original four-part Climate Next documentary series features stories about people and communities around the world driving innovation and creating scalable solutions to address climate change.

The latest Amazon Fresh location is the world’s first grocery store pursuing Zero Carbon certification from the International Living Future Institute.

In an important milestone in meeting its Climate Pledge commitments, Amazon is seeking net-zero carbon certification for its newest Amazon Fresh grocery store. More than a dozen upgrades and features have been incorporated throughout the design and development of the 35,000-square-foot Seattle space to help make the store the world’s first grocery store to pursue the International Living Future Institute Zero Carbon certification. As a result of these upgrades, we expect the store will save nearly 185 tons of CO2e each year, equivalent to driving around the Earth 18 times in a standard passenger vehicle.1






























































“We are constantly thinking about what we can do to make the customer shopping experience easier, more seamless, and more sustainable,” said Stephenie Landry, vice president of Amazon Grocery. “We know many customers are prioritizing sustainability in what products they buy and where they choose to shop. With our newest Amazon Fresh store, we are taking the next step on our path to becoming a net-zero carbon business by 2040, and we welcome customers to experience this firsthand while shopping with us in this store.”










The Climate Pledge

Amazon is committed to building a sustainable business for our customers and the planet. In 2019, Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge—a commitment to be net zero carbon across our business by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement.

Updates to this store include transitioning to a CO2-based refrigeration system, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 38 metric tons per year compared to a conventional system. The store also uses steel byproducts in the concrete floor to reduce the embodied carbon—the carbon associated with the manufacturing and installation of the flooring—by nearly 40% compared to a standard concrete floor. Another critical change is the fully electric kitchen space, where our store teams prepare fresh food, that reduces the need for fossil fuel combustion in the store. We are also electrifying the store using 100% renewable electricity sourced from Amazon’s renewable energy projects, which helps us continue in our progress to power Amazon operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025.Some upgrades will be used at all of our Amazon Fresh grocery stores moving forward, such as lower-carbon concrete flooring, which will help to reduce our embodied carbon.“In order to deliver on our commitments to The Climate Pledge, we must work together across all areas of our business to develop solutions to decarbonize,” said Kara Hurst, vice president of Worldwide Sustainability at Amazon. “It’s meaningful progress to open our latest Amazon Fresh Store seeking net-zero carbon certification, and I’m proud of the innovation and technology that the store offers to customers and employees, and for the environment.”

Amazon Fresh seeks net-zero carbon certification for new store in Seattle







This Amazon Fresh location is seeking Zero Carbon certification from the International Living Future Institute (ILFI), a leading nonprofit dedicated to advancing sustainable building practices. ILFI-certified buildings must be energy efficient, have all electricity provided by renewable energy, demonstrate a reduction in the embodied carbon of building materials, and prove that all carbon emissions associated with the manufacturing and construction process have been neutralized. To receive certification, ILFI will review 12 consecutive months of performance data to ensure the new store meets this standard.“Amazon’s pursuit of Zero Carbon certification for its latest Amazon Fresh location shows an important commitment to verifiable carbon reductions,” said Lindsay Baker, CEO of the International Living Future Institute. “As the world’s first grocer seeking Zero Carbon certification, this approach represents an important benchmark for the grocery sector and the retailers overall.”Amazon will be able to measure the real-time impact of these upgrades via a system built by Amazon Web Services’ Professional Services Sustainability Practice. We will look to apply what we learn to future Amazon stores and buildings, helping accelerate our path to net-zero carbon by 2040 as part of The Climate Pledge.Customers shopping in-store will be able to choose from a variety of Climate Pledge Friendly products, ranging from grocery items to household cleaning and beauty products, such as Seventh Generation, Annie’s, Mrs. Meyer’s, Bob’s Red Mill, and Clif Bar. Newly launched Fresh Brand Plant-Based products like almondmilk and meat-alternative ground, patties, sausage, meatballs, and Chick’n nuggets are also available. As with all Amazon Fresh stores, customers can shop from a selection of organic meat, seafood, and produce. Excess food items will be donated to local food banks.










Climate Pledge Friendly makes it easier to shop more sustainably

Amazon is adding new certifications from major health, organic, and animal welfare organizations to help shoppers find more sustainable products.

As part of Amazon’s commitment to sustainability and local communities, this store is providing a donation to Tilth Alliance, a local nonprofit building community with farmers, gardeners, and families in Washington state to create a sustainable, healthy, and equitable food future.“Supporting safe, healthy, and sustainable business is critical to the infrastructure and resiliency of the City of Seattle and for our community,” said Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell. “We are excited to see Amazon bringing healthy food and carbon-conscious grocery shopping to the people of Seattle. The new Amazon Fresh store represents the kind of climate-forward action we hope to see from our business partners in our communities.”The location is the 26th Amazon Fresh grocery store in the U.S. and the fourth location to open in the greater Seattle area. We’re pleased to offer a new, low-priced grocery store in the community in addition to bringing hundreds of high-quality jobs to the area. Customers at the new store will experience the same great value and quality they expect with Amazon Fresh: free, fast grocery pick-up for Prime members, low prices, broad selection, package pick-up, and free Amazon.com returns, plus convenient shopping features like Alexa shopping list integration and Just Walk Out technology, which gives customers the option to skip the checkout line.
1 As a result of these upgrades, we expect the store will save nearly 185 tons of CO2e each year compared to an industry-standard grocery store, equivalent to driving around the Earth 18 times in a standard passenger vehicle. Calculation based on CO2e saved, using the EPA carbon calculator.

Smart farm solution built on Amazon Web Services helps small-scale farmers increase production of one of the country’s most popular cooking ingredients.

Every day, for years, SangYoung Park, a farmer in Geumsan County, South Korea, spent a substantial part of his day going back and forth to his farm’s five greenhouses to open and close the windows.If you think that sounds time-consuming and repetitive, you’re right—it was. But it was the only way Park knew how to protect his crop from daily variations in temperature and humidity.

This process was also unreliable. By counting on experience, advice from others, and the weather forecasts, Park sometimes got it wrong, and he would return the next morning to find a greenhouse full of wilted plants.Today, Park is no longer making educated guesses and unnecessary trips to open the windows. In fact, he doesn’t need to do it himself at all. Instead, he receives a recommendation from an app on his smartphone, and then, he uses the app to optimize the ventilation automatically—all thanks to a smart greenhouse system built on Amazon Web Services (AWS) that’s revolutionizing the way he runs his family business.The tasty crop in question is perilla leaf, a much-loved staple of South Korean cuisine. Anyone who’s tried traditional dishes, such as Korean barbecue, has almost certainly encountered it.













Photo by SeungHwan Jeong





















The system that tirelessly adjusts the ventilation in Park’s greenhouses is a technological solution called “G-Smart”—developed as part of a pilot program by Digilog, an agricultural technology startup, and the local authorities in Geumsan County, with support from AWS.When you enter one of Park's greenhouses, you’ll find cameras moving on an overhead rail, gathering images of perilla leaves, and sensors collecting real-time data on soil conditions, air temperature, humidity, solar radiation, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and other crop-related statistics.







The G-Smart system processes this information using AWS machine learning tools, to gain insights on leaf health and growth, as well as to make predictions on environmental changes and generate recommendations for farmers.“Many small-scale farmers have limited resources and access to investment,” said HyunKwon Suh, CEO of Digilog—named because its founders want to apply digital technology to the “analog domain” of agriculture for the benefit of farmers in South Korea and beyond.“The farmers tend to live and work in somewhat isolated environments, and understandably, they can be skeptical about change when they’ve been doing something the same way for 30 or 40 years. We’ve started with a small number of farmers who are open to trying something new. Once we’re able to demonstrate their success, we hope that will encourage more farmers to get involved.”The program aims to reach almost 2,000 farms in the future, save farmers valuable hours every day, and increase productivity by 5%. Through these efforts, Geumsan County is encouraging widespread adoption of smart farm and intelligent control systems. If it succeeds, the region will become the world’s largest producer of perilla leaf.

As one of the participating farmers, Park has not had to invest in any equipment. The project has funding from the local authorities, including Geumsan County, with the idea being that the pilot will allow the Digilog team to home in on the most significant growth factors for perilla leaf. This means that when brought to scale, G-Smart will only require farmers to spend a minimal amount on installing devices, while maximizing perilla leaf production and increasing income. Ultimately, farmers will benefit—along with everyone’s cooking.Digilog hopes to adapt the G-Smart solution so it can be used for other types of crops—for farmers in South Korea, then across Asia, and potentially, even further.“We want to bring value to the thousands of small-scale farmers who are currently excluded from the digital advancement taking place in our cities,” said Suh. “With the development of G-Smart, we’re showing how machine learning can have real, tangible impacts on people’s livelihoods. In the long term, we’d like to take this concept to as many farmers, in as many different countries, as possible.”










AWS empowers startups solving critical challenges in the cloud 

Amazon Web Services is launching two AWS Global Accelerator programs to help startups address some of the world’s most pressing challenges while building successful, cloud-based businesses.

For Park, taking part in the pilot has transformed how he thinks about farming.“At first, it was difficult to adapt, as everything was new to me,” he said. “But the process was easy, and the results, so far, have been really impressive. I now think this kind of technology is necessary for agriculture, if we’re going to keep up with the rapidly changing times.”Digilog developed the G-Smart solution and is now working to improve it, following a ‘Smart Farm Challenge’ workshop at the Cloud Innovation Center (CIC) in Busan. The center is part of AWS’s global CIC Program, an initiative that brings together nonprofit, education, and government organizations to collaborate on solutions to address real-world problems using cloud technologies.

The Amazon Housing Equity Fund has committed more than $1.2 billion to create and preserve over 8,000 homes, helping an estimated 18,000 people.

Amazon will provide over $124.4 million to build 1,060 affordable homes near four public transit sites while working in partnership with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (Metro) and Sound Transit, the transit system serving the Central Puget Sound region of Washington state, to complete the housing developments. This is part of Amazon’s $300 million transit commitment from 2021 to create 3,000 new affordable homes in collaboration with the transit agencies in each region.“The Amazon Housing Equity Fund is tackling the affordable housing crisis on multiple fronts and through innovative solutions, such as teaming up with public transit authorities, which brings people closer to more opportunities, services, and a better quality of life,” said Catherine Buell, director of the Amazon Housing Equity Fund, a more than $2 billion commitment to create and preserve 20,000 affordable homes for individuals and families earning moderate to low incomes in Washington state’s Puget Sound region; the Arlington, Virginia region; and Nashville, Tennessee. “We know that our investment in these areas brings many economic opportunities for residents in the region, but we also acknowledge that this growth needs to benefit everyone in the community. The progress we have made in our first year is promising, but we have more to do.”Since the launch of the Amazon Housing Equity Fund in January 2021, Amazon has invested more than $1.2 billion to create or preserve over 8,000 affordable homes for families earning between 30%-80% of area median income, including first responders, teachers, and service industry employees whose wages haven’t kept pace with escalating rents. For each Amazon-funded affordable home, rents will be maintained at levels affordable for low- and moderate-income families (generally for 98 to 99 years), and rents will only rise with wage growth as determined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 




                “The future is bright for smart growth near Metro and other transit options in Prince George’s County and throughout the entire region we serve.”
            

Paul J. Wiedefeld
General Manager and CEO of Metro 




As real estate prices continue to rise, this commitment will save affected families thousands of dollars annually. Based on the average rental household size in the zip codes of funded Amazon initiatives, the newly affordable homes will support an estimated 18,000 people across all three regions, nearly a quarter of whom are children. All 8,000 units are or will be within a 10-minute walk to public transit; this ensures that moderate- to low-income families can afford to live near—and benefit from—quality public transit.Investments in the Arlington, Virginia-Washington, D.C. RegionSince January 2021, the Amazon Housing Equity Fund has committed more than $795 million in loans and grants for the Arlington, Virginia-Washington, D.C. region to create and preserve more than 4,400 affordable homes. Based on data provided by Arlington County, through its efforts in the past year, the Amazon Housing Equity Fund has increased the long-term committed multifamily affordable housing stock in Arlington by 22%. The new transit-oriented housing commitments are:The Margaux at the New Carrollton Metro Station: In partnership with Metro and developer Urban Atlantic, Amazon is creating 291 new construction apartments, with guaranteed affordability for 98 years, adjacent to the Metro station in New Carrollton, Maryland, a major mixed-use, multimodal transportation hub for commuter rail and bus lines, Metrobus, Metrorail, Amtrak, and the Maryland Department of Transportation’s under-construction Purple Line. Amazon is funding $25.4 million in low-rate loans to Urban Atlantic to begin construction. The Margaux will offer 1-, 2-, and 3- bedroom units and is an essential part of the transformation of New Carrollton, a vital gateway to the Washington, D.C. region.

Atworth at the College Park Metro Station: In partnership with Metro and developer Gilbane Development Company, Amazon is creating 451 new construction apartments, with guaranteed affordability for 98 years, immediately adjacent to the Metro Station, bus lines, MARC Train, University of Maryland Shuttle Service, and under-construction Purple Line. The Atworth development includes a public park which will be used for community events focusing on health and wellness, such as hosting farmers markets to promote greater access to fresh food while supporting local businesses. The Atworth is within walking distance of the University of Maryland and the Discovery District, and it contains over 2 million square feet of office, laboratory, and research space for both private companies and public agencies. Amazon is funding a $56.3 million low-rate loan to the Gilbane Development Company to begin construction.

“The projects underway at New Carrollton and College Park are transforming vacant land and parking lots into vibrant mixed-use commercial and residential destinations generating more riders and revenue for Metro, as well as new residents, businesses, and tax revenue for our local and state partners,” said Paul J. Wiedefeld, general manager and CEO of Metro. “Thanks to Metro’s nation-leading joint development initiatives and Amazon’s commitment to affordable housing, the future is bright for smart growth near Metro and other transit options in Prince George’s County and throughout the entire region we serve.”Investments in Puget Sound, WashingtonSince January 2021, the Amazon Housing Equity Fund has committed more than $344.3 million in loans and grants for the Puget Sound region to create and preserve 2,870 affordable homes. Based on data provided by the City of Bellevue, through its efforts in the past year, the Amazon Housing Equity Fund has increased the long-term multifamily affordable housing stock in Bellevue by 20%.

The new game-based role-playing experience ‘AWS Cloud Quest: Cloud Practitioner’ and an enhanced AWS Educate program offer free hands-on learning opportunities for people seeking cloud computing skills.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is announcing two new, free training initiatives that make it easy for individuals to get hands-on cloud computing skills training in a fun and engaging way. The first initiative is a new game-based role-playing experience, called AWS Cloud Quest: Cloud Practitioner, ideal for early career or new-to-cloud adult learners. AWS Cloud Quest teaches foundational cloud computing concepts while learners zap drones and collect gems in their quest to solve challenges in a virtual city. AWS also launched a new, improved version of AWS Educate, with added interactive content and removal of the .edu email address requirement, making the program even more accessible. With AWS Educate, learners as young as 13 years old can access hundreds of hours of free, self-paced training, resources, and labs specifically designed for new-to-the-cloud learners.These two new initiatives support the development of foundational cloud computing skills, so anyone—from young learners to career professionals looking to build their cloud skills—can gain knowledge and practical experience that helps them prepare for jobs in the cloud.




                “When I had my first interview for cloud engineering, pretty much all the knowledge I discussed in that interview was based on what I learned from AWS Educate.”
            

Alfredo Colón
DevOps engineer, Universal Studios Orlando




“AWS Cloud Quest and AWS Educate intentionally move away from passive content. We want to make abstract cloud computing concepts real through interactive and hands-on activities that immediately let learners turn theory into practice,” said Kevin Kelly, director of Cloud Career Training Programs at AWS. “These two offerings help individuals grow their skills and employability. We’re continuing to innovate how learners can build their cloud knowledge and practical skills, meeting them where they are and bringing knowledge within anyone’s reach by making these programs free.”'AWS Cloud Quest: Cloud Practitioner' game-based learning

AWS Cloud Quest - Cloud Practitioner | Amazon Web Services







AWS Cloud Quest: Cloud Practitioner is an all-new 3D role-playing game, designed by AWS Training and Certification, to help adult learners gain practical AWS experience. To win, learners must complete quests that simultaneously build cloud skills and help citizens build a better city. Gameplay includes videos, quizzes, and hands-on exercises based on real-world business scenarios. Throughout their adventure, learners understand what the cloud is by exploring core AWS services and categories (e.g., compute, storage, database, and security services) and building basic cloud solutions. For learners looking to earn an industry-recognized credential, this program provides an engaging way to help prepare for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. AWS Cloud Quest is available globally in English for personal computers through AWS Skill Builder.AWS Educate: new content with greater reachAWS also released a reimagined AWS Educate program worldwide, including new courses and hands-on labs, making it easier than ever for individuals as young as 13 years old to register. AWS Educate is designed for self-motivated, pre-professional learners who are not yet working in the cloud, such as students and job-training participants.







The program offers hundreds of hours of free, self-paced training and resources—including more than 50 courses and 10 hands-on labs in the AWS Management Console—so learners can practice their skills. New features include:Four new courses: Cloud Computing 101, AWS DeepRacer Primer, Machine Learning Foundation, and Builder LabsTen new labs: help learners put theory into practiceRedesigned website: guides learners to training content based on their knowledge, goals, interests, and ageNew online Explore section: features supplementary content, such as new courses, Twitch videos, blogs, and technical papersSince the program’s inception in 2015, AWS Educate has reached over a million learners globally, helping individuals like Alfredo Colón, who lost his job because of Hurricane Maria and moved to Orlando, Florida, to rebuild. He completed more than 20 career pathways with AWS Educate and got an interview with Universal Studios Orlando, where he demonstrated his cloud knowledge and landed a job as a DevOps engineer.“When I had my first interview for cloud engineering, pretty much all the knowledge I discussed in that interview was based on what I learned from AWS Educate,” Colón said.Learners looking to validate their knowledge can earn AWS Educate badges and prepare for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. AWS Educate also provides a bridge to potential employers through the AWS Educate Job Board, which features thousands of cloud computing job postings, where adult learners (18 years old and up) can explore and apply to in-demand jobs and internships.AWS Educate is available globally in English, Chinese (simplified), Japanese, Korean, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish.Ultimate goal: provide free training to 29 million people worldwideAWS Cloud Quest and AWS Educate are part of Amazon’s commitment to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to provide free cloud computing skills training to 29 million people by 2025—reaching people from all walks of life and all levels of knowledge, in more than 200 countries and territories.

61,"April 21, 2022",Amazon Fresh is on its way to net-zero carbon with newest store,"



Washington state legislators made history this year through strategic investments in our state’s transportation system that will help move the entire state forward. As Washington's largest private employer, with more than 85,000 employees, and the operator of an expansive logistics network, we at Amazon are especially interested in the transportation system and have a long history of advocating for its maintenance and expansion. We know that transportation investments help everyone, as Washington residents rely on transportation infrastructure to commute to work, deliver goods, and participate in economic activity.We thank Senator Marko Liias and Representative Jake Fey for their leadership on the recently passed bicameral infrastructure proposal, “Move Ahead Washington,” and we thank the legislators who passed this bill for the benefit of our state’s residents and continued economic growth.This package will fix old bridges, patch our roads, and help ensure clean air and water through projects that address smog, fish barriers, and stormwater runoff. It will improve system reliability, reduce carbon emissions and traffic, and offer more innovative travel choices. It will provide near-term construction jobs as we recover from the COVID-induced recession, along with long-term economic benefits that come from improved infrastructure. It also makes significant progress on our state’s maintenance, operation, and preservation backlog while continuing to build a clean and equitable transportation future. It’s the right package for right now.It includes key projects like the I-405 corridor, bus rapid transit on I-405, the Eastrail bike and walking path in Bellevue, and the Mountains to Sound Greenway to support the rapid job growth on the Eastside while reducing carbon emissions. The package also wisely leverages federal funds through continued investment in the Cascadia Ultra-High-Speed Rail Corridor, and it includes innovative clean transportation programs like electric ferries.

We know the state can’t do it alone, and the private sector will continue to partner and support these important investments. Amazon is working to do its part by providing $7.5 million to Eastrail by funding transit options and reducing commutes, and by purchasing 100,000 electric delivery vans. We’re also investing billions of dollars in affordable housing infrastructure and related climate action.We appreciate the great leadership shown by our legislators, Governor Jay Inslee, and officials at the State Department of Transportation who have invested many hours in thoughtful ideas and community outreach. We’re proud to help lead Keep Washington Rolling, the broad coalition of business, labor, environmental groups, and local governments that provided a united voice of support for increased investment. Strong leadership and collaboration helped enact these transportation investments, allowing individuals and businesses in our state to continue to thrive.

More than 300 businesses across 51 industries and 29 countries have now joined The Climate Pledge and committed to meet the Paris Agreement 10 years early.

Amazon and Global Optimism announced that more than 300 companies have now signed The Climate Pledge, marking a nearly 600% growth in signatories over the past year. Among the nearly 100 new signatories joining are the world’s largest container shipping company, Maersk; the leading enterprise software developer SAP; the North American timberland company Weyerhaeuser; the largest residential solar company in the U.S., Sunrun; and the leading brand in connected car and audio services, HARMAN.Signatories to The Climate Pledge must agree to:Measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis.Implement decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement through real business changes and innovations, including efficiency improvements, renewable energy, materials reductions, and other carbon emission elimination strategies.Neutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial offsets to achieve net-zero annual carbon emissions by 2040.“The effects of climate change are becoming more and more apparent in our surroundings and daily lives, and we firmly believe that the private sector must continue to innovate and collaborate across regions and industries in order to decarbonize the global economy at scale,” said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO. “It’s an encouraging sign that more than 300 businesses have now signed The Climate Pledge, which commits them to confronting climate change head-on by incorporating real business changes that will make a lasting impact on our planet. We can only do it together.”Many of the new Pledge signatories are already making great strides toward reducing their carbon emissions:MaerskMaersk is providing industry-leading green customer offerings across the supply chain, including Maersk ECO Delivery, which targets emission reductions in ocean shipping. Amazon began participating in this service in 2020 and continues today. Amazon’s participation reduced emissions by approximately 20 KTonnes of CO2e (the equivalent of 50 million average passenger vehicle miles) in 2021.“Solving the climate emergency and decarbonizing our customers’ supply chains is a strategic imperative for Maersk,” said Soren Skou, CEO of A.P. Moller–Maersk. “Hence, back in January 2021 we accelerated our decarbonization commitment to net-zero emissions by 2040—a decade ahead of our initial 2050 ambitions and the Paris Agreement. To drive the massive scale-up of green fuels, we all must move now and take action. If we are meant to see changes this decade, we cannot afford to wait, and in that context, we look forward to joining The Climate Pledge, an opportunity to team up with some of our major customers, learn from them, and share best practices and solutions.”SAPSAP recently accelerated its target for achieving net-zero carbon emissions to 2030—20 years earlier than originally targeted.“Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time, and the time to act is now,” said Christian Klein, SAP CEO. “Technology provides us with an opportunity to create a lasting, positive impact for future generations, and SAP is proud to join The Climate Pledge to help drive this change.”WeyerhaeuserWeyerhaeuser is sustainably managing forests and manufacturing wood products across North America to provide a sustainable supply of wood for homes and countless other products while protecting wildlife habitat and serving as a natural climate solution through carbon sequestration and storage. Weyerhaeuser reforests 100% of its timberlands after harvesting—planting between 130 and 150 million trees each year.“Sustainability has been a guiding principle at Weyerhaeuser for well over a century, and we have long believed that our company has an obligation to make a positive impact in our communities and for society more broadly,” said Devin W. Stockfish, Weyerhaeuser president and CEO. “Our working forests and the sustainable wood products we produce play a critical role in helping to mitigate the impacts of climate change. And as part of our ongoing sustainability efforts, we have published our inaugural, peer-leading Carbon Record and established a leadership position among our North American industry peers by setting an ambitious, science-based greenhouse gas reduction target. Signing on to The Climate Pledge reflects our commitment to achieve these goals and to help lead on the path to net-zero emissions globally.”




                “The business community must have a clear path forward: Step up and accelerate emissions reductions so that we might avoid the worst of the damages yet to come.”
            

Christiana Figueres
Founding Partner of Global Optimism and the United Nations' former Climate Chief




SunrunSunrun’s systems have prevented 8.1 million metric tons of carbon emissions, which is equivalent to negating 20 billion miles driven by an average passenger vehicle.“At Sunrun, people and the planet are our north star,” said Mary Powell, Sunrun CEO. “Since our founding, we've helped more than 660,000 customers across the U.S. switch to clean energy and reduce their carbon emissions through our home solar and battery storage systems, and we're just getting started. We're laser focused on finding more ways to electrify homes and enable all Americans to take action on climate change, reduce energy costs, and gain energy independence. We are proud to demonstrate this commitment by signing the Climate Pledge alongside other sustainability leaders.”HARMANWith a long-standing focus on purpose, sustainability is one of HARMAN’s key strategic business pillars. As part of HARMAN’s commitment to achieving net-zero carbon across Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 2040, it’s working toward ambitious, measurable shorter-term targets that aim to reduce emissions, energy usage, and waste across its value chain. HARMAN has introduced new product lines made from responsibly sourced and recycled materials and has committed to 100% renewable energy in all HARMAN factories by 2025.“At HARMAN, we know that driving sustainability is an ongoing journey that benefits from constant collaboration,” said Tom Mooney, HARMAN senior director of Government Affairs and Sustainability. “Each of the other Climate Pledge signatories is as committed as we are to building a more sustainable future and understands the value of working together toward our common goal. We’re excited to be joining forces with this community of innovators and thought leaders to create meaningful change.”










The Climate Pledge

Amazon is committed to building a sustainable business for our customers and the planet. In 2019, Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge—a commitment to be net zero carbon across our business by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement.

The Climate Pledge also welcomes several companies that have previously received investments through the $2 billion Climate Pledge Fund, Amazon’s corporate venture capital fund that invests in companies that can help accelerate a path to meeting The Climate Pledge. These companies include BETA Technologies, an electric aerospace company, and Infinium, a renewable fuels technology company, which both aim to support decarbonization efforts in the global transportation sector. The sector was responsible for approximately 7.3 billion metric tons of carbon emissions in 2020. Nearly 13% of signatories represent transportation, aviation, and logistics sectors, sending an important signal that there will be rapid growth in demand for products and services that help reduce carbon emissions in this key sector.Additionally, Climate Pledge Fund investee and new signatory Pachama is bringing quality, transparency, and scale to nature-based carbon markets. Pachama uses remote sensing and machine learning to measure carbon stored in forests and monitor them over time, allowing organizations and individuals to compensate for their emissions with confidence by supporting reforestation and forest conservation projects.The latest report from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emphasizes the need for immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to invest in natural climate solutions to limit warming to close to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and to mitigate damages.""In the face of great peril, which is what the latest science depicts, the business community must have a clear path forward: Step up and accelerate emissions reductions so that we might avoid the worst of the damages yet to come,” said Christiana Figueres, founding partner of Global Optimism and the United Nations' former climate chief. “It’s encouraging, therefore, that 300 companies are committed to working together to achieve net-zero by 2040 or sooner through The Climate Pledge. But 300 companies are not enough to deliver the transformations we need. I encourage all business leaders to get to grips with the science, translate it for their businesses, and enable the changes we need without delay.”In 2019, Amazon and Global Optimism co-founded The Climate Pledge, a commitment to reach the Paris Agreement 10 years early and be net-zero carbon by 2040. Now, 312 organizations have signed The Climate Pledge, sending an important signal that there will be rapid growth in demand for products and services that help reduce carbon emissions.Learn more about all 312 signatories that have committed to The Climate Pledge and the actions they are taking to decarbonize their businesses.

63,"April 21, 2022",Amazon adds seven new artists to its Artist in Residence program,"


 The Alexa Fund helps these women founders innovate to make education comprehensive and entertaining.

The Alexa Fund’s mission is to invest in companies that drive innovations in voice, artificial intelligence, and ambient computing that positively impact customers’ lives. We believe that a great place to start is an education in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and a passion for reading. To that end, we want to help parents ignite a passion for well-rounded learning in their kids and students. The Alexa Fund, with its wide portfolio of startups in fields from robotics to gaming to health to—you guessed it—education, invests in and supports founders and innovators who are bridging the gaps between every part of a comprehensive education, and between learning and fun. Unruly Studios co-founder Bryanne Leeming and Zoobean co-founder Jordan Lloyd Bookey bring different backgrounds and approaches to education. Lloyd Bookey and her company help libraries and schools use technology and data to inspire their students and young patrons to read. Leeming uses a play-based curriculum to bring a foundational STEM education—covering a range of subjects—to kids in classrooms of all shapes and sizes. Despite their distinctive methods, both are using computing and technology to make a well-rounded education accessible to children everywhere. Unruly Studios, Bryanne Leeming Leeming learned to code by playing games. Now she’s helping students across the U.S. and Canada to do the same through Unruly Studios. 






Bryanne Leeming, Unruly Studios co-founder

Unruly Splats, Leeming’s brainchild, is a cross-curricular program that brings STEM to classrooms through play. Teachers and students use tablets to drag and drop code that sets rules for Unruly Splats— the durable floor buttons for which the program is named—to light up or make different sounds. Students, mostly in elementary schools, then stomp on them in a variety of games like whack-a-mole, relay races, or dance experiences.“Ultimately, they’re building games together with friends,” Leeming said. And Unruly Splats does seem like it’s all fun and games. In large part, at least for students, that’s because it is. But Unruly Splats is also a product of Leeming’s reflections that the way most students are introduced to coding is “often a very similar experience that attracts the same kinds of kids.” That reflection is widely validated by the largely homogenous makeup of the tech industry. Leeming, a lifelong athlete with a degree in cognitive science, thought she could tap into kids’ penchant for play as a way to make STEM more appealing to a wider range of students.













Kids playing Unruly Splats with their teacher.





















“Connecting it to things that are creative, connecting it to sports, these things invite a whole new range of kids into computer science,” Leeming said. Because the STEM aspect of the Unruly Splats program is nearly invisible, teachers in a range of subjects from physical education to language arts to math have employed the program to tremendous success. That’s intentional. “We built this adaptable program and teachers take it even further into their subject areas,” Leeming said. “[I’m] always so inspired by what our teacher community comes up with.” The Unruly Studios team, which runs the Unruly Splats program, has been particularly surprised by the use cases in music. Leeming references a music teacher in Florida who wasn’t able to use instruments in her classroom because of the pandemic, so she began using Unruly Splats instead. The music teacher assigned a specific music note to each Splat, Leeming said. Each student had their own Splat, and despite being spread out, they were able to play a song together.While coding and STEM are fundamental to the Unruly Splats curriculum, Leeming doesn’t see creating future programmers as the goal of the program. Her own exposure to coding in elementary school empowered her to use technology with a purpose. It’s her aim that Unruly Splats does the same for students everywhere. “We think computer science should just be a part of the day. Tech is everywhere, and we really want kids to be able to relate to it in all these different contexts,” Leeming said. “We feel like if you get this exposure, you’ll feel like you can see yourself there. You’ll feel invited, you’ll feel like technology is approachable. Then it’s going to help you no matter what.” 










STEM education as a diversity driver in tech

Amazon recently commissioned a study to explore the timely need for more computer science and STEM education for students from underserved and underrepresented communities to best prepare them for jobs of the future.

Though their headquarters are in Boston, Leeming and Unruly Studios moved out to Seattle in the summer of 2018 to participate in the three-month Alexa Accelerator, which is now Alexa Next Stage. The program, which connects founders to mentors, and opens up a host of resources within Amazon and beyond, is just one of the many ways Leeming says working with the Alexa Fund has helped her and Unruly Studios. Most notably, the Alexa Fund aided Leeming in building a community among—and relationships with—other founders, including the founders of a book-of-the-month club that has undergone an incredible transition, and now is helping libraries and schools turn students and adults alike into lifelong readers.That book-of-the-month club is Zoobean.Zoobean and Beanstack, Jordan Lloyd BookeyThe Zoobean story starts in a place with which many parents are familiar. Soon-to-be co-founders Jordan Lloyd Bookey and her husband Felix were trying to prepare their 2-year-old son to be a big brother. They searched and searched for books that would help him understand what having a baby sister might be like, but, being an interracial and interfaith couple, they struggled to find a book to which their son could relate. Then a librarian friend recommended the book All the World, and as they read it their son lit up, recognizing himself and the little sister he would soon have. 






Jordan Lloyd Bookey, Zoobean co-founder

That joyous moment of recognition ultimately inspired the couple to found Zoobean, the company that now helps schools and libraries bring the wonders of reading to students around the world. Originally launched as a curated book-of-the-month club, Zoobean’s path has taken them from Lloyd Bookey’s home to the stage of the TV show Shark Tank, and the company has continued to evolve—and embrace technology—every step of the way.“We wanted to recreate that magical feeling for other people,” Lloyd Bookey said. “While that’s where we started, it’s nowhere near where we are now.” Zoobean’s next iteration was as a reader advisory for public library systems, and eventually, they launched Beanstack, the gamified platform with an interface that makes logging reading time easy and fun, helping schools and libraries create reading challenges that build lifelong readers. Then came the pandemic.“People who didn’t have an online solution needed an online solution, and it meant that we had extreme growth in a really short period of time,” Lloyd Bookey said. As the chief client-success officer, she ensured that Zoobean’s clients were getting the most of the program, and Zoobean’s rapid growth necessitated some changes for her team. “It meant we had to revisit our processes,” she said. “As a client-success team and as a company we grew up a lot during that time, because before, we could work personally with a lot of clients. We still do work as personally as possible, but we had to scale.” And scale they have. Lloyd Bookey and her team have implemented resources, how-to guides, and community platforms to help schools and libraries from Sacramento to Auckland integrate with Beanstack. They even have a webinar program for clients to share best practices among an expanding community of readers. As her company has grown, the Alexa Fund has been there right alongside Lloyd Bookey and the team that she calls her family, as well as her literal family. She said the Alexa Fund has helped with everything from connecting Zoobean to internal resources, to helping with decision-making.“We view Alexa [Fund] as a trusted advisor,” Lloyd Bookey said. “Children are more likely to eat apples if they are sliced for them. So, we always say, ‘Slice the apple.’ Like Alexa, our goal is to make it easier for people to do things.” Zoobean has sliced the apple for readers in a lot of different ways over the years, and it continues to innovate with timely, curated reading challenges, an engaging app, and a new initiative to launch its own reading content. The goal remains the same: to bring the joy of reading to people everywhere. “Having this love and desire to read from a young age means that you’re going to be a lifelong reader,” Lloyd Bookey said. “It means that you’re going to have more opportunities, better test scores, and other sorts of things later in life as well. That’s definitely what keeps us motivated.”

Amazon Web Services is launching two AWS Global Accelerator programs to help startups address some of the world’s most pressing challenges while building successful, cloud-based businesses.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is accepting applications from startups for two accelerator programs. Ten startups will be selected to participate in each of the following programs: AWS Space Accelerator assists startups using the cloud to reimagine commercial and government space missionsAWS Sustainable Cities Accelerator supports startups building mobility and transportation solutions to increase the sustainability of fast-growing urban centersStartups play an important role in driving innovation that improves lives and addresses issues facing societies, governments, and industries. For more than 15 years, AWS has empowered startups to take on massive challenges and build lasting companies with far-reaching impact. The AWS Startups team is made up of ex-founders, venture capitalists, technologists, product leaders, and subject matter experts who support startups every day in different ways, including through accelerator programs like these that provide support and fuel innovation in specific areas. The programs we've launched build on successful 2021 AWS accelerators for space and clean energy startups.

While each four-week program is designed for a specific cohort and challenge, participants across the board gain access to powerful support, guidance, and perks such as:Up to $100,000 in AWS Activate credits to use toward cloud infrastructure and advanced servicesCollaboration opportunities with AWS customers and members of the AWS Partner NetworkMarketing and go-to-market supportSpecialized AWS training and mentoring from domain and technical subject matter expertsGuidance on business development and fundraising from AWS and accelerator program collaboratorsOpportunity to network with other startup founders who are navigating similar challengesApplications for the AWS Space Accelerator and AWS Sustainable Cities Accelerator programs are open now through April 15. AWS Space Accelerator Exactly 75 years ago this month, a camera aboard a V-22 rocket returned the first photograph captured just above the Karman Line, the official boundary between Earth’s atmosphere and outer space. Advances in engineering are helping to transport human technology far beyond Earth’s atmosphere. As the rapid pace of innovation continues across the global aerospace industry, much of that innovation will continue to come from startups. This is why we’re launching the next AWS Space Accelerator, in collaboration with AlchemistX. The program is open to space startups around the world with innovative ideas for using the cloud to reimagine solutions for both government and commercial space missions. The 2022 AWS Space Accelerator builds on the success of the 2021 cohort of startups, which represented an amazing breadth of solutions related to Earth observation, robotics, spacecraft launch and delivery, spacecraft hardware and software, satellite operations, human space travel, and launch operations.“The accelerator opened the eyes of our team to all of the opportunities and challenges in the emerging space market,” said Adam Kaplan, CEO of Edgybees. Learn more about this announcement and the AWS Space Accelerator. AWS Sustainable Cities Accelerator Cities occupy just 3% of the Earth's land but account for 75% of carbon emissions. With the urban population expected to grow from 4 billion to 6 billion people by 2045, developing sustainable cities is a critical part of the fight against climate change. The AWS Sustainable Cities Accelerator—launching in collaboration with Freshwater Advisors and Public Spend Forum—focuses on a specific and critical part of the equation: mobility and transportation. AWS is looking for mature clean-tech startups from around the world that are working on micro-mobility, last-mile delivery, urban parking and route optimization, electric vehicle charging infrastructure and applications, Internet of Things (IoT) transportation and traffic optimization, or other solutions to promote sustainable transportation and mobility in urban settings. The goal is to help these startups learn how to innovate and accelerate their growth through advanced cloud-based technologies. This is the second sustainability-focused accelerator program, with last year’s AWS Clean Energy Accelerator resulting in multiple commercial pilot deployments for participating startups. “The AWS Clean Energy Accelerator was a comprehensive program that educated me on all aspects of our business—go-to-market strategy, policy and regulation, funding resources, and much more,” said James Larson, CEO of E-Zinc. “I also developed some fantastic relationships during the program and am truly grateful for the connections I made.” Learn more about this announcement and the AWS Sustainable Cities Accelerator.

Together, Amazon and the BOTTLE consortium will focus on reducing plastic pollution through innovation in materials and recycling.

Imagine a new technology that breaks down existing plastic materials to create a new, innovative type of material. This new material could then be broken down more easily when recycled—and even biodegrade in natural environments.That scenario does not have to be imaginary. In fact, the mission of the BOTTLE consortium—a key research initiative under the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), launched in 2020—is to bring these new technologies and materials to life. BOTTLE stands for “Bio-Optimized Technologies to keep Thermoplastics out of Landfills and the Environment."" The consortium, led by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), was created to spur innovation and advance new technologies to address plastic pollution by bringing together cutting edge talent and capabilities from both the public and private sectors.Amazon has joined the DOE-backed project to help further its progress in developing chemical upcycling. The research collaboration is a way of handling today’s plastics and ensuring tomorrow’s plastics are recyclable by design.“Plastics are extremely versatile materials, and often they are still the best option available for a myriad of functions,” said Gregg Beckham, BOTTLE’s CEO and a senior research fellow at the NREL. “Finding a way to better recycle single-use plastics while reducing and ultimately eliminating their use is a grand challenge of our time, and we’re committed to pursuing scientific advancement to this end. With Amazon’s innovation expertise, we’re excited to work together to find solutions that have the potential to have vast, positive impacts.”As part of the consortium, Amazon’s growing team of materials scientists and experts hopes to develop technologies and materials that will enable the full life cycle of plastics to be net-zero carbon. Amazon’s team will work with the consortium to create new energy-efficient technology that will break down different kinds of plastics and turn them into valuable materials that can be used to make the same types of plastics or new plastics. In cases where the materials don’t make it back into the recycling stream, the molecular structure of the new materials will be designed to biodegrade in natural environments.










Introducing Amazon Aware, a new line of everyday essentials

Amazon Aware includes apparel, home, beauty, and more—all thoughtfully designed and made from materials such as recycled polyester, organic cotton, and bio-based ingredients.

This research is another step in Amazon’s efforts to eliminate or reduce packaging waste. As of 2021, Amazon had reduced the outbound weight of packaging per shipment by 36%, a total of one million tons, while increasing the use of recyclable materials.The BOTTLE consortium is currently supported by the Bioenergy Technologies Office and the Advanced Manufacturing Office, both within DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. Its partners include four additional DOE research laboratories and five universities.“In partnership with BOTTLE, we plan to make significant progress in developing new technologies and materials that will lead to less material in landfills and more back into the circular economy,” said Alan Jacobsen, principal materials scientist at Amazon. “Science and innovation are at the heart of our sustainability work at Amazon, and we’re committed to using our size and scale to reduce and eliminate our use of materials and find new ones that can be applied to our operations and other industries around the world.”Learn more about the science behind Amazon’s work with the BOTTLE consortium and Amazon’s sustainable packaging efforts.

Updated on March 8 to include the fact that AWS is no longer accepting new sign-ups based in Russia or Belarus.Alongside supplying humanitarian relief and support to Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), to help those affected by the violence, AWS has been working closely with Ukrainian customers and partners to keep their applications secure. Teams of Account Managers, Security Specialists, Solutions Architects, and other technical professionals are working around the clock to help customers and partners at this critical time. We are helping these customers employ security best practices, through following our Well-Architected Framework, to ensure that workloads are protected. In other cases, we are building and supplying technical services and tools to customers in Ukraine to help them securely migrate their on-premises infrastructure onto AWS in order to protect it from any potential physical or virtual attack. For several weeks, we have been partnering closely with Ukrainian IT organizations to fend off attacks and working with organizations in Ukraine, and around the world, to share real-time, relevant intelligence. As a result, our teams have seen new malware signatures and activity from a number of state actors we monitor. As this activity has ramped up, our teams and technologies detected the threats, learned the patterns, and placed remediation tools directly into the hands of customers. As always, our teams are constantly learning from the intelligence we collect to continue evolving protections for our infrastructure. We employ a ‘follow the sun’ model where our teams track new threat intelligence 24/7 and are able to quickly respond to issues. Our security teams are sharing this intelligence with governments and IT organizations that we partner closely with from Europe, North America, and around the world to equip critical infrastructure owners and operators with additional information to protect their facilities.While we are seeing an increase in activity of malicious state actors, we are also seeing a higher operational tempo by other malicious actors. We have seen several situations where malware has been specifically targeted at charities, NGOs, and other aid organizations in order to spread confusion and cause disruption. In these particularly egregious cases, malware has been targeted at disrupting medical supplies, food, and clothing relief. We’ll continue to work hard to protect these customers and will continue to work closely with them as they carry out their much-needed work to help those impacted by this terrible conflict.Our public sector teams partner closely with governments to understand their security needs, responding quickly with support and guidance. In the lead up to this conflict, we consulted with the Ukrainian government, nations across the European Union, the European Commission, the U.S. government, NATO, and other organizations. AWS remains committed to providing security expertise and support, as mentioned in Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy’s message on Twitter to the people of Ukraine.Unlike other U.S. technology providers, AWS has no data centers, infrastructure, or offices in Russia, and we have a long-standing policy of not doing business with the Russian government. We have also stopped allowing new sign-ups for AWS in Russia and Belarus. Our biggest customers using AWS in Russia are companies who are headquartered outside of the country and have some development teams there. AWS has clear terms of service where if a customer is using AWS services to threaten, incite, promote, or actively encourage violence, terrorism, or other serious harm, they will not be permitted to use our services. Any customer we know of who is participating in this type of behavior will have their access to AWS suspended.As this conflict continues, AWS and Amazon are actively assisting and will carry on doing so into the future for both the people of Ukraine and around the world. We will continue working to support the relief efforts and to bring our security expertise and services to help to everyone that needs them.We will also continue to share updates and progress on our efforts.Learn more about Amazon's assistance in Ukraine.

Given the ongoing situation in Russia and Ukraine, we’ve taken additional actions in the region. We’ve suspended shipment of retail products to customers based in Russia and Belarus, and we will no longer be accepting new Russia and Belarus-based AWS sign-ups and Amazon third-party sellers. We are also suspending access to Prime Video for customers based in Russia, and we will no longer be taking orders for New World, which is the only video game we sell directly in Russia.As a reminder, unlike some other U.S. technology providers, Amazon and AWS have no data centers, infrastructure, or offices in Russia, and we have a long-standing policy of not doing business with the Russian government.We’re continuing to partner with several NGOs and organizations to support the immense humanitarian needs in the region. Amazon donated $5 million to support those impacted. We continue to match our employees’ donations, and we’re happy to report that over 10,000 employees have donated to the effort. Tens of thousands of customers around the world have also made donations via our homepages, and we’re making sure those funds get to Save the Children and the Red Cross on the ground.Learn more about Amazon's assistance in Ukraine.

Women employees say AWS’s efforts to increase diverse representation are rooted within the company’s culture.

As a 58-year-old lesbian and parent, Meg Columbia-Walsh is intimately familiar with the challenges women can face in their careers due to conscious or unconscious bias. As a sales enablement director with Amazon Web Services (AWS) in New Jersey, she strives to be a role model for other women in a work culture that she says values diversity, intelligence, and innovation.






Meg Columbia-Walsh, sales enablement director at AWS

“We are encouraged to think big, innovate, and earn trust. We cannot do that well with a single strand of experience and thinking, or single demographic,” Columbia-Walsh said. “We can only do that well with a diverse number of qualifications, experiences, and cultures. [Diversity] is limitless in its intellectual contribution.”The women of AWS are increasingly experiencing what’s limitless thanks to an inclusive work environment that runs much deeper than hiring quotas or diversity initiatives. Employee-led affinity groups provide virtual and in-person spaces for connection and belonging while women leaders and mentors prove that working to build the future together starts with everyone getting a seat at the table.“There are countless studies that have shown that the more diverse a workplace is, the more productive and profitable [it becomes],” Columbia-Walsh said. “We cannot claim to be the best if we do not have the inclusion of that diverse thinking and experience. The breadth of the contribution that comes from a diverse workforce—it is a precious commodity.”Empowering our peopleWhen Natalia Valle, a senior business development manager in Seattle for AWS Marketplace, moved into her role about two years ago, she didn’t notice many women. As the daughter of two immigrants—her mother is from Cuba, and her father is from Italy—she also noticed there wasn’t much Latino representation at the time.






Natalia Valle, senior business development manager for AWS Marketplace

“I don’t know if there were any Latin women two years ago, but that’s changed drastically just in the last year and a half,” Valle said.Valle said that as AWS grows, the opportunities to grow diversity across the company are as exciting as they are vast. As she can attest, having moved from non-technical roles at Amazon—a global vendor manager for consumer electronics in retail followed by a senior business development manager for Launchpad in retail—to a technical role at AWS, the work culture and career growth opportunities across the company are perfectly poised to foster that growth.“We have really strong leaders who mentor and teach. Skills can be learned, and it’s important to acknowledge that career paths vary and don’t have to be decided in college or even in your first couple of jobs,” Valle said. “I want to see more women in tech, more Latin women in tech, and more Latinos in general in tech. AWS is working to make that happen, but it also requires the people in the organization to do their part.”



Women in Tech: International Women's Day

Join the Women in Tech conversation to hear more from AWS women around the globe.

That’s why Valle does exactly that. She’s a member of the Inclusion Board at AWS, the Latinos and Women affinity groups, the Seattle chapter of the national organization Girls in Tech, and she volunteers for an internal Amazon program called Candid Chats. She’s involved because she knows how impactful it can be to see people who look like you working in roles you might never have imagined were possible.“We set up a 30-minute coffee chat for candidates so they have the opportunity to talk to somebody in the company who represents their community or background, so they can understand what the work environment could be like for them,” Valle said. “Amazon provides a ton of opportunities for you to advocate for the experiences you’ve had. I wouldn't have been here for as long as I have if I truly didn't believe in the overall mission that we're trying to achieve and the way that we've gone about it.”That authenticity is exactly what inspires Rebekah Kulidzan, a solutions architect on the UK and Ireland Public Sector team, to share about her experiences at AWS. She said the inclusion, diversity, and equity work at AWS is so important because it’s important to everyday life. AWS does a great job ensuring its people never feel alone, she said.






Rebekah Kulidzan, solutions architect at AWS

“AWS’s culture is truly one where you are encouraged to bring your truest self to the table. Diversity of experience and background is seen as a positive, and feedback—no matter how difficult to hear—is cherished,” Kulidzan said. “I feel as though our voices are listened to no matter your tenure, seniority, or role. There is always someone to talk to, learn from, and support you, and you’re encouraged to reach out all the time.”Opening doors for women in techWith a career that has spanned the fields of health care, oil and gas, financial services, and now tech, California-based Lorraine Knerr has seen first-hand the imbalance of women representation in these industries and more. That’s why Knerr—who’s the head of artificial intelligence/machine learning and analytics architecture for AWS’s business development and strategic industries strategic accounts team—is so passionate about mentorship and “offering the hand down.” At AWS, she also feels empowered to amplify the voices of women technologists across the company to show other women that this is a place where they can thrive.






Lorraine Knerr, head of artificial intelligence/machine learning and analytics architecture for AWS business development and strategic industries strategic accounts

“The woman role model is so important—to see what someone has done ahead of you. I love speaking to people about the journey and the art of what’s possible with your career because I’ve had such an unusual journey,” Knerr said. “You don’t need to come out of school with a computer science degree. We have technology and programs that enable you to get those skills, but we also need people with communications and customer skills.”Case in point: Alex Anderson, a Seattle-based executive assistant at AWS who has learned that her background in sales, marketing, operations, and executive support could be a launchpad for a new career in tech. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, she recognized the significance and staying power of technology. Now, she’s taking computer science classes and plans to enter the Amazon Technical Academy, a nine-month upskilling program that helps employees become software engineers. She found out about the program during one of the Women at Amazon affinity group meetings.






Alex Anderson, executive assistant at AWS

“Everything depends on technology now, and I want to be part of the future of helping people take their businesses to the next level,” Anderson said. “One of the reasons I decided to join AWS is because we’re so flexible with career changes. If you do one job and you don’t like it, you can always transition to another job. I see a lot more women in data science, computer science, and software engineering fields now, and Amazon really encourages [making transitions] through programs like the Technical Academy.”A sense of belonging across the globeAt AWS, where all employees are known as builders whether they’re in tech or non-tech roles, the scale and scope of the business often highlights cultural differences around the world. When JuHyeon Song, who heads three business teams for AWS Korea—Digital Native Business, Game, and Independent Software Vendors—attended an AWS leaders conference in 2017, she was nervous about speaking in her non-native English to express her opinions at the meeting. She recalls another director—a woman—calling her by name to kindly and gently give her an opportunity to be heard.






JuHyeon Song, head of three business teams for AWS Korea

“She made me comfortable to speak slowly and asked other Western speakers to be patient and pay attention to me,” Song said. “That was an amazing experience to me and I said to myself, ‘I’ll be a leader like that who’s considerate and inclusive to ensure every voice is heard.’”Song went on to found the Women at Amazon Korea affinity group in 2018 and served as chair. She has been an active board member ever since. The group has evolved to become the Diversity at Amazon Korea affinity group to embrace diversity beyond gender. Song also shares her experiences and insight around other topics, including women in tech, corporate social responsibility, and working moms, across other forums.










AWS Careers: Changing the Conversation

Real innovation comes from bringing more perspectives into the conversation—and making sure every voice is heard. AWS is committed to building a more diverse workforce, and an inclusive culture that lets every individual shine.

“I have often experienced what it’s like being the only woman in the room—that’s why I feel more responsible for helping to grow more woman in tech and leadership,” Song said. “Hence, [I] put the continuous effort to eliminate general stereotypes about women to demonstrate my own unique value.”When the culture across a company encourages and supports these conversations, women not only feel a sense of belonging, they feel empowered. Rishita Acharya, a logistics manager for data center operations in Mumbai, India, said that translates to benefits across the board, from the company to the customer. She said that thanks to AWS’s non-hierarchal structure, leaders are always approachable, your contributions and skills are valued, and work-life harmony is encouraged.






Rishita Acharya, logistics manager for data center operations at AWS

“When employees feel more connected at work, they tend to work harder and smarter, producing higher quality work. I feel it is very important to truly acknowledge and celebrate the strength that inclusion, diversity, and equity brings,” Acharya said. “It not only boosts a company’s reputation and attracts new talent, but it also helps us retain our talent and serve our customers the best. A diverse workforce will have diverse skill sets and experiences that pave the way for larger innovations.”AWS is building a workplace where more people can thrive in order to create technology that works better for everyone.

Amp is launching in limited-access U.S. beta for iOS. Learn how it will enable creators to DJ their own shows for free, with tens of millions of licensed songs.

Amazon just released the limited-access beta version of Amp, a new app that will give you a way to DJ your own live radio shows. Creators can use a catalog of tens of millions of licensed songs from Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group, and a long list of independent music companies, such as Beggars Group, Believe, CD Baby, and PIAS, with more being added every day. Creators can also engage with their community in real time—no subscription, additional hardware, or editing needed.“Radio has always been about music and culture,” said John Ciancutti, vice president of Amp. “But imagine if you were inventing the medium for the first time today. You’d combine what people love about radio—spontaneous talk, new music discovery, diverse personalities, and broad programming—with all that's made possible by today’s technology. You’d make it so anybody with a phone, a voice, and a love for music could make their own show. And that’s exactly what we’re doing. Amp makes it possible for you to grab the mic and run the airwaves. We are creating a new version of radio that will have an infinite dial of shows.”

Amp is creating built-in discovery and notifications, so listeners can find and follow creators and upcoming shows. Hosts can take callers, with control over who speaks and when. They can pre-plan and schedule their shows, and listen to songs in real time with their audiences. In the future, Amp plans to add even more—everything from Alexa integrations to social sharing to innovative new search and discovery features that will connect listeners with the creators delivering the content they are looking for on the dial.We met with Ciancutti ahead of the official beta launch, to learn more about how Amp will work and what makes it unique. Read on for everything you need to know about the limited-access beta of Amp, launching today.






John Ciancutti, vice president of Amp

What opportunity is Amp building for creators?With Amp, we’re building a new way for you to create a live radio show. Amp infuses what listeners love about radio with what’s made possible by today’s technology. People are looking for an evolution in how they discover and share music; Amp is reinventing how fans can go deeper into the experience of live audio, while giving the millions of people creating and sharing playlists today a new way to turn their love of music into live shows.

Introducing Amp, live radio from Amazon







Why is Amp launching with limited access and only available to those with an access code?Amp is still in the works. We decided to launch in beta because we believe that in order to serve communities of creators at all levels, we need to be in dialogue with them. We need them using the app and telling us what features they want. This limited-access beta will allow us to partner with passionate early adopters in a diverse community of creators, so we can improve the experience and better serve everyone when the app officially launches.What challenges does Amp solve for creators?How would you build your own radio show if there were no satellite towers or recording studios required, no licensing deals to negotiate, and the tools you needed were already on your phone? Amp is bringing music culture and digital music together. A person with their own unique music taste doesn’t have to land a job at a radio station to reach an audience. They just need to launch a show from their phone on Amp and reach anyone. Starting today, people will be able to see the creation of this new live audio experience being built in real time, right in front of their eyes.From your perspective, how does Amp reimagine radio?When I was a kid, radio was really different from how it is today. DJs were local to their markets. I used to move back and forth from San Francisco to Miami between parents, and radio sounded completely different in each city. Not the music, but the sound, everything. DJs would play local music and emerging artists, they were kingmakers, and they drove local music culture. I felt a connection to those DJs. Of course, they didn't know who I was; I was just one of their listeners. But with Amp, that relationship can go both ways. I’m excited for Amp to bring that opportunity to listeners. This beta launch allows us to create that opportunity. It’s not easy to build a brand-new community of creators from scratch, which is why we are so excited to have so many big names joining us on this development process.







How do you create a show on Amp?We are designing Amp to be easy for anyone to use—with everything needed to easily set up a show and go live, built into the app. As a creator, you can host your own show, play hits or deep cuts, talk sports, riff on pop culture, and curate your own playlists with like-minded listeners. The experience and user interface are really intuitive—you can go from launching the app to creating a new show in seconds.How is Amp different from social audio apps or music streaming services?Our starting place for Amp is radio, which means the experience centers on the ability to use a fully licensed catalog of music. We think there are infinite opportunities with live audio technology—and what is currently out there has not even scratched the surface. Amp is bringing the cultural experience into live audio, by creating a space for shows that are curated by people.







What support is Amp offering new creators?The Amp website is where creators and their listeners can get up-to-date information and live support. This includes everything from how to go live and how to optimize your content for Amp, to being notified of upcoming creator programs and how to take part in them. Our team will also be identifying shows to feature and promote across our marketing channels to help our creators find new audiences.How is Amazon working with artists on Amp?Artists have really responded to what they can do with Amp. They want to run shows, play new music, and share the songs that have influenced them—they’ve also talked about using Amp as a way to get their fans to start creating, too.How will Amazon handle violations and protect user safety?Customer trust and safety has been a priority since day one. When I joined Amazon, there was a small team already working on Amp, and the leader of our Trust and Safety team was one of them. With the beginning of the public beta, we have comprehensive community guidelines that are centered on safety and trust. Listeners and creators can report perceived violations of these guidelines either directly from a show or from the app, and we have a 24/7 moderation team that reviews the reports and takes actions in real time. Protecting listeners and creators has been top-of-mind since the beginning, and we want to make sure we get it right. Here is the bottom line: The app and our moderation team have established an open line of communication with our users, so we can hear about issues and take action when needed.What are you listening to on the app?One of my favorite shows on Amp is called CRIOYO Radio. It's run by a creator named Daniel who plays all kinds of Latin music. He runs the show out of New York, but his roots are in Latin America and the Caribbean, so he understands the music incredibly well. I love listening because I learn a lot about the music. I also call in to the show frequently. We talk about the music that he's playing, but we also talk about its origins. We've talked about everything from great food to where I should travel. These conversations have deepened my relationship with him as a creator and have strengthened the sense of community I experience as a listener of the show.







FAQsHow can you get access to the beta version of Amp and when will it be available to more creators? People can get access to the beta version by downloading Amp from the U.S. iOS App Store and signing up for the waitlist, or by subscribing to the Amp Newsletter. People can also follow the @onamp_ social accounts on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, where we’ll be regularly dropping codes to join the app. Do you need an Amazon account to access Amp?Yes, users must use or create a free Amazon account as their login credentials for Amp.

Learn how two sisters use Alexa to make life easier after a Sjogren’s syndrome diagnosis.

Autoimmune diseases affect more than 24 million Americans, according to National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Receiving a diagnosis of an autoimmune disease can often mean the beginning of a lifelong process of learning to adapt and change: new medication schedules, lifestyle changes, and shifts in the way someone interacts with the people and environments around them.Grace was in her mid-20s when she was diagnosed with Sjogren’s syndrome, an autoimmune disease that can cause chronic pain, fatigue, and other serious complications. Her sister Emma, an Amazon employee, wanted to help Grace however she could, so she turned to Alexa to help find some solutions.






Grace enjoying the outdoors with her dog.

In Emma’s words:Out of the blue one year, my sister, Grace, was diagnosed with Sjogren’s syndrome. Sjogren’s is a condition that manifests in many different ways, but the one that affected Grace the most was the impact it had on her mobility.Today, she has trouble maintaining balance without keeping her eyes on her hands and feet, so getting around her house, especially at night, has become really difficult. It felt like overnight she went from being a young, active park ranger, to needing a little extra support from us all, and I became really interested in exploring how I could best help.






Emma and Grace celebrating the holidays together.

Our journey with Alexa started because I was looking for a way to help Grace turn on the light beside her bed in the middle of the night. She told me that she was waking her husband every time she wanted to get up, and she found it frustrating to need that help. I thought it’d be cool if she could find a way to do it herself without needing to rely on her vision. I did some research, and it led me to Alexa. That year, I gave her an Echo Dot and some smart plugs and smart light bulbs to go along with it.Now, our entire family has Echo devices in our homes. We all frequently use the Drop In feature, not only to check in on Grace, but also to stay in touch with one another. If Grace needs assistance while she’s home alone, she can call out to one of us and know that we can come and help.I personally love the Echo devices, because not only are they really helpful in assisting my sister in keeping her home more accessible and safe, but they also have a lot of fun elements, like being able to listen to music and get the news just by asking Alexa. Alexa has given my sister the support she needs as she adjusts and learns to trust her own capabilities again.Learn more about how you can use Alexa to connect with and look out for your loved ones, or explore how to set up smart devices to move more freely around your home, hands-free.

Since March 29, more than 14,000 doses have been administered at this location.Amazon has also been providing surge support to the Washington State Department of Health’s 2-1-1 call center amid a spike in COVID-19 questions. The center was overloaded with wait times of up to an hour and a backlog of 4,500 voicemails until a new system using Amazon volunteers and Amazon Connect technology was launched in March. The center has since processed over 100,000 calls. The center also eliminated wait times by immediately connecting callers to a response system that uses the same natural language-understanding technology that powers Alexa.April 20Alexa can help customers access information about COVID-19 vaccines and connect them to vaccination sitesAs vaccine eligibility opens up nationally, Alexa can help customers find and connect with nearby vaccination sites. Customers can just ask, “Alexa, where can I get a COVID vaccine?” or say, “Alexa, where can I get a COVID vaccine in Seattle?” to hear a list of locations close to you. Additionally, customers can say, “Alexa, call the first one,” (or second, or third location) to connect to a specific location directly and learn more about vaccine or appointment availability. Learn more about how Alexa is helping customers with COVID-19 testing and vaccine questions.April 14Vaccination means healing, hope, and protection for this Amazon employeeAfter receiving his first shot of the COVID-19 vaccination, Philip Cosand, an Amazon Go Grocery employee in Seattle, was inspired to email Amazon's COVID-19 volunteer vaccination team. We, in turn, were inspired by Cosand’s sentiment, and asked to share his email. Read his message here.April 12Amazon Web Services to distribute $12 million in 2021 to fight COVID-19In the first phase of its Diagnostic Development Initiative, AWS helped 87 organizations in 17 countries ranging from nonprofits and research institutions to startups and large businesses. AWS awarded $8 million to support a range of diagnostic projects, including molecular tests for antibodies, antigens, and nucleic acids; diagnostic imaging; wearables; and data analytics tools that use artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect the virus. As we launch the next phase, AWS will broaden the AWS Diagnostic Development Initiative’s scope to three new areas: 1) early disease detection to identify outbreaks at the individual and at the community level; 2) prognosis to better understand disease trajectory; and 3) public health genomics to bolster viral genome sequencing worldwide. Read more.March 30Amazon updates return to office guidanceToday, we shared this update with our teams globally:Many of you have been asking for some guidance around returning to the office, so you can better plan the next several months (including school plans for those with kids). We wanted to share our thinking and provide an update beyond the June 30 guidance we’ve provided to date.Our plan is to return to an office-centric culture as our baseline. We believe it enables us to invent, collaborate, and learn together most effectively.The timelines for returning to the office will vary by country, depending on the infection and vaccination rates, and we expect our return to the office to be gradual. In many parts of Asia, our employees are already back in the office. In the U.S., as vaccines become broadly available in the next few months, we expect more people will start coming into the office through the summer, with most back in the office by early fall. In some countries in Europe, we expect in-person working to take longer given recent setbacks. As we get closer to the summer, we’ll develop more country-specific plans and post all updates to Inside Amazon under Local News. As a reminder, Amazon offices remain open and about 10% of our corporate population currently works from an office each day.

Improving the COVID-19 patient experience COVID-19 patients are often cut off from visitors, making it challenging to keep family members up-to-date on the health of their loved ones and leaving patients feeling isolated. AWS customers have stepped in to offer solutions, EASE Applications sends HIPAA-compliant text updates to families from the emergency room, operating room, intensive care unit, and medical floor. During the COVID-19 crisis, the company is using Amazon Chime SDK to incorporate two-way video communication into its mobile apps so that families of COVID-19 patients have reliable, remote communication with the patients and their doctors. CareMonitor, a provider of remote health monitoring, expanded its platform to monitor the daily health status of COVID-19 patients with low-level symptoms so they can recover from the virus in their own homes. In the CareMonitor app, patients are asked daily symptom questions and collect biometric data like temperature, heart rate and oxygen saturation to gauge their current health status.

Full story.March 18Donating $1 million to support emergency response efforts in Washington, D.C.Amazon has donated $1 million to kick-start emergency COVID-19 response efforts in the Washington D.C. area. The funds will benefit the four largest foundations supporting vulnerable populations impacted amid the pandemic—including hourly workers, people experiencing homelessness, and the elderly. Amazon is also providing cash and in-kind support to five food service providers in the region. Full story.Adjusting grocery store hours to help the most vulnerableWhole Foods Market is temporarily adjusting store hours to accommodate those most vulnerable to COVID-19. Customers who are age 60 and over in the U.S. and Canada, and age 70 and over in the UK, are invited to shop beginning one hour before the store opens to the general public under the new adjusted hours. We are setting aside this time to help these customers feel more comfortable shopping at our stores and get needed items in a less crowded environment.Ongoing, enhanced cleaning in our physical storesTo help protect customers shopping in our physical retail stores, we've enhanced our daily cleaning procedures and are implementing additional nightly cleanings. We continue to educate employees on CDC guidance for maintaining healthy habits and are offering flexibility for employees who need to stay home, plus paid time off for those who are diagnosed with the virus.March 17Prioritizing essential items in our Operations networkAs COVID-19 continues to spread, online shopping has increased, particularly for essential goods. To address this need and help ensure the safety of our associates, we've adjusted our logistics, transportation, supply chain, purchasing, and third-party seller processes to prioritize stocking and delivering higher-priority items. This will result in some of our delivery promises being longer than usual.Customers can help others through No-Rush ShippingWhile customers can continue to buy any in-stock product in our store, those ordering non-essential items can help others by choosing No-Rush Shipping when available. Selecting the No-Rush option helps us serve customers with the most critical needs first because we can consolidate more orders and make fewer stops in neighborhoods throughout the week.March 16Hiring 100,000 people to help meet demand and support existing employeesWe're hiring 100,000 new full and part-time employees across the U.S. in our fulfillment centers and delivery network to meet the surge in demand from people relying on Amazon's services during this stressful time. We encourage people across the hospitality, restaurant, and travel industries who have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis to work with us until their previous employer can hire them back. Learn more.Increasing pay in the U.S., UK, Canada, and many EU countriesOur employees in fulfillment centers, transportation operations, stores or those making deliveries are playing an essential role for customers during this crisis. We are recognizing this amazing work with pay increases. Qualifying employees will receive an additional $2 USD per hour in the U.S., C$2 per hour in Canada, £2 per hour in the UK, and approximately €2 per hour in many EU countries. Update April 24: We’ve extended the increased hourly pay outlined below through May 16. We are also extending double overtime pay in the U.S. and Canada. These extensions increase our total investment in pay during COVID-19 to nearly $700 million for our hourly employees and partners. In addition, we are providing flexibility with leave of absence options, including expanding the policy to cover COVID-19 circumstances, such as high-risk individuals or school closures. We continue to see heavy demand during this difficult time and the team is doing incredible work for our customers and the community. Read more about how we’re taking care of employees. March 15Customers can select unattended delivery optionsCustomers ordering delivery from Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, and Whole Foods Market have the option to select ""unattended delivery"" during checkout if they prefer not to come into contact with their delivery driver. Customers can specify the drop-off location as part of the check-out process as well. Orders not containing alcohol are eligible for unattended delivery.Providing teachers and students with online STEM coursesStarting today, the Amazon Future Engineer program will provide free access to computer science courses for students and teachers in the United States. These courses are for independent learners from 6th to 12th grade or teachers working remotely with this age group. Find this content and more on the Amazon Future Engineer website.March 11Establishing the $25 million Amazon Relief FundWe've established a $25 million Amazon Relief Fund to support our independent delivery service partners and their drivers, Amazon Flex participants, and seasonal employees under financial distress during the pandemic. All of these groups can apply for grants equaling up to two weeks of pay if diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed into quarantine. Read more.Supporting employees affected by COVID with paid time offAll Amazon employees diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed into quarantine will receive up to two weeks of pay. This ensures employees have the time they need to return to good health without the worry of lost income. This is in addition to unlimited unpaid time off for all hourly employees through the end of April. Full story.March 10New $5 million fund for small businesses in Amazon's Seattle neighborhoodWe created a $5 million Neighborhood Small Business Relief Fund to help Seattle-area small businesses during this economically challenging time. The fund will support businesses with fewer than 50 employees or less than $7 million in annual revenue. To qualify for a grant, businesses should have a physical presence within a few blocks of Amazon's Regrade or South Lake Union offices, be open to the general public, and rely on foot traffic for customers. Additionally, we are subsidizing two full months of rent for tenants in Amazon-owned buildings. Full story.March 9Amazon donates $1 million to COVID-19 Response FundWe've contributed $1 million to a COVID-19 Response Fund to rapidly deploy resources to community-based organizations at the front lines of the Puget Sound region's COVID-19 outbreak. The fund, which is hosted by the Seattle Foundation, will provide flexible resources to nonprofits and community-based organizations working with those disproportionately affected by the pandemic and the economic consequences of the outbreak. Initial grants will support organizations helping those without sick leave or health insurance, medically fragile individuals, and healthcare workers. Full story.March 6Amazon employees recommended to work from homeIn light of ongoing international COVID-19 developments, we now recommend all employees who can work from home to do so.

A collaboration with top organizations will support an estimated 54,000 supply chain workers and small business artisans across Asia.

Building on Amazon's continued commitment to global workers in its supply chain, the company is funding new tools and collaborating with several organizations to help an estimated 54,000 factory supply chain workers in Asia mitigate the longterm impacts of COVID-19.The commitment will specifically support workers in Bangladesh and Vietnam by facilitating vaccine assistance, providing a medical hotline for workers, conducting COVID-19 awareness training, and assisting factories in establishing crisis response plans. It includes a collaboration with Catalyst Management Services (CMS), a social investment specialist group; PATH, a global public health nonprofit; and NEST, a nonprofit supporting artisans around the world.“We’re deeply committed to supporting and building resiliency in our supply chain, while helping ensure the dignity and human rights of workers everywhere in the world where we operate,” said LeighAnne DeWine, head of Social Responsibility at Amazon. “It’s important that we help supply chain workers in Asia’s most COVID-vulnerable regions get access to the crisis response resources they need and help small businesses weather the economic impacts. This commitment is fundamental to who we are as a company and member of the global community.”Millions of workers worldwide remain impacted by deepening poverty, inequality, and job uncertainty due to the lingering impacts of the pandemic. In many parts of Asia, which are critical manufacturing and sourcing regions for Amazon’s goods, workers continue to experience health and financial challenges due to low vaccination rates and reoccurring lockdowns, which can shutter factories.

Amazon’s work with CMS will cover 14 factories and more than 41,000 workers in Bangladesh. The work will focus on facilitating vaccine assistance, including registration support and vaccine access through the national government, follow-up support for workers, and helping factories establish long-term risk mitigation procedures to deal with COVID-19.“Investing in the wellbeing of the workforce is essential, ethical, and in businesses’ best interest,” said Shiv Kumar, co-founder of CMS. “We’re excited to work with Amazon in Bangladesh to design and implement programs to build resilience against COVID-19 and related adversities for workers in the Amazon supply chain.”In Vietnam, PATH’s work is expected to support 13 factories and about 13,000 workers. The efforts will focus on COVID-19 awareness training, assisting factories in establishing crisis response plans, and conducting worker health screenings for the early detection of mental health and general health issues, and occupational diseases.“Through our collaboration with Amazon, PATH hopes to prepare factory workers to proactively respond to health crises, minimize impacts to productivity, and help workers quickly return to normal conditions,” said PATH’s Global Health Security and Malaria Program Director in Southeast Asia Dr. Nhu Nguyen.Additionally, Amazon’s collaboration with NEST will provide tools and training to help more than 70 artisan small business owners in Indonesia, Cambodia, and the Philippines weather the financial impact of shop closures, staffing shortages, and cancelled orders. This builds on the Amazon's previous commitment to NEST, which is providing more than 250,000 global artisans with training to sell their goods to millions of Amazon customers on Amazon Handmade.“Amazon's support will help thousands of artisans in Asia, as well as more than 1,600 small businesses—across 120 countries in the Nest Guild—that will also receive digital training,” said Nest Founder and Executive Director Rebecca van Bergen.Amazon has extended several million dollars to support supply chain and global worker investments related to COVID-19, including a grant in 2020 to provide help for front-line workers. This included support for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Bangladesh to distribute medical supplies and COVID-19-related resources for front-line doctors, nurses, and medical workers operating in the largest refugee camp in the world.The contribution supported the procurement of lifesaving PPE—approximately 322,000 gloves, 16,000 gowns and coveralls, 18,300 N95 respirators, and 119,000 face shields—for 23 IOM-managed health facilities, serving to benefit both refugee and host community populations in the region.Amazon has invested significant funds to support relief for its vast employee network and partners, including delivery drivers and seasonal associates facing financial hardship or quarantine. The company has also hosted more than 1,800 on-site vaccination events for front-line employees since the start of the pandemic.Learn more about Amazon’s broader efforts to support its global workforce and value chain.

Both Squire and Howard University build on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Squire built its platform that combines appointment booking, payroll, and point-of-sale systems—which barbers and owners previously pieced together themselves—using AWS technology. Squire simplifies shop operations, so barbers can focus on their customers. Howard created its Master’s program in collaboration with AWS. It also runs its Howard Entertainment program with Amazon Studios. Both programs are helping create a pipeline of highly skilled African-American candidates to diversify the tech and entertainment industries.

Unistellar is making stargazing more accessible to people worldwide with its unique digital telescopes and growing citizen science network, powered by Amazon Web Services.

“We want people to be able to participate in space exploration, even if they don’t know anything about the sky,” said Arnaud Malvache, co-founder and chief technology officer of Unistellar, a startup and Amazon Web Services (AWS) customer that wants to open up the “sometimes secret-feeling world” of astronomy.Unistellar, which has one foot in Marseille, France and the other in Silicon Valley, has created a series of easy-to-use digital telescopes that marry traditional astronomy with tech. Its lightweight, connected devices allow thousands of people with no prior knowledge of galaxies—or understanding of the equipment normally needed to observe them—to experience breathtaking views of the night skies, and to support scientific research by sharing their data via the AWS cloud.

Using the Unistellar app as a remote control, even when offline, users can direct their telescope to specific points in the sky.“You can click on what we call a recommended ‘object’ in the app, and the telescope will automatically focus on it,” said Malvache. “The app might, for example, suggest something that is ‘appearing soon,’ or ‘fading soon.’ It's actually the coolest feature from most users’ points of view. “In traditional telescopes, the sensor is your eye and the processor is your brain,” he added. “In our telescopes, the sensor is a camera and the processor is an embedded computer. The eye and the brain are amazing, but they’re not optimized for observing the sky at low light. We use a low-light sensor to provide up to 100 times more light through the eyepiece, to deliver incredibly clear images. We also remove light pollution, meaning you can pull your telescope out of your backpack in a downtown district and stargaze without having to go a remote place. Or hide in an attic.”Taking astronomy out of the attic and making it accessible to people all over the world is exactly what Malvache and Unistellar co-founders Laurent Marfisi, Antonin Borot, and Franck Marchis have been on a mission to do ever since they launched their signature telescope, the eVscope, on Kickstarter in 2017.







Initially, they experienced suspicion from astronomers, many of whom didn’t think it was a “proper” telescope, but rather a digital camera that was somehow circumventing the traditional way of viewing the galaxy.“A lot of people, including some of my colleagues, thought that I was wasting my time,” said Marchis, who, in addition to being Unistellar’s chief scientific officer, serves as senior planetary astronomer at the SETI Institute in California, a nonprofit dedicated to exploring the origins of life in the universe.“Suddenly, I was giving up on this golden access to big telescopes to work on these tiny devices, which were, in their eyes, not capable of doing much,” he continued. “Now they’ve changed their minds. They all want an eVscope.”







Early skeptics aside, Unistellar’s initial popularity surprised even its founders. Expecting to move a few hundred units with their first Kickstarter outing, they sold almost 2,000.“In 2021, we went from storing 5.7 million uploaded images to 27.7 million,” said Malvache, who credits AWS storage and compute services with Unistellar’s ability to grow at such rapid pace.The company now has more than 7,000 customers, largely across North America, Europe, and Japan—part of what Marchis describes as the “biggest connected network of telescopes in the world.”“We almost have a full cover range of Earth,” he said. “We’re continuously monitoring specific targets such as asteroids, comets, and exoplanets—planets orbiting stars outside of our solar system. If something happens in the sky right now, I can send a message to our network and someone will start observing it.”






The Unistellear Global Network of Citizen Astronomers 

The network Marchis refers to is the Unistellar community of citizen astronomers, who use their eVscopes to record images and gather data on astronomical events, and share it on the cloud with research institutions like NASA and SETI.“We store the data on AWS, then we analyze the quality,” said Malvache. “‘Was the user pointing the telescope in the right direction?’ ‘Were there any clouds?’ And so on. We do a first analysis of the scientific results on AWS as soon as we receive the data and we give the user a report as quickly as possible. Our users want fast feedback and it encourages them to participate again. The cloud allows us to do this. That's why AWS is really convenient for us.”







Last year, these citizen scientists were invited to take part in more than 800 campaigns organized by Unistellar, helping NASA and SETI to fill some of the gaps in their research.“We have thousands of telescopes working at the same time, in different locations,” said Malvache. “It means we can see an event from different angles. So, for an asteroid, we can get a sense of its shape, because we’re not only observing it from one vantage point.”In addition to supporting scientists, Unistellar is putting eVscopes in the hands of a new generation of astronomers. Both the Girl Scouts and U.S. community colleges have bought eVscopes—with the Girl Scouts now offering badges in astronomy, and several community colleges using eVscopes to integrate astronomy into the curriculum.

“Our users are already extremely diverse in terms of gender and nationalities,” said Marchis. “I’d say our greatest achievements so far have been making it easier for people to participate in science and observations, and growing the community of citizen astronomers in different countries. And we want to do more.”Although the eVscope is more powerful and easier to use than most traditional telescopes, it’s not yet at a price point that makes it accessible to as many people as its creators would like. But as with the smartphone before it, Unistellar hopes to make the eVscope more affordable as it grows, and ultimately sell it in countries that have historically had limited access to stargazing equipment.A recent partnership on lenses with camera company Nikon could be a “game changer” in this respect, according to Malvache.“We have the goal of going to really high volumes in the consumer market,” he said. “Nikon has the experience to help us do that.”“We will have our first eVscope customer in Kenya soon,” added Marchis. “My dream is that one day we will have our telescopes across sub-Saharan Africa. This new astronomy really is an astronomy for everybody.”

AWS's new tool makes it easy for customers to monitor, analyze, and reduce their carbon footprint.

As the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is committed to building a sustainable business for our customers and the planet. A new way AWS is fulfilling this commitment is by launching the customer carbon footprint tool, which shows customers how AWS helps to reduce their carbon footprint, compared to on-premises solutions. AWS developed the customer carbon footprint tool to support customers on their sustainability journey.This new tool uses easy-to-understand visualizations to show customers their historical carbon emissions, evaluate emission trends as their use of AWS evolves, estimate the carbon emissions they have avoided by using AWS instead of an on-premises data center, and review forecasted emissions based on their current use. The forecast shows how customers’ footprints will change as Amazon stays on path to powering its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of its original target of 2030, and drives toward net-zero carbon by 2040.“As we continue to fulfill our commitment to The Climate Pledge and work toward net-zero carbon emissions, we want to give our customers the data they need to measure their carbon footprint and meet their own carbon reduction goals,” said Nat Sahlstrom, director of Amazon Energy. “The customer carbon footprint tool makes carbon emissions information easy for customers to work with and encourages companies to accelerate their goals, plans, and programs to address the urgency of climate change.”The launch of the customer carbon footprint tool is part of Amazon’s commitment to The Climate Pledge. Amazon co-founded the Pledge in 2019, becoming the first signatory and setting a goal to meet the Paris Agreement 10 years early—and achieve net-zero carbon by 2040. Signatories to the Pledge agree to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis, and the new AWS tool allows customers to do this, by providing the emissions data and enabling them to easily incorporate it into their annual reporting.










The Climate Pledge announces 86 new signatories

More than 200 global businesses, including three new signatories in India, have now joined The Climate Pledge and are pursuing ambitious carbon-reduction activities, including mobilizing their supply chains to tackle climate change.

How the carbon footprint tool worksAWS customers migrate workloads from on-premises data centers to AWS for many reasons, from saving money and accelerating innovation, to making their operations more sustainable. In many cases, moving to AWS is more sustainable than supporting on-premises solutions. According to 451 Research, when compared to surveyed enterprise data centers across several geographic regions, AWS can lower a customer’s carbon footprint by nearly 80% today and up to 96% once AWS is powered with 100% renewable energy, by 2025.With the new tool, customers who have set carbon reduction goals can more accurately measure the emissions associated with their use of AWS. The customer carbon footprint tool reports on customers’ corporate emissions, which include their use of AWS, and provides data to show progress toward future reduction targets.







In addition, historical carbon emissions data is available based on the customer’s AWS use from January 2020 onward. It includes Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Scope 1 emissions come directly from a company’s operations, such as the energy consumed by AWS data centers, while Scope 2 emissions come from the generation of purchased energy, like the electricity used to power Amazon facilities.The tool’s carbon unit of measurement is metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e), an industry-standard. It is “equivalent” because there are multiple greenhouse gases (for example, they include methane and nitrous oxide), and the measurement converts the greenhouse gases to the amount of carbon that would cause equivalent warming. The customer carbon footprint tool is shared through the AWS Billing console and uses carbon data that meets the widely adopted international standard of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which supplies the world's most widely used greenhouse gas accounting standards. When signed into the AWS Billing console, customers can view their carbon emissions data by geographical location and by AWS services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). They can also measure changes in their carbon footprint over time, as they deploy new resources in the cloud.How customers use the toolAWS worked with a range of customers to test and develop the customer carbon footprint tool, including Pinterest, Turbonomic, Veolia, Workday, and Salesforce.The data that AWS provides to Salesforce helps the company understand its climate impacts and enables them to develop plans to avoid, reduce, and compensate for emissions. Salesforce is a signatory of The Climate Pledge and joined Amazon in being a founding member of the LEAF Coalition, which recently reached its goal of $1 billion in public-private finance to protect tropical forests around the world.“Improved AWS carbon footprint data helps us develop better strategies and take better action to avoid and reduce emissions. I’m glad that AWS is providing more and more data about our usage and offering the same tools to all customers,” said Patrick Flynn, senior vice president and global head of sustainability at Salesforce. “We look forward to seeing the carbon intensity associated with our use of AWS services decrease as we continue to innovate together and as AWS continues to make progress towards their renewable energy and net-zero carbon commitments.”

Salesforce Senior VP of Sustainability Patrick Flynn on Collaborating with AWS | Amazon Web Services







Pinterest’s Workplace Sustainability Manager Mia Ketterling also highlighted the benefits of the carbon footprint tool, “Having a clear understanding of where your sources of emissions come from is key for any company to build their reduction plan. We are excited to use the customer carbon footprint tool to help us understand our footprint, reduce the impact of our operations, and create a sustainability program that is uniquely Pinterest.”The carbon footprint tool joins a collection of other AWS tools, including the AWS Well-Architected Sustainability Pillar and AWS Compute Optimizer, that help customers improve performance, reduce costs, and minimize environmental footprint.Learn more about the customer carbon footprint tool.

AWS analytics and machine learning power new “Set Piece Threat” and “Skill” Match Facts that give fans insights into Germany’s top football league.

The 2022 Bundesliga season is underway, and football fans around the world have access to two new Bundesliga Match Facts powered by AWS. Match Facts are a set of in-game advanced statistics using real-time data to quantify the action on the pitch. They offer insights into a team’s playing strategy and defining moments during a game, giving fans an enhanced viewing experience through rich storytelling.“Set Piece Threat” delivers new perspective on a team’s scoring ability from plays like free kicks and corner kicks, while “Skill” compares and characterizes Bundesliga players to quantify the skills they bring to their teams and positions.










NHL unveils first AI-powered stat to predict face-off winner before puck is dropped

Introducing Face-off Probability, a first-of-its-kind artificial intelligence (AI) tool powered by AWS, built by analyzing over 200,000 face-offs combined with 10 years of historical player data.

With these additions, there is now a portfolio of 10 Bundesliga Match Facts powered by AWS to help fans better understand factors like the strategy involved in decision making on the pitch and the probability of a goal for each shot. The league generates the Match Facts by gathering and analyzing data from live game camera feeds as they’re streamed into AWS. From there, Bundesliga uses AWS capabilities in analytics, machine learning, compute, storage, database, serverless, and media services to glean insights and generate predictions. AWS and Bundesliga then train, deploy, and scale the machine learning models used to generate them and deliver them as on-screen graphics during broadcasts and in the official Bundesliga app. Fans, coaches, players, and commentators can use them as visual support for analyzing a team’s decision making.“The pace of the players, the action on the pitch—Fußball is nonstop action. Brilliant plays can happen in a blink of an eye. We created the Bundesliga Match Facts powered by AWS to enrich the match experience for millions of fans worldwide, with real-time insights that deepen the viewer’s knowledge and appreciation of the sport and player actions,” said Andreas Heyden, executive vice president of digital innovations for DFL Deutsche Fußball Liga. “Together with AWS, we’re adding a whole new dimension to the sport, with innovative in-game perspectives that give context on game strategy to help redefine how the world watches football.”Understanding the new Bundesliga Match Facts powered by AWSSet Piece Threat


































In modern football, teams score more than a quarter of all goals from set pieces like free kicks and corner kicks. Until now, fans had no reliable way of assessing the threat a team poses from different types of set pieces. “Set Piece Threat” quantifies a team’s threat by comparing the team to the league average. Bundesliga computes threat values for offense and defense situations to show how much of a threat a team is with their set pieces. During live broadcast games, video editors can use “Set Piece Threat” ahead of free kicks and corner kicks to show how much more danger exists in the current matchup compared to the league average or whenever match commentators want to talk about set pieces and the related strength of a team.Skill 







In addition to their exceptional fundamental talent, every player in the Bundesliga brings some specialized skills to the game that complement those of their fellow players and make their team stronger. The new “Skill” Match Fact combines and compares the cumulative stats of every Bundesliga player to assess their skills across different categories. The stat features four player profiles: a “Finisher” who excels at scoring goals (both the number and efficiency); a “Sprinter” who generates high maximum speed and can get farther on the field than other players; an “Initiator” who accumulates, assists, and makes a high number of difficult passes that lead to assists; and a “Ball Winner” who is able to create a lot of turnovers from the opposing team by winning the ball in a duel or intercepting an opponent’s pass. Bundesliga ranks each skill by combining several metrics into one score. If a player ranks in the league-wide Top 10 for a given skill, Bundesliga will highlight this player in the live broadcast or in the Bundesliga app when substitutions are shown.Find more information on Match Facts statistics.

Introducing Face-off Probability, a first-of-its-kind artificial intelligence (AI) tool powered by AWS, built by analyzing over 200,000 face-offs combined with 10 years of historical player data.

A face-off can be one of the most pivotal moments in a hockey game. The winning player can swing the momentum to their team and directly impact the game’s outcome. Imagine, it’s late in the third period of a close game, and two hockey players are face to face on the ice, waiting for the puck to drop. Everyone is guessing who will get to the puck first. But until now, no one had a comprehensive way to assess who was more likely to win. To close this gap, the National Hockey League (NHL) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) developed Face-off Probability, which uses AI to deliver real-time face-off predictions to analysts, fans, and teams. This is a significant technology development because it’s the first probability stat from AWS that will be seen live before the play, instead of as it happens. During a stoppage in play, Face-off Probability generates predictions for who will win the upcoming face-off based on the players on the ice, location of the face-off, and current game situation. The predictions occur in less than a second and are generated throughout the stoppage until the game clock starts running again. The teams working to tackle the challenge of producing real-time face-off predictions had to build this playbook from scratch. But AWS was uniquely positioned to generate a solution given its record of building data-driven solutions for sports and its deep technology partnership with the NHL, which already produced shot and save analytics in 2021. 







Applying AWS machine learning (ML) to NHL data Building an entirely new system from scratch that can proactively evaluate face-off matchups and predict winners posed significant technical challenges. The NHL and AWS used Player, Puck, and Tracking (PPT) data, and hundreds of thousands of face-offs from over 10 years of historical NHL Hockey Information & Tracking System (HITS) stats. This data source was incredibly varied and complex. It needed to incorporate information like individual historical home and away face-off statistics; head-to-head matchup history; player characteristics such as height, weight, and handedness; and game context such as the location of the face-off, score of the game, and time of the face-off occurring. This combination of historical success rates, player matchup characteristics, and game context brings together HITS and PPT data to provide a complete and unique perspective of face-off dynamics. 










AWS’s inclusive culture inspires individuality and acceptance

During Black History Month, Black professionals reflect on positive experiences at AWS.




Read more
















Adjusting for new face-off matchups Face-off Probability is also flexible, adapting predictions based on changes to the game situation. For example, if a player is waived out of the face-off due to a violation, the model updates the prediction to the new matchup based on the real-time PPT streaming sensor data coming from the rink and from sensors attached to the players. Predictions occur in less than a second and are triggered when there’s a change in players involved in the face-off. A prediction can also show the change in a team’s probability of winning a face-off when the primary center person is waived out of the face-off and replaced with a player with a different probability of success. This highlights the importance of having a particular player in the face-off circle. In addition to providing the probability of the two players facing off, the tool also provides other likely face-off combination pairings that will aid broadcast teams in highlighting potential matchups, which will enrich the viewing experience for fans. Learn more about Face-off Probability, other analytics, and how AWS is transforming the hockey industry with the NHL.

Like many of you around the world, we’re watching what’s happening in Ukraine with horror, concern, and heavy hearts. While we have no direct operations in Ukraine, we have employees and partners who are from or have a deep connection to the country.Over the past several days, we’ve worked across Amazon to understand how we can best help those who are affected by the violence. It’s difficult for any company without a local presence to provide direct support in a war zone, so we’re donating $5 million to organizations that are providing critical support on the ground, including UNICEF, UNHCR, World Food Program, Red Cross, Polska Akcja Humanitarna, and Save the Children.We’ve also heard from employees that they want to help, so we’re matching up to $5 million in additional donations from our team to those organizations. For customers who want to help, we’re adding donation buttons or direct links to charitable organizations on the homepages of our websites, and will waive our fees for payment processing on donations made through Amazon.In addition to providing financial support for relief efforts on the ground in Ukraine, we’re also working to support our teams and Ukrainian immigrants in other ways. For example, we gave employees in Poland additional time off to take care of themselves and their families, and we’re working with Ukrainian nationals to expedite immigration work visas if they’ve relocated.The recovery from the war will take many years, and we’ll continue working with NGOs, our employees, and our partners to support the relief efforts and those affected.Learn more about Amazon's assistance in Ukraine.

Meet Debo-san, who pursues his passion and preserves tradition in Hokkaido, the remote and northernmost island of Japan’s four main islands.

Convenience has often been a lens we use to choose where we reside. Convenience to get what we want, when we want it, is a benefit of residing in big cities and towns. What if we were able to get whatever we need, and get a chance to stay where we want, to pursue our true passion?Hideo Akibe—also known as Debo—is a member of the Ainu community was born and raised in the remote Akan National Park region of Hokkaido, Japan. As a proud member of the Ainu community, Debo tries to keep his culture alive and share it with the world. In fact, during the closing ceremony of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, he performed an ancient Ainu dance through a video, mesmerizing the world with his grace and aura.







The lifestyle of the Ainu community is dependent on the richness of nature. They worship various plants and animals they refer to as “Kamui” (gods) who give them blessings of nature and preserve their traditional rituals. Inheriting these traditions, Debo continues to promote the Ainu culture and pass it on to the next generation through woodcarving, lectures, and tourism.""One of the traditional tools of the Ainu people, who specialize in woodcarving, is the ikupasuy. The tool is used in rituals for drinking, and the Ainu use the ikupasuy to speak to the Kamui of the natural world. The tool is carved from hard, sticky wood such as oak and finished by applying vermilion, yellow, or black lacquer,"" said Debo. In the past, Debo drove to a home improvement store in Kushio City, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) away, to get lacquer.







“I was wondering what I was going to do when I couldn't obtain the lacquer anymore, and Amazon solved my problem,” Debo said.” It's so convenient that they can deliver to places so far away from the city. Thanks to them, I can make beautiful Ikupasuy and use them for my rituals.”Amazon has more than 20 fulfillment centers and close to 30 delivery stations in Japan to ensure the reliable delivery of products to remote areas all over the country.







""Our focus at Amazon is to ensure that customers, no matter where they reside, are able to get what they need. It has been humbling to see customers like Debo-san rely on us to pursue their passion and keep their culture and traditions alive,” said Awanish Narain Singh, director of Amazon Logistics in Japan. “Our customers truly inspire us to continue innovating and offering a reliable, safe, and trusted delivery experience across Japan.”

His father, Sam Kirkland, is also an entrepreneur and an Amazon Delivery Service Partner (DSP) who expected his son to be independent from an early age. The elder Kirkland said he continuously challenged his son to grow and didn’t offer handouts, only advice.“I gave him a few tips: Get a credit card and only charge what you’d normally spend, put together a savings plan, and create a network of people that you can grow with later in life,” he said.






Jaren Kirkland stands next to his dad, Sam, who inspired him to become an entrepreneur and an Amazon Delivery Service Partner.

The younger Kirkland graduated from the University of Michigan at age 20 and wanted to work for his father. His father suggested the opposite, telling his son: “You’re capable of more than following what’s familiar to you. I want you to go off on your own and seek out new experiences that I could never offer you.”After a year of working as a consultant in Washington, D.C., Kirkland began to consider becoming an Amazon DSP and business owner like his father. On paper, he had what it took to become an Amazon DSP, but saw his age as a barrier to being taken seriously. Regardless, he channeled his experience being around his family's logistics business growing up and started Duality Ventures and applied for the Amazon DSP program.Amazon accepted him into the program in 2020—over the past two years, he has grown his business from 12 drivers to 80 drivers.







“What I value most about being a DSP is that I have an opportunity to make a difference in people’s lives through employment,” Kirkland said. “There are those who may consider it daunting for someone at my age, but I’m honored to be able to lead a team of 80 and demonstrate that Generation Z has so much to offer.”Kirkland has coached employees who have been with him since day one and promoted them into management, all while creating a sustainable and profitable business.

“Jaren is one of those leaders you feel when he walks into the room. He always puts a smile on my face, and you can just see the respect that he gets from his team,” said Brandon Truiett, who works with Kirkland as Amazon’s site leader at delivery station site lead in Williamsport, Maryland.Kirkland takes pride in leadership and attributes his success to being ambitious and committed, yet progressive and compassionate. He not only motivates his employees to strive to be the best, he also empowers them to find work-life balance and to prioritize their mental health. He believes his role as a business owner goes beyond just being the boss—it's about getting the opportunity to help make peoples’ lives better and being a role model for the Black community.“His ability to relate to his drivers and Amazon management is what I’m most proud of,” said his father. “He never hesitates to help out. Nothing is ‘beneath’ Jaren and he leads with humbleness, that’s what makes a great leader. His mother, Vivian, his brothers, sisters, and I are all proud of him.”Amazon is investing in the future and constantly finding new ways to empower employees and partners to succeed.

Amazon sellers Cara Johnson-Graves and Jenae Johnson-Carr are taking positive affirmations to the next level with their business, EPIC Everyday.

Sisters Cara Johnson-Graves and Jenae Johnson-Carr have always been close. One day, as the two were having lunch, the conversation shifted to a topic that had been frustrating Jenae for some time: shopping for her children.""Jenae literally said, 'There's nothing available when I go to shop that looks like my children,'"" said Cara.Shopping for her kids had grown to be a painful experience for Jenae because of the market’s lack of inclusivity and representation. Despite seeing all sorts of products—including clothing, backpacks, and lunch bags—showcasing popular characters from children’s shows and other content, Jenae found it extremely rare to come across products showcasing characters that looked like her own kids.“You want things that affirm to your kids that their hair is perfect just like it is, their skin tone is beautiful just like it is,” said Jenae.


































She realized that if she noticed the lack of diversity, her kids probably did as well. That realization stuck with her.Jenae decided she wanted to make a difference, so she approached Cara with an idea--start business to address the lack of true inclusion and diversity. Cara was on board, and together—with no background in business or fashion, no information beyond their observations, and no research—the sisters jumped in.“I always say we had the audacity to dream big and then follow through,” said Cara.Cara and Jenae made a conscientious decision to design a positive, self-reflective collection to inspire the next generation. Both sisters were motivated to elevate the visibility of brown boys and girls. So, they created EPIC Everyday, a brand that creates apparel, accessories, and home goods that highlight Black brilliance and instill confidence, power, and pride in little ones. Even the business’ name reflects affirmations: Empowered, Positive, Innovative, and Creative.Through EPIC Everyday, Cara and Jenae aim to empower children to love their differences and embrace their unique, inherent style by amplifying “mocha-hued” positivity through the company’s products.


































“When we talk about ‘mocha-hued,’ we’re talking about beautiful, different skin tones, from light to dark,” said Jenae. “We’re also talking about different hairstyles.”While empowering and inspiring children remains their ultimate goal, Cara and Jenae are also looking to give back in other ways.""We both went to historically Black colleges, so we like to do more partnerships with those universities to give people a learning experience with our company,” said Jenae.










Bringing 'Beautiful Coffee to the People' by selling in Amazon’s store 

A key pandemic pivot helped Keba and Rachel Konte revitalize their coffee business to reach new customers—and heights.

Despite their lack of business backgrounds, Cara and Jenae leaned into their partnership with Amazon to help bolster their business. When the brand first debuted, it originally took an estimated three to five weeks to deliver customer orders. After launching in Amazon’s store, EPIC Everyday took advantage of Fulfillment by Amazon—Amazon’s service to pick, pack, and ship orders—which enabled customers to receive orders in just one to two days.One of the main challenges for EPIC Everyday has been capital. But that burden has been significantly lessened since the sisters became a part of the Black Business Accelerator (BBA), Amazon’s $150 million commitment to help build sustainable diversity and growth for Black entrepreneurs. Through the program, EPIC Everyday has had access to strategic business guidance and mentorship, and marketing and promotional support. The sisters also secured a grant that helped their business.







“Long-term for us is to grow this into what we call the ‘Mocha-Hued Movement,’” said Cara. “Whether it’s a literary series, whether it’s plush dolls that we can provide on Amazon.”Jenae added: “We’re showing our kids that they can do anything they want to. They see that their parents have put their minds to something that is totally different, and they have been successful in doing it. And they’ve been helping us along the way, as well.”For Cara and Jenae, out of frustration came inspiration, motivation, and eventually satisfaction.“My hope is that all kids realize that they are empowered, positive, innovative, and creative, just like our slogan is, and they feel like they are important, no matter what,” said Jenae.Shop EPIC Everyday and other Black-owned small businesses selling in Amazon’s store.

Amazon recently pledged support for a new public-private collaboration called Partnership for Zero, which is taking a united approach to dramatically reduce unsheltered homelessness. The coalition is initially focusing on downtown Seattle but will soon expand to target a set of regional communities.Building on efforts that led to the creation of the King County Regional Homelessness Authority (KCRHA), the City of Seattle and King County partnered with We Are In––an advocacy coalition of philanthropies, businesses, service providers, advocates, and both housed and unhoused King County residents. Together, the public and private entities launched Partnership for Zero to support KCRHA’s goal of reducing homelessness by targeting areas in King County—the most populous county in Washington state, and county in which Seattle sits. Local companies are also supporting the effort and have committed more than $10 million of private contributions in the first year, which includes a donation from Amazon.“Amazon is pleased to support Partnership for Zero as it works to bring together local government, nonprofits, and businesses to continue to address the homeless crisis with urgency and compassion,” said Alice Shobe, global director of Amazon in the Community.The goal is to build a future where homelessness is rare overall, and brief when it occurs, by combining resources and investing in targeted infrastructure and capacity. The coalition hopes to put every person experiencing unsheltered homelessness on the path toward permanent housing.The KCRHA is a new administration created in 2019 and co-funded by the City of Seattle and King County. The authority implements a coordinated, county-wide approach to solving homelessness and is independently operated under the leadership of CEO Marc Dones. Addressing homelessness at a regional level is a new approach for Washington state, but it is a proven and successful model in other parts of the country.The Partnership for Zero model is designed to quickly react, adjust in real time as lessons are learned, and demonstrate success in a targeted area, using a combination of public and private resources. Downtown Seattle currently holds the largest concentration of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness in King County, so Partnership for Zero will initially focus in that area, expanding to other communities in the future.










Amazon launches $2 billion Housing Equity Fund 

Amazon’s Housing Equity Fund is a $2 billion commitment to preserve and create more than 20,000 affordable homes by 2025 in Washington State’s Puget Sound region, the Arlington, Virginia region, and Nashville, Tennessee. 




Watch now
















Partnership for Zero is one of the many ways Amazon is involved in addressing housing issues in the Puget Sound region and elsewhere. The Amazon Housing Equity Fund is providing more than $2 billion in low-rate loans and grants to preserve and create affordable homes for individuals and families earning moderate to low incomes in the Puget Sound region, in and around Arlington, Virginia, and in Nashville, Tennessee. These are three places where Amazon has a sizable and growing presence.Along with the Amazon Housing Equity Fund, Amazon has provided an additional $100 million in cash and in-kind donations to its nonprofit partner Mary’s Place to build the largest family shelter in Washington state. The shelter is inside an Amazon office building at its Puget Sound headquarters. Amazon has also provided a $5 million gift to Plymouth Housing to provide permanent supportive housing for people experiencing homelessness in Seattle.Learn more about Amazon's housing equity efforts.

During Black History Month, Black professionals reflect on positive experiences at AWS.

As a Black man joining a global company, Jibril Touzi recalls entering the unknown when he started as a cloud support engineer at Amazon Web Services (AWS) in Cape Town, South Africa, in 2014.






Jibril Touzi, senior edge specialist solutions architect at AWS

“When you’re from a minority group—race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, religion, ethnicity—and you join a (large) company like Amazon, there’s always some apprehension and anxiety,” Touzi said. “Two main questions torment your mind: ‘Will I be accepted as I am? Will my work be recognized at its fair value?’”Touzi, who is originally from Cameroon in Africa, quickly learned that at Amazon, the answer to his two questions was a resounding “yes.” He felt welcomed by all employees and never like an outsider. He also never experienced any problems with English not being his native language.As AWS has grown, so have organized efforts around inclusion, diversity, and equity. Amazon now boasts 13 affinity and diversity groups, whose presence can be traced back to groundwork laid by the Black Employee Network affinity group, or BEN.Established in 2005, BEN’s primary purpose has been to provide a support structure for Black employees at Amazon and to champion inclusion and diversity throughout the company and across the globe.‘Not OK with the status quo or performative change’






Angelina Howard, senior product manager, AWS Industry Products

Angelina Howard, former president and current advisor for BEN, said AWS has been one of BEN’s biggest supporters. She’s happy to see the AWS Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity (ID&E) team celebrate Black culture opportunities for Black employees via programs like BEN Rise Leadership and Management Leaders for Tomorrow (MLT).“The AWS ID&E team does a great job empowering Black culture internally and externally,” Howard said. “For example, in 2020 AWS spearheaded a video forum series called ‘Courageous Conversations,’ which provided a safe space for employees to discuss [the] racial trauma that the Black community was feeling in 2020.”










Why Forbes is recognizing this Amazon leader

Angelina Howard followed her passion to support employees, customers, and communities during a difficult year.

Howard, who transitioned to AWS from the Amazon Consumer organization in 2021, has led initiatives resulting in grants for Black-owned businesses during COVID-19 and helped create a Black Excellence Gala that benefitted organizations dedicated to STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education. She also helped create BEN Startup Week, a week-long series of events promoting Black entrepreneurship and innovation; the BEN Scholarship Program for students; and BEN Rise, an eight-month program that helps accelerate the success of future Black leaders at Amazon.While these and similar programs and initiatives are effecting real change across the organization, Howard appreciates that there’s always more work to do. Howard’s optimism about the future is similar to the enthusiasm that’s common among AWS builders—a feeling that innovation never slows and there’s no limit to how far your ideas can take you.“There is still work that needs to be done and leaders recognize that. I have seen AWS senior leaders create goals and mechanisms to not only increase representation, but also make the culture inclusive for existing employees,"" Howard said. ""AWS leaders are not OK with the status quo or performative change.”Attracting diverse talent






Ebony Taylor, inclusion, diversity, and equity leader at AWS

Ebony Taylor led a team dedicated to inclusive initiatives to intentionally drive equity in talent decisions and attract diverse talent. Taylor now leads the Builder Engagement team on the Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity team and is proud of its three main focus areas: Learning and inclusion: providing learning products to educate builders on inclusion and equityCommunity engagement: creating STEM pathways in underserved communities to transform the future of technologyEquity experience: providing programming and solutions to reimagine the experience of diverse talent throughout the employee lifecycleBlack representation across Amazon is on the rise, and our commitment to continuing this upward trajectory is steadfast.“If all Amazonians looked the same with the same lived experiences,” Taylor said, “we would struggle to think more broadly and holistically and create products and solutions for all customers.”






David Williams, AWS senior technical account manager  

Beyond Amazon’s internal efforts to grow representation, AWS Senior Technical Account Manager David Williams especially appreciates efforts that encourage and support youth of color to pursue STEM education and alternative learning programs. His hope is that young people of color have opportunities to study computer programming, web design, cybersecurity, and other technology fields in the same way students in high school study trades to become an auto mechanic, electrician, HVAC technician, and more.“Too often in the world we live in, college is the only way in—but not everyone can attend college or is suited for that,” Williams said.This is precisely the intent behind programs like the Amazon Future Engineer Class Chats, where Amazon and AWS professionals volunteer to share their personal career journeys with K-12 students and answer questions about careers in tech. AWS Worldwide Specialists Account Manager Brandon Middleton began volunteering for the program in 2020 and has given Class Chats to hundreds of students from fifth to 12th grades, with many more scheduled in 2022. He’s also secured nearly $40,000 in contributions for Bay Area STEM nonprofits where he volunteers.Middleton, who has an MBA from UC Berkeley and a B.S. in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said he cares deeply about fixing the opportunity gap in the tech industry so that historically underserved communities get access to participate in STEM-related careers.Inclusive culture—and tech






Brandon Middleton, AWS worldwide specialists account manager

AWS Technologist Diya Wynn has dreamed of a tech career since she was in the third grade, which is when she got her first computer. She said that computer helped her imagine a future of opportunities that looked nothing like what she’d seen or grown up around.After nearly 30 years influencing products and delivering services for early- and growth-stage companies, she joined Amazon expecting to experience the same challenges that Black women working in tech often face. She said the supportive and accepting community she found at AWS was a refreshing departure from what she’d come to expect in corporate working environments.






Diya Wynn, AWS technologist 

AWS/Amazon has growing communities of like-minded individuals throughout the company. There are affinity and common interest groups that are central to the vibrant community I've experienced and been active in,"" Wynn said. ""The way we talk about inclusion here—trusted, valued, connected, and informed—requires acceptance, and building an inclusive culture is always an area of focus.”Ever since Wynn joined AWS, she’s had opportunities to influence organizations, shape programs, and impact how they’re delivered. She said she’s been able to accomplish this at a scale and scope far beyond what she’s been able to do at previous organizations, thanks to the inclusive culture at AWS.“I'm also proud of the impact we can now make helping organizations build safe, fair, and equitable systems and products with artificial intelligence (AI),” Wynn said. “This can move people and organizations to use their power and influence to create space and advantage for others. That’s building inclusive tech and something to be proud of.”Communities for learning and buildingCommunity is something Senior Software Development Engineer Jenee Benjamin has found through various ways across AWS. She’s participated in workshops about topics ranging from Amazon’s promotion process to technical problem-solving challenges for engineers. For the Black community, there are channels and resources to find mentors, career development, open Amazon and AWS positions, volunteer opportunities, and many other interests.






Jenee Benjamin, senior software development engineer at AWS

“Community is invaluable for me. Each time I had a community around me, I thrived and it was easy for me to give my best effort in those settings,” Benjamin said. “Community is a place of support and a place to feel comfortable being yourself—these are the conditions that many people need in order to flourish, myself included. People can find inspiration, mentors, and friends when they find community.”Benjamin has represented AWS at various conferences such as the Grace Hopper Conference, the National Society of Black Engineers’ professional conference, Afrotech, and AWS’s re:Invent 2021, where she talked about some of the new Athena features her organization had developed. She enjoys these opportunities where she’s able to show that there are successful Black women software engineers.“There are Black women at AWS who thrive, and AWS is investing in careers for Black people. My management gives me opportunities to work on the most challenging projects, to show off my work, and to grow in many roles,” Benjamin said. “The BEN community is an amazing community to get mentoring and to get support for growing professionally. AWS can be a fantastic place to learn and to become a leader.”To learn more about these and other AWS stories in celebration of Black History Month, visit Remarkably Black.

He enjoys exploring new places, cycling, reading, and exercising his taste buds, particularly with double-scoop gelato.







The number two is significant for me in a few ways. My birthday is in February, and I have two sisters and two daughters. Two-and-a-half years ago, my family and I left our home country of India to come and live in Germany. While we miss our friends and extended family—and the food—it’s been a fabulous experience meeting new people, understanding the culture, learning a new language, and discovering different attitudes. According to the Germans I know, “There’s no such thing as bad weather, only inappropriate clothing.”Some good things in tech that come in pairs? For me—at least for the past 22 days—it’s been my partnership with my onboarding buddy. I’m only just settling in and getting to know the organization, so it’s fantastic to have someone I can turn to when I have questions, and who can help me understand how I can be successful going forward.My favorite two-minute snack isn’t actually my favorite, it’s my family’s. In India, there’s a really popular brand of instant noodles called Maggi 2-minute noodles. I don’t eat them very often, but my wife and children love them.I have a favorite duo, but they’re not exactly famous. It’s my mom and my dad. So much of who I am today and my philosophy towards life is thanks to the way they brought me up.I’ve not been at AWS that long, but two things that make me proud to be part of the team are the customer-centricity and the opportunities—whether that’s the opportunity to innovate, to chart my own career course, or to balance my professional and personal life. From what I’ve seen so far, there’s a lot of flexibility. We’re really encouraged to explore all the opportunities available to us.Maya Flores, partner solutions architect, Washington, United States Flores has been at AWS for two months. She has two brothers and two sisters. She likes cooking, hiking, and rock climbing, and she has recently fallen in love with skiing.







I’m a computer engineering major, and for me, the number two is significant because of the binary system. Everything in traditional—as opposed to quantum—computing is based on information as a combination of zeros and ones. When you think about it, it’s like these two digits underwrite almost everything we do.A two-minute snack I loved as a kid is celery and peanut butter with whole raisins on top. It tastes amazing. I still make it now as a treat.My favorite celebrity duo is Tom Holland and Zendaya. I think they’re really cute.How would I spend a 22-minute work break right now? I’ve got an 9-month-old chocolate Labrador puppy called Cato, so it has to be taking him for a walk.Two of the best things about working at AWS are the sense of community and the constant innovation. If I see something I think can be improved, I know I can bring it up with my manager and we’ll work on a plan. You can put ideas forward, and people will be there to support you.   Two of the coolest things about my job? First, as a partner solutions architect, I get to work with a bunch of small tech companies, to help them become partners and get their workloads validated. I can see what’s going on across the tech industry. Second, my onboarding buddy, Mansi. I’m constantly pinging her with questions and asking for advice. She’s helped me out so much. I really appreciate it.Antoine Poinvil, data center engineering operations, Virginia, United States Poinvil has been at AWS for two years. He loves to travel, read books, and work on cars.







The number two is special to me because I was born on June 22. Plus 22 is my lucky number. It’s a master number, according to numerology.If I have to grab a snack in two minutes, trail mix is my go-to.My favorite pairing? Definitely a vanilla ice cream sandwich with chocolate chip cookies.Two of the best things about my job are the flexibility and the fact that I’m continuously learning from everyone I work with.My favorite famous duo has to be Beyoncé and Jay-Z. They’re one of the most powerful couples in the world with a lot of hit collaborations. Drunk in Love is one of my favorites.Two reasons I’m proud to work for AWS: 1) Constant growth—in opportunities and the company itself. 2) The feeling that we’re making history.Kurt Kufeld, VP, AWS Platform, Washington, United StatesKufeld is celebrating not one but two 22-year anniversaries in 2022. He joined Amazon and got married in the year 2000.







The number two is pretty significant in computing and in my job. You could say it’s the basis of everything I do every day. Computers operate using the binary system, which has only two digits—one and zero. I know all of the powers of two, right up to two to the power of 32, because I work with them all the time.Some great things that come in twos? In tech, it’s got to be monitors. In my life, it’s cats. I have three pairs.If I could take a 22-minute work break right now, I’d put on my headphones and listen to an audio book. Or spend time with my cats.My favorite two-minute snack is Special K. I eat it for breakfast every day. It takes me less than two minutes to make it (and the same amount of time to eat it, my wife would probably say).My favorite duo? Probably, the Obamas. They’re deeply impressive.Two of the best things about my job: 1) People. I’m honored to work with great people every day. 2) The customers I get to work with. They are truly amazing. It’s really invigorating and fulfilling to help solve their problems.Kevin Gasper, Finance Director, Washington, United States Gasper is a native Washingtonian who joined Amazon 22 years ago. He enjoys hiking, biking, skiing, spending time on Whidbey Island, drinking lattes, and relaxing with his wife and three children.







If I had two minutes to make a snack, I’d go for nachos or warming up a chocolate chip cookie (but that only takes 20 seconds).Some of my favorite pairings? Wine and cheese. Peanut butter and chocolate. Espresso and milk. My head and a pillow.If I could take a 22-minute break right now, I’d get on my Peloton and do one of their great 20-minute workouts or two 10-minute ones.If I had to name a favorite duo, I’d say Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, probably because I’m watching the Last Dance at the moment. Also, Jim Zorn and Steve Largent, the legendary NFL players. I’m a big Seahawks fan.Two of the best aspects of my job are my team and my business partners. They’re the reason I get so excited about work. They keep me on my toes and make sure I’m always learning new things

Quincy Howard, Manager, IA Forensics and Fraud, Virginia, United States Howard has been at AWS for just over four years—but his connection with the number two isn't at work.Why is the number two significant for me? Well, I’m an identical twin, and our birthday is February 22. I’m married and my wife is also a twin.If I could take a 22-minute work break right now, I'd probably go down to Starbucks and grab a venti White Chocolate Mocha steamed hot.Two things that make me most proud to be part of the AWS team are our culture, because we truly are customer obsessed and always looking for ways to do things better on behalf of our customers, and our people. I get to work with some of the smartest people, trying to do things that have never been done before.How do I feel about the opportunity to witness such a cool palindrome date in my lifetime? Truthfully, I’d not really thought about it, but it sounds like an excellent day—it is my birthday, after all.

Amazon’s solar project in South Africa supplies clean, renewable power to AWS data centers and supports economic opportunities for local women and businesses.

Amazon’s new 10-megawatt solar plant is up and running in South Africa’s Northern Cape Province, the largest province in the country. The plant is expected to generate up to 28,000 megawatt-hours (MWh) of renewable energy per year, which equals the annual electricity consumption of over 8,000 average South African homes.The solar plant consists of over 24,000 bifacial solar panels—capturing sunlight on both sides—covering an area of 20 hectares in the Northern Cape. The solar panels track the sun throughout the day, absorbing solar energy from the sky and reflected light from the ground. The design will result in avoiding an estimated 25,000 tons of carbon emissions annually, the equivalent of removing 5,400 cars from the road in South Africa.“Amazon is committed to working with governments and utility suppliers around the world to help bring more renewable energy projects online,"" said Nat Sahlstrom, director of energy at Amazon Web Services. ""We’re honored to work with the Department of Minerals and Energy, the National Energy Regulator of South Africa, and Eskom to help deliver a new model for renewable energy generation in South Africa.""Powering energy and economic transformationThe Northern Cape solar project also contributes to the region’s economic transformation. The solar plant, which contributes to South Africa’s 2030 renewable energy goals, is majority-owned by black women and operated by a fully South African-owned company.“Historically, black women have been critically underrepresented in infrastructure, agriculture, and utility ownership,” says Meta Mhlarhi, co-founder and executive director at Mahlako a Phahla Investments, an investor in the project. “Energy projects that enable black investment are our surest way to a just transition to renewable energy.”The project created 167 jobs in local communities during construction and will sustain permanent jobs for its lifetime to support the electrical maintenance, operation, and security. The project also reduced waste by donating unused materials from construction, including pallets and electrical cable drums, to local furniture businesses and special skills schools to support small and medium-sized businesses.“While we’re building renewable energy capacity in South Africa, we must also develop South African companies and skills,” says Dom Wills, CEO of SOLA Group, the South African company responsible for developing and operating the energy plant. “SOLA is committed to transforming South Africa through clean energy, and being able to sell renewables to corporates at large scale makes this one of the most significant power projects in South African History.”Achieving a sustainable futureWe are committed to building a sustainable business for customers and the planet, and it’s why we co-founded The Climate Pledge in 2019, becoming the first signatory and setting a goal to meet the Paris Agreement 10 years early by reaching net-zero carbon by 2040. This project brings Amazon closer to powering our global operations with 100% renewable energy, a commitment Amazon is on path to reach by 2025—five years before the original 2030 goal.










The Climate Pledge

Amazon is committed to building a sustainable business for our customers and the planet. In 2019, Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge—a commitment to be net zero carbon across our business by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement.

In 2020, Amazon became the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy, reaching 65% renewable energy across our business. Amazon now has a portfolio of over 270 global renewable energy projects, totaling over 12 gigawatts of renewable capacity globally. Once all these projects are operational, we estimate that more than 13.7 million metric tons of carbon emissions will be avoided each year—the equivalent of taking nearly 3 million cars off U.S. roads each year.The Northern Cape solar project is another proud step on Amazon’s renewable energy journey.

Learn how the Urban Systems Lab is using Amazon Web Services to model simulations to help mitigate the impacts of urban flooding driven by climate change on at-risk communities.

Buildings, roads, and sidewalks are all impervious surfaces, which means they do not allow water to seep through. That also means such infrastructure is a major factor in urban flooding. One solution could be green infrastructure.Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) podcast Fix This recently welcomed Christopher Kennedy, assistant director of the Urban Systems Lab, and research fellow Pablo Herreros Cantis, to discuss green infrastructure and the technology aiding their research. They say green infrastructure has the potential to address environmental injustices and help vulnerable populations by reducing urban flooding risks related to climate change.

“In general, in a lot of U.S. cities, there's a long history of banking institutions, mortgage institutions, not providing the resources for certain communities,” said Kennedy. Herreros added: “And it has been shown already, with relative consistency, that formerly redlined neighborhoods and neighborhoods that have a higher percentage of minority populations have more impervious surfaces.”The Urban Systems Lab, which is based at The New School in New York City, focuses on research and providing new insight into developing more equitable, resilient, and sustainable cities. The Lab is focused on helping municipal governments better plan where to implement green infrastructure investments. Through the Lab’s Environmental Justice and Green Infrastructure Research project, a project supported by the Kresge Foundation’s CREWS program, Kennedy and Herreros are currently working with local non-governmental organizations, such as Groundwork USA, and communities in the U.S. The implementation of green infrastructure to address issues such as flooding provides several ecological functions—including infiltration, evaporation, and other natural processes—to handle storm water that would otherwise flow into urban drains or sewers. Through green infrastructure, water is instead absorbed by soil or moved below the surface, or it evaporates.The team is currently examining the disproportionate effects of urban flooding and climate change on minority and low-income communities in four small- and medium-sized U.S. cities: Syracuse and Yonkers, New York; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Elizabeth, New Jersey.







Herreros said the Lab selected the cities based on commonalities, including, “We were looking for locations in which we were going to be able to connect with organizations or municipal governments that would be interested in collaborating.”Socioeconomic factors that create vulnerabilities also play a role in urban flooding, such as poverty, a lack of health insurance, and access to green space. Kennedy and Herreros note that when existing social disparities overlap with extreme weather events, they can compound harmful outcomes.

The Urban System Lab integrates those social variables into its analysis and proposed solutions. The Lab takes an interdisciplinary approach by bringing together designers, scientists, and practitioners to work on complex questions about how cities interact with different ecological, technological, and social systems.When Herreros initiated model simulations to investigate the root causes for why urban flooding more heavily impacts certain communities, he quickly realized that the simulations would require more computational power to complete the project and accelerate the research. With support from the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) and AWS Promotional Credits, the Lab’s simulations now run on the AWS Cloud.“What we have so far been exploring in our work is focused on the distribution of current flood risk,” Herreros said. However, he noted: “It's not only what is happening now, it's also where are we heading and how we need to consider that we need to make very cautious decisions on how to adapt climate change in a way that doesn't leave anyone behind.”To learn more, visit AWS Sustainability Customer Stories for a multimedia look at how AWS customers are building in the cloud to innovate, expedite, and scale real-world sustainability solutions.Subscribe to Fix This on Spotify to stay up to date on the latest Fix This episodes, featuring customers from around the world that use AWS to solve some of the world’s most pressing challenges.

Upskilling initiative helps military veterans and spouses transition to cloud computing careers through paid learning and training—no technical experience required.

Brittany Wilkins is a former police officer and deputy sheriff, the owner of two much-loved French bulldogs, an active member of the U.S. Air Force Reserves, and now, a data center technician in training. She is also the 1,000th person Amazon Web Services (AWS) has hired through the Amazon Technical Apprenticeship program, which helps military veterans and their spouses transition into tech careers, and has since expanded to help other groups.The program, which started as a pilot in 2017, does not require candidates to have previous technical experience. Instead, it provides successful applicants, like Wilkins, with the opportunity to get paid while learning and training on the job, for up to 18 months, in a range of apprenticeship roles, including solutions architect, software development engineer, and cloud support associate.










Our Upskilling 2025 programs

In September 2021, Amazon committed $1.2 billion to provide 300,000 employees with access to education and skills training programs—including college tuition for front-line employees—through 2025 as part of Amazon’s Upskilling 2025 pledge.

The Amazon Technical Apprenticeship program is part of Amazon’s $1.2 billion commitment to provide free education and skills training opportunities to more than 300,000 U.S. Amazon employees by 2025. It focuses on the military community because, according to program lead Nick Curry, its members already exhibit so many of the Amazon Leadership Principles, such as Ownership, Bias for Action, and Insist on the Highest Standards. “When you’ve had to live underwater in a tin can for more than 60 days straight, with a group of people from completely different walks of life, you find that common ground,” said Curry, formerly a member of the U.S. Navy himself, who joined Amazon in 2017. “Whether you’re in a submarine, like I was, a trench, or the middle of the desert, you have to rely on each other. I really believe you learn these values in the military in a way you don’t anywhere else.” We spoke with Wilkins, and two other program participants about their experience and the transformative impact it has had on their ambitions. If you or someone you know is interested in applying, visit the program website for more information.Brittany WilkinsData center technician apprentice, Washington, D.C.







In 2021, Brittany Wilkins was scrolling through her LinkedIn feed one morning when she saw something that would change the course of her career entirely. “I came across a post advertising the AWS apprenticeship program,” she said. “What stood out to me was that you don’t need to have a background in IT, which I don’t. I thought, ‘I can't pass this up. It will give me everything I need to get my foot in the door.” It was the final day for applications, so Wilkins had to act fast. She hurried home after work to submit her information before the deadline. At the time, she was serving as a law enforcement officer with the Defense Intelligence Agency, having already spent five years as a deputy sheriff and a police officer in Alexandria, Virginia. Doing something that involved “serving her community” had been a major calling for Wilkins. Working as a police officer had given her self-confidence and the knowledge that she wasn’t afraid to take control of a situation. Over the years, she found herself pulled in another direction. “I was seeing all these roles being advertised in technology, and I started thinking about how to switch over,” said Wilkins. Her interest in technology wasn’t new. From an early age, Wilkins would watch her father, who works in IT, “doing things with computers.” She just hadn’t thought of tech as a viable career option for herself or connected it with her passion for helping people.“I had this image of working by myself, fixing things. I didn't really see the correlation with supporting clients that I see now,” said Wilkins.Wilkins secured a place on the Data Center Technician path of the apprenticeship program. Currently, she’s working through an instructor-led training course. That means that while she’s studying and working, professional trainers guide her and her group through everything they need to know to achieve the certifications required to move to the next stage. The next stage is getting inside a real data center for 9–12 months for on-the-job training. “It’s going to be a very hands-on role,” she said. “That’s what really attracts me. I want to learn all I can, especially about hardware, and maybe one day cross over into software. I think eventually I’d like to get into network engineering or cloud security. I like the idea of ensuring that people and their information stay safe.”Courtney Sampson Associate solutions architect, North Carolina 







After an early career in banking, Courtney Sampson joined the U.S. Air Force as a way to get into tech, but he was placed into weather forecasting. While he found this somewhat technical, it was not the career he wanted to pursue. When his military contract ended, he decided to explore other routes into the tech world.Sampson’s AWS apprenticeship was his first step into a technology career. “It was something like a fire hose of information coming in,” he said. “The broadness and vastness of the technology landscape was just mind-blowing.” Before starting the apprenticeship, Sampson said he had no idea what a solutions architect (SA) was and only limited knowledge of AWS technology. He quickly learned that AWS is an enormous enterprise and solutions architects have a broad role in which they touch a lot of technologies and work with a wide variety of customers. Sampson completed his apprenticeship in 2020 and is now employed full time by AWS. His role is to guide different AWS customers on their cloud journey. He advises them on which services to use, helps them build applications, and shows them the “art of the possible” in the cloud.Today, he continues to find his role interesting and challenging. In the immediate future, he wants to keep building his knowledge. “I’m grateful that programs like this exist,” said Sampson. “I'm not sure how else I would have gotten into this career without this opportunity. Most jobs require some sort of experience, but AWS really takes a risk by investing in people who don’t necessarily have the right technical background, but do have the approach to leadership that Amazon looks for. I really only made it this far because of AWS’s support.”Emma NgSolutions architect apprentice, North Carolina







 As a military spouse, Emma Ng moves frequently to support her husband’s career. Initially, she found pursuing her own career challenging. That changed in April 2021, when she joined the AWS apprenticeship program. Currently living in North Carolina, Ng just graduated as a solutions architect. It’s a role that can be done from anywhere, meaning she can use her newfound expertise wherever she moves in the United States.“A lot of times, military bases are in remote areas, so there are not many job opportunities,” she said. “AWS designed this program to be 100% remote, so when military spouses move, we can take our job with us and not have to worry about finding something new.” Prior to joining the program, Ng—who studied food science, chemistry, and math at college, and speaks Japanese—had been doing business development for a startup, focusing on the Asia–Pacific region. “I had very little technical experience, unless you consider sending emails technical,” she said.Ng heard about the AWS apprenticeship from her brother, a Marine Corps veteran who graduated from the program four years ago. “Before he got the apprenticeship, he’d set his sights low as to what he could do once he transitioned out of the military,” said Ng. “Working at AWS and having people around him who were interested in his success really helped him grow. He started to set much higher goals. It had such a positive impact on his life—financially, physically, and emotionally.” “The learning curve on the apprenticeship is very steep,” said Ng. “But it's also rewarding because you look back and say, ‘Eight months ago, I didn't know anything, and now I can have a conversation with a customer, understand their needs, and help develop a solution.’” Ng said that her biggest takeaway from the program was learning to be more comfortable with failing and failing fast. “AWS really encourages that,” she said. “When we approach a problem, we try a solution. If that doesn’t work, we try a different one. It wasn't something I was used to, but it inspires creativity. If you're not afraid to fail, you're not afraid to think of new solutions or try new things.” Ng is excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. “I’m specifically interested in security in the cloud and protecting customers against cyberattacks,” said Ng. “At AWS, people have been so supportive and encouraging, saying, ‘anything you want to do, there are mentors and people out there to help you. That's really cool.”If you or someone you know is interested in applying to the AWS Technical Apprenticeship program, which recently expanded beyond military veterans and their spouses, visit the website for more information.

""An Alzheimer’s diagnosis is the beginning of a long and complicated journey, and I think Alexa has been a priceless tool in my toolkit in managing it.""

When couples marry and commit to one another in sickness and in health, they promise that no matter what happens, they’ll look after one another. For Georgia, her husband’s unexpected Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis seven years ago led her to caring for him in new ways.Thankfully, with the help of her community, the people around her, and Alexa, supporting her husband and keeping track of everything they need—from medication to joyful moments—has become a little easier.







In Georgia’s words:When I found out my husband was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, I immediately began teaching him how he could use Alexa. We knew that we had a long and tricky road ahead of us, so I thought showing him how to use Alexa would be a great tool for us both.Initially, he just sat and watched me use the Echo in our home, and we began to set up reminders to help our days run more smoothly. With Alzheimer’s, there’s a lot of medications to take—Alexa has been so valuable in reminding us to not miss a dose.







Over time, he’s really grown attached to Alexa. When we got our first Echo Show and he was able to see old photos on the screen, that was when he really began to love it. He’s becoming more and more comfortable talking to Alexa. With Alzheimer’s, he’ll often forget if he’s already asked a question, and Alexa never gets frustrated with him no matter how many times he asks.And it’s really not just tangible things—one of the best things Alexa has brought us is joy. My husband finds Alexa so entertaining. He loved the special holiday greetings, he loves playing his music, and he can spend hours sitting in front of our Echo Show, watching photos go by and identifying people in the pictures.







Alexa has saved us huge amounts of time, and I’ve recommended Alexa to so many of my friends who are in the same situation. Alexa is another voice in our house, someone we can both talk to. An Alzheimer’s diagnosis is the beginning of a long and complicated journey, and I think Alexa has been just a priceless tool in my toolkit in managing it.

A key pandemic pivot helped Keba and Rachel Konte revitalize their coffee business to reach new customers—and heights.

Community is everything for the husband-and-wife team of Keba and Rachel Konte.Rachel, born and raised in Copenhagen, Denmark, moved to the United States in 1993. Four years later, she met her husband-to-be, Keba, a native of the San Francisco Bay Area. Since then, the two have built a life together, raising their two daughters and launching a business within the community.That business is Red Bay Coffee. Coffee isn’t just that morning pick-me-up for Keba and Rachel. Coffee represents opportunity—to take a moment to slow down and reflect, to participate in the coffee culture, and to gather energy for whatever comes next.







“Coffee is that moment in the morning when I get to reset,” said Keba. “I warm up that water, weigh out my coffee, grind it. [It’s] my daily ritual.”With that in mind, in 2014 the two founded Red Bay Coffee. The pair started the company in their home, and were able to build their business with the support of family and friends and an initial crowdfunding campaign. For Keba, as an African American, owning his own business and succeeding holds deep value.“It gives you the opportunity to not only direct your life and your future and your destiny, but you’re also able to have a positive impact on your community,” Keba said.







Driven by Keba and Rachel’s unwavering leadership, Red Bay Coffee is now at the forefront of what they refer to as the “fourth wave of coffee”—a firm commitment to ensure our coffee is not only high-quality and sustainable, but a vehicle for diversity, inclusion, social and economic restoration, and entrepreneurship.""We have made room for inclusion and diversity in the specialty coffee industry,” Keba said. “We ethically source, we roast it, and brew it. That’s really our ethos: making specialty coffee more accessible to more people.”Red Bay sources directly from countries with the unique combination of climate and elevation required for high-grade specialty coffees, and seeks to empower and support local growers’ entry into specialty coffee.After quickly becoming a staple of the community with its tagline “Beautiful Coffee to the People,” Red Bay’s brick-and-mortar presence grew beyond just being another neighborhood coffee joint. The brand’s public roastery in Oakland became a community hub, hosting events such as food pop-ups, concert residencies, magazine releases, panel discussions, and self-care festivals. However, when COVID-19 struck in 2020, the community that Keba and Rachel cultivated was in jeopardy.""A lot of businesses were devastated,” Keba said. “Ours was impacted heavily. We had to close down a lot of our shops. We had to reconnect with our customers in other ways. And the first and most direct pathway was through ecommerce.""







For many small businesses, ecommerce became a lifeline in the wake of the pandemic. Keba and Rachel saw the pandemic as an opportunity to reach their existing customers in new ways, while also leveraging their selling partnership with Amazon to enable a much broader audience to discover Red Bay Coffee.“Amazon played an important role in that pivot when we had to reconnect with our customers,” Keba said.Like many of Amazon’s nearly 2 million selling partners, most of which are small and medium-sized businesses, Red Bay pivoted to online sales and thrived, growing nearly 100% year over year from 2020 to 2021. Red Bay recently joined Amazon’s Black Business Accelerator, a $150 million commitment to help build sustainable diversity and growth for Black entrepreneurs by enabling their success as sellers in Amazon's store.

Keba and Rachel aim to showcase their backgrounds and history through the brand’s label and package design, while also drawing inspiration from the origin countries for each roast. Keba and Rachel are intentional about eliminating barriers and creating opportunities for people, including those who may need a second chance.“I didn’t know what to do with my life after incarceration. When I met Keba and Rachel, they put their trust in me, and welcomed me into their home, it felt like a new beginning,” said Jessie Llarinas, coffee trainer and tech manager at Red Bay Coffee. “My experience with Red Bay has helped me to grow and learn new things. Keba and Rachel believed in me and I am grateful to be where I am today.”







Currently, Red Bay employs almost 50 people, from baristas and roasters to quality control managers and marketing team members. Both Keba and Rachel take pride in having built a business that not only provides great coffee, but also opportunities for people from all walks of life, many of whom may have never considered a career in the coffee industry.“As we grow our business in scale and geography, we look forward to folks paying a visit, taking pride, feeling welcome,” Keba said. “And if we do that, then we know we’ve done something right.”Shop Red Bay Coffee and other Black-owned small businesses selling in Amazon’s store.

Amazon recognizes Black History month by highlighting Black-owned small businesses, along with Black creators, celebrities, authors, and employees.

Amazon’s Black History Month theme is Black is remarkable. To celebrate, Amazon is focusing on Black entrepreneurs, from fashion designers to coffee experts, and sharing recommendations on books from Black writers and more.We also partnered with Seattle-based artist Moses Sun, who created the art on Amazon.com and in Amazon Pop-Up locations for Black History Month. Sun, a multi-disciplined artist, said he finds inspiration and motivation through the diversity of the Black community.Sun recently sat down with us to talk about his work, his advice for Black creators, and the exciting innovation he sees in the Black community. Read on to learn more about how to support  Black artists and entrepreneurs.












                “It's vital that our children have examples of Black entrepreneurship to know there are many paths to personal happiness.”
            

Moses Sun, artist and illustrator




Amazon’s Q&A with Moses Sun, artist and illustratorWhat does Black Culture mean to you? LOVE. Listen to Stevie Wonders' album, Songs in the Key of Life, and you will understand.What does “Black is remarkable” mean to you? A cosmos of expression and intention. It's our resilience and diverse points of view. Our willingness to sacrifice for our kids and family. The way we acknowledge one another through good and challenging times. The way we celebrate each other's wins.What Black creators, organizations, or movements inspire/empower you? Afrofuturism and hip-hop are movements that inspire and excite me. In particular, the art of Nyame Brown, Chelle Barbour, and Afroscope. Their art practices are both empowering and motivating.As a multi-disciplined artist who works in analog and digital mediums, Afrofuturism allows me to blend hip-hop and abstraction to create art that reflects the energy of the Pan-African diaspora. Based in Seattle, Na Wari is a fantastic arts organization that provides space for Black people to explore all facets of our culture through events, shows, historic preservation, and Black ownership by connecting through art.What is one area where you are particularly excited to see the Black community driving culture and innovation? A global Black renaissance is happening now. You can see it everywhere, from architecture, technology, fashion, lifestyle, medicine, and more. Our diasporas are as varied as any other, and it shows. I'm excited to see people from the Black community invest, innovate, develop, produce, and distribute our creativity.I love seeing Black entrepreneurs create products and services that disrupt and redefine industry categories. What advice would you give to other aspiring Black creators? If you do something well that positively impacts others, do more of it daily. Ask someone you could see yourself becoming in 10 to 20 years to be your mentor. Build your dream by sharing your knowledge and stories with other Black creators. Interact and learn about people from different cultures. Listen to your instincts (heart)—practice, practice, practice.What impacts do you want your work to have on future generations? I hope my work impacts the mindset of future generations. Take action on their dreams. Through art and collaboration, learn to find common ground with others' visions and innovate for the greater good of humanity.Amazon’s commitmentLearn about Black-owned small businesses selling on Amazon, and join Black influencers and creators during live conversations.

Senior UX Designer Justin Nikolaus spent three years learning how Alexa can help NASA astronauts during their upcoming mission to the Moon.

Some might say that if Alexa was destined for space, Justin Nikolaus was destined to help.Nikolaus, a senior UX designer on the Alexa Voice Service team, has spent the past three years making sure Alexa is ready for a trip to space as part of Artemis I, the first of several planned NASA missions to the Moon.










Alexa, take me to the Moon

Amazon and Lockheed Martin are sending Alexa to space as part of Callisto, a technology demonstration on NASA’s upcoming Artemis I mission.




Read more
















For Alexa, which was inspired in part by the talking computer in the original Star Trek TV series, it’s a natural progression. For Nikolaus, a lifetime space enthusiast, it’s a dream fulfilled.Recently, we spent time with Nikolaus to learn more about this project, as well as his own personal journey and passions.Tell us about your own Amazon journey.I joined Amazon over five years ago and have helped more than 30 partners—including Sonos, Ford, and Bose—integrate Alexa into their devices. I’ve also spent a few years working on the foundation of Alexa behaviors and visuals on our own Echo and Echo Show devices. Currently, I’m focused on creating bar-raising voice experiences for our customers on Earth and in space.Tell us more about this project and sending Alexa to space.I’ve personally been working on this project for the last three years. It’s a collaboration with Lockheed Martin to integrate Alexa into the crew cabin of NASA’s Orion spacecraft for Artemis I. While this first mission, expected to launch this spring, is uncrewed, it is helping NASA test technology that could be used in future crewed missions to the Moon and other space destinations.Our team has been working on features an astronaut might need during a mission. The first is access to mission telemetry, and that requires the ability to answer questions like, “Alexa, how fast is Orion traveling?” or “Alexa, what’s the temperature in the cabin?” The second is the ability to control connected devices onboard the spacecraft, such as in-cabin. The last is ensuring Alexa can retrieve information from back on Earth, like news briefings or sports scores, helping astronauts stay connected to home during long missions to deep space. Lockheed Martin made the custom, space-grade hardware with Alexa built-in, and the Amazon team handled all of the acoustic, audio-processing, and software work required to bring the experience to life.







The 'Star Trek' computer was part of the original inspiration for Alexa—is this project an example of the team bringing this vision to fruition?Absolutely! We want everyone to be able to use Alexa everywhere, and Alexa in space is an exciting next step. It shows that Alexa can be helpful in yet another environment outside the home, and there’s no place more challenging than space. There are no guarantees of what happens next, but we’re already seeing how Alexa can potentially help astronauts and others in mission control—making missions simpler, more efficient, and more enjoyable for those onboard.The technology we are building for this project will have applications on Earth, too. For example, the Alexa integration onboard uses our Local Voice Control technology, which allows Alexa to function in areas with limited-to-no connectivity, and the learnings here will help Alexa work better in cars and other remote environments. This isn’t a new idea—in fact, Velcro was created for the Apollo mission.What are some of the biggest challenges your teams faced, and how did you overcome them?First, this is a new domain for Alexa, so as a user-experience designer, I needed to dive deep and research everything there is to know about using voice in space and how we can help future astronauts. I got to talk with multiple astronauts about their jobs and uncover what mission-specific information and features would be most helpful for them. I also traveled to NASA’s facilities in Houston and brainstormed with their flight controllers and directors to ensure the experiences we were building were both relevant and accurate.Second, as you can imagine, space isn’t an easy environment to work in. You’re dealing with shock and vibration, radiation exposure, weight limits, and the unique acoustic properties of an enclosed metal crew-cabin traveling through space. Our team of engineers had to research the acoustic properties of the cabin and understand the sound quality of an actual spacecraft in flight. Lockheed Martin played a huge role here, given their long history of building hardware for space. That gave us a solid platform where we could apply our expertise in voice technology and AI.Lastly, this was a huge project with lots of ambiguity. There are so many aspects of this project that we’ve never done before—from user experience and marketing to building with space-grade materials. It’s been very exciting to take on a variety of tasks and tackle these new challenges. For example, one week I’m working on the industrial design of the speaker grill and light ring, and the next week I’m defining the response logic for reading the telemetry values coming back from flight software.It’s been a long and challenging project, but the team has done an incredible job inventing and executing.How can customers experience Alexa in space?Alongside the upcoming Artemis I mission, Alexa-enabled devices on Earth will be able to provide customers with in-depth information on Artemis I, such as telemetry data from the Orion spacecraft; videos and imagery from the mission, including a launch livestream; video of virtual crew interactions from Johnson Space Center, and reminders and notifications about key milestones in the mission. The new Artemis features for Alexa will launch closer to the mission, but a preview is available now. Just say, “Alexa, take me to the Moon,” or check out www.amazon.com/alexainspace.We understand in your free time you create space-themed comics for your kids. Tell us more about that.Space has always been a passion of mine, so when I was approached to work on this project, I jumped at the opportunity. Storytelling with visuals, such as wireframes and storyboards, is a natural part of my job to remove ambiguity, but I’m always looking for new, fun ways to keep my creative skills sharp. When my son, who is also very into space, headed to his first day of preschool, I decided to put a small drawing of an astronaut in his lunchbox and he absolutely loved it. Now, I have two sons, ages 2 and 4, and have created over 400 drawings for their lunches. Even when I head down to Houston for work, I draw a few before I leave so they always have a smile for lunch.







Tell us more about your background.In college, I studied both graphic design and computer science. I have always been drawn to the intersection of art and technology and how it can be used to help and connect people. Before joining Amazon, I worked for a handful of companies, including Thomson Reuters, Target, and Microsoft. I also co-founded a small startup. One of our products enabled people to enjoy the photos taken at events like weddings without having to pull out their phone, by streaming them to big screens for everyone to enjoy. I’m originally from Wisconsin, but for the last nine years I have lived in Seattle with my wife and two sons. When I’m not reading up on the latest space tech, I’m out playing tennis, wine tasting, or at home putting our pizza oven to use.

To support Amazon employees and the Filipino communities devastated by Typhoon Rai/Odette, we have implemented a series of initiatives.

Typhoon Rai/Odette hit the shores of the Philippines in December, leaving many people in the province of Cebu—including Amazon employees and the wider community—in a state of peril.As part of Amazon’s commitment to its employees and the communities in which it operates, Amazon has implemented a series of initiatives to help the Filipino community through these difficult times. The initiatives include financial support, mental well-being programs, and partnerships with nonprofits driving relief efforts.Financial support for our peopleTo aid our associates and employees in Cebu, we have created the Amazon Philippines Rai/Odette Relief Fund to offer an Emergency Response Grant and Property Damage Grant. With these programs, impacted employees and associates can administer repairs to their home, pay security deposits for new homes, replace damaged appliances and furniture, and repair or replace their vehicles.Amazon has also extended its Social Security Systems calamity loan assistance package to cover those impacted in Mimaropa, Western Visayas, Central Visayas, Eastern Visayas, Northern Mindanao, and Caraga regions of the Philippines. Those areas are impacted by to Typhoon Rai/Odette, according to a declaration from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council.Ensuring physical and mental well-beingAmazon has extended its group medical insurance to ensure that associates are able to get relevant medical treatments for any aliments or injuries sustained due to the typhoon. The typhoon’s impact on the mental health of our community is also of utmost importance to us, so Amazon has extended our Employee Assistance Program to provide our associates and their loved ones with free and confidential support, resources, and counseling.Employees coming togetherAmazon teams in Manila have been collecting essential supplies—food items, toiletries, and drinking water—and helping deliver them to affected colleagues in Cebu. Realizing the need for access to cash, teams also worked with Amazon’s local bank partner to temporarily station a mobile ATM in Amazon’s Cebu office for cash withdrawal.
















































Partnerships with nonprofits to drive relief effortsWe recognize the support given to us by the communities in which we operate. We have partnered with two organizations, Gawad Kalinga and the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation, to provide monetary support to drive their relief efforts.Amazon's cash donation will contribute towards Gawad Kalinga's goal of rebuilding 5,000 homes. The organization will also provide over 2,500 relief kits containing food, hygiene items, sleeping mats, and other essentials.""We are grateful to Amazon and their employees for extending support to our relief efforts. When such disasters hit us, most of the focus is placed on alleviating short-term, immediate issues,"" said Dan Bercasio, executive director of Gawad Kalinga. ""While that is a critical component, it is also important for us to act on the longer-term relief efforts such as housing and livelihood to help the victims get back on their feet sooner after such a devasting event.""






Typhoon Rai/Odette leaves behind shattered homes in Surigao del Norte, Philippines.

The Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation (PDRF) will use a cash donation from Amazon to provide high-quality shelter repair kits and support the local government in the early recovery phase of restoring public infrastructure. Amazon’s partnership with PDRF will directly support approximately 5,000 individuals. While those 5,000 Filipinos will receive direct assistance, the recovery efforts will also have a positive impact on up to 250,000 Filipinos.""PDRF’s partnership with Amazon has provided major support for our typhoon Odette (Rai) recovery initiatives. We are grateful to the company and its employees for their help during this critical time,"" said Rene Meily, president of PDRF.We invite you to join us in supporting these front-line organizations making a difference, or learn more about the impact of their work on our communities.

""Having Echo as my wingman, Danielle didn’t hesitate to say yes.""

We recently heard from Brent and Danielle, whose love story has a unique twist. They met, got to know one another, fell in love, and had their fairytale wedding—but unlike most love stories, Alexa was part of their story every step of the way.







Here is their story, in Brent’s words:The first dateWe think it’s kind of funny that Alexa was an ongoing part of our relationship—in fact, Danielle and I sometimes joke that Alexa is the only reason she came over to my house for our first date and is why we’re together.I had one of the original Echo devices, back when you had to be invited to purchase one. Danielle is a developer, and a big technology fan, so she wanted to get one. When she wasn’t selected, she learned I had one, she came over to my house to try it out.She spent part of our first date asking Alexa random questions, just to see how it reacted. She wanted to see if she could stump Alexa with questions, and wanted to explore the different things it could do.

The proposalAlexa was such a big part of our first date, so I knew when the time came to propose, Alexa had to be a part of it. I planned a vacation to Mexico, and I brought an Echo device along for the trip. I actually went out and bought the device just before the trip, and I remember Danielle even asking me why we needed another one.At home, we use Alexa on a daily basis, and part of our routine is listening to our morning flash briefing. Sneakily, I had built a flash briefing skill that linked to a blog post I wrote. That blog post contained my proposal.When the time was right, Danielle asked Alexa for the flash briefing, and Alexa started speaking. It started off like a regular flash briefing—but it started getting specific. I was trying to play it cool, and we were both sort of just looking at our phones, listening to Alexa in the background. However, as Alexa kept speaking, it started to recount our history as a couple, playing music that was special to us, and telling inside jokes. It took Danielle a few minutes, but she soon realized what was happening.She was so excited—she quickly said yes, and then she immediately asked Alexa to start the flash briefing over again. She’d only been half paying attention, expecting her usual flash briefing, so of course we needed to hear it again!Having Echo as my wingman, Danielle didn’t hesitate to say yes.The wedding







When our wedding came around, it only made sense for Alexa to be a part of it.We were brainstorming ways that Alexa could be a part of our special day. Eventually, we decided that the best place for Alexa on our wedding day was as our cake topper. We did a buffet of desserts, and standing in the middle of it all were two Echo devices we’d bought just for the occasion.  When the wedding was over, we gifted those two Echo devices to our best man and maid of honor, as a thank you for standing with us on the big day.The happily ever afterWe have several Echo devices and supporting smart devices, like lights and Fire TV, all around our home. Our favorite is still the Echo, which has become a bit of a fun, ongoing theme for us as a couple.We regularly use Alexa in our daily lives. We always look forward to new Alexa-enabled devices and the possibilities they can bring to our smart home automation and quality of life.We love that Alexa could be an important part of Brent and Danielle’s love story—and beyond.
