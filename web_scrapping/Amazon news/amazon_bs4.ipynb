       "  '\\n\\n\\nAmazon has been working closely with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to rapidly expand access to online grocery shopping to Americans who rely on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits across the country.\\n\\nAs families across the country were encouraged to stay home, Amazon worked closely with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to rapidly expand access to online grocery shopping to Americans who rely on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. What launched in 2019 as a pilot for expansion into only 10 states has quickly fast-tracked to a nearly national program in order to meet the evolving needs of customers, both during and after the COVID-19 crisis. Amazon now reaches beneficiaries in 48 states plus the District of Columbia, providing more than 99% of SNAP households1 with the ability to use their SNAP benefits online. Amazon volunteered to participate as a retailer in the USDA’s SNAP Online Purchasing Pilot in 2016 because we believe in its goals and to ensure that all customers have the opportunity to order groceries online.SNAP recipients in Alabama, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming can now use their benefits to shop for groceries on Amazon and other participating retailers—and we are working to expand access to additional states.With online acceptance of SNAP, Amazon’s selection, competitive pricing, and home delivery can improve the grocery shopping experience for SNAP participants. Customers can shop for groceries across two Amazon services: Amazon Grocery (shelf-stable food and household items in varying sizes), and Amazon Fresh (fresh produce, meat, and more; available in select metropolitan regions)—all with free shipping available. Amazon has waived the Prime membership requirement for SNAP customers to access Amazon Fresh, further reducing barriers to online grocery shopping.For further insight into the impact of online SNAP purchasing, we spoke with three leading hunger relief organizations fighting to end food insecurity\"SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, is our first line of defense against hunger by serving as a critical safety net for 1.6 million New Yorkers who struggle to make ends meet. By enabling SNAP EBT as a payment method online, low-income New Yorkers now have increased access to healthy food choices with the ability to purchase fresh produce and groceries for their families online.\" – Food Bank for New York City (FBNYC)\"The online SNAP purchasing pilot is one important piece of the puzzle for food access for low-income customers. It puts SNAP customers on an equal footing with other consumers and provides new options for them to get food into their hands. SNAP is one of our country’s most vital social safety nets and must continue to play a critical role in reducing hunger, malnutrition, and poverty. Online ordering is important in regular times but especially so when all Americans have been encouraged to practice social distancing and protect individual and public health. The pilot program helps vulnerable households gain greater access to healthy food while staying home.\" – Food Research and Action Center (FRAC)\"We are grateful the USDA has been so quick to approve states’ requests to make online SNAP purchases possible for their residents. Online SNAP is an incredibly powerful tool that makes it easier for SNAP recipients to purchase nutritious food, particularly for those who have challenges getting to a bricks-and-mortar store due to myriad barriers, including the unique challenges presented by the current COVID-19 public health crisis. We applaud USDA, the SNAP processors, and the many retailers who have responded to meet this demand in record time during unprecedented circumstances.\" – Alliance to End HungerAmazon is proud to continue to expand online SNAP acceptance to beneficiaries in more states and we remain committed to making food accessible through online grocery shopping, offering all customers convenience, time savings, and low prices delivered straight to their door.

       "  \"\\n\\n\\nAmazon Delivery Service Partners share their stories about getting into the business.\\n\\nFamily-owned and -operated small businesses are an important part of the U.S. economy. According to recent data from the U.S. Small Business Administration, nearly one-third of small employer businesses in the U.S. are family owned. As part of Amazon’s Delivery Service Partner (DSP) program, Amazon works with family-owned logistics and delivery businesses around the world to deliver packages to customers.Launched in 2018, the Amazon DSP program connects aspiring entrepreneurs with resources and coaching to help them build and scale their own businesses with Amazon. Today, Amazon partners with more than 3,000 DSPs globally that employ thousands of drivers and deliver for Amazon customers every day.Aimkhan Logistics and Total Package Logistics are two successful family-owned and women-led DSPs who have grown their businesses with Amazon. These DSP owners share their stories of how they got into business with their spouses, running their companies like family, and what their kids think of their parents’ entrepreneurial journeys.Maha Al-Absi and Aqeel Ahmed, owners of Aimkhan Logistics, Worcester, Massachusetts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMaha Al-Absi and Aqeel Ahmed spent most of their 20-plus-year careers in the corporate world working as certified project managers at large aerospace and insurance companies. Highly accomplished in their fields, they enjoyed their work. But they frequently discussed their own entrepreneurial ideas at the dinner table and how they could go into business together as a team one day.“I had always talked about starting a logistics business, since 2011 in fact,” said Ahmed. “The world is moving more and more online, and it was always something I thought I could do, but I never took the initiative.”That’s where Al-Absi stepped in. “It was February 2020, and Aqeel and a friend were talking—again—about logistics businesses. I remember because it was my birthday,” Al-Absi said. “After all this talk and no action, I said ‘Fine, if you’re just going to talk about it, I’m going to do something about it!’”Al-Absi applied for Amazon’s DSP program and was accepted. “I told Aqeel he had to run the business with me.”Al-Absi and Ahmed launched their business in August 2020, during the height of the pandemic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon, Delivered: Meet four women leading in logistics\\n\\nInside Amazon delivery stations and out on the road, women are a driving force in the company’s middle and last mile logistics. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“We set up the home office in our living room right next to our children, who were doing remote learning. We say that they got their MBAs during that time.” Parents to three kids, the two joke that they now have upward of 60 kids, having expanded from five drivers when they started their business with Amazon to more than 65 drivers today.“Our drivers and employees are like our family. They know our kids; our kids know them. We support them and guide them like we would our own children,” Ahmed said. “We opened our business to help people. Not just to earn money, but to change people’s lives. We mentor our drivers and encourage them to move on to bigger things in their lives.”At the end of the day, they see their business as a stepping stone for their employees.“We can provide our employees access, guidance, and support so they can learn how to become managers themselves and move up in their careers,” Al-Absi said.For some, that means graduating college and paying off student loans. For others, it means becoming financially independent and moving into homes or apartments of their own.“At the end of the day, this is a family business, and we want our employees to achieve their goals and dreams, just like we desire for our children,” Al-Absi said.Alison and Greg Gatto, owners of Total Package Logistics, Boca Raton, Florida\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLike Al-Absi, Alison Gatto acted on her husband’s curiosity and became an entrepreneur and DSP owner somewhat by accident.Gatto was living her dream of owning a successful luxury salon in Florida in 2018. She’d opened the salon 10 years earlier and had grown a staff and clientele that she was immensely proud of. A decade into living her dream, a chance conversation with her husband changed her life.“He had heard about this program with Amazon to open a small delivery business, and I just thought it sounded like something I’d be good at. Even though I didn’t know anything about logistics, I knew a lot about managing people,” she said. “I didn’t realize how much it would positively change the course of my life.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon, Delivered: From survivor to inspirational entrepreneur\\n\\nA difficult past didn’t stop Amazon Delivery Service Partner Sophia Strother from realizing her potential, while inspiring others. Find out how Strother became a thriving business leader, entrepreneur, and community advocate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGatto applied and was accepted into the DSP program and soon found herself launching a new business endeavor in an industry that she knew little about. Together, she and her husband Greg learned as much as they could about logistics and found that running a delivery business was not too dissimilar from running the many other businesses–including a burger restaurant–they’d owned over the course of their marriage.“The great thing about working with your spouse or partner is that you know their quirks, their strengths, and if you know how to communicate with each other, you can work well together,” she said. “I leave the manual labor and repairs to him; he leaves the operations to me!”“Both my husband and I are very entrepreneurial,” she said. “He’s always been self-employed and encouraged me to live out my dream of starting and owning businesses as well.”Gatto’s three daughters think what their mom is doing is pretty neat.“My middle daughter is 15 years old, and she’s taken an interest in the business. She’ll come into my office when I’m doing paperwork or planning and want to know more about it. To see that budding interest in entrepreneurship is an incredible thing to witness, and for her to see her parents helping each other succeed in business is an example I’m proud of.”Amazon is investing in the future, constantly finding new ways to empower employees and partners to succeed.
