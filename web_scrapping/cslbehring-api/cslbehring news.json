Etranacogene dezaparvovec is an investigational adeno-associated virus five (AAV5)-based gene therapy administered as a one-time treatment for hemophilia B patients with a severe bleeding phenotype. If approved, etranacogene dezaparvovec will provide people living with hemophilia B in the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) with the first-ever gene therapy treatment option that significantly reduces the rate of annual bleeds after a single infusion. Accelerated assessment potentially reduces the timeline once the MAA is accepted for review and is provided for a medicinal product when the therapy is expected to be of major public health interest, particularly pertaining to therapeutic innovation.    \u201cAs the first gene therapy candidate for hemophilia B, this pivotal regulatory milestone brings CSL Behring one step closer to delivering on the promise of gene therapy for the bleeding disorders community,\u201d said Emmanuelle Lecomte Brisset, Head of Global Regulatory Affairs at CSL Behring. \u201cWe look forward to working with regulatory authorities to bring the transformative potential of gene therapy to people living with this debilitating, life-long condition.\u201d   The MMA is supported by positive findings from the pivotal HOPE-B trial, the largest gene therapy trial in hemophilia B to date. Hemophilia B patients classified as having a severe bleeding phenotype treated with etranacogene dezaparvovec demonstrated reduced adjusted annualized bleed rate (ABR) by 64% and demonstrated superiority to prophylaxis treatment at 18 months post-treatment compared to a 6-month run in period. Additionally, there was stable and durable increases in mean Factor IX (FIX) activity levels. Etranacogene dezaparvovec was specifically designed to make near-normal blood-clotting ability possible by addressing the underlying cause of the condition: a faulty F9 gene that causes a deficiency in clotting Factor IX (FIX).   \u201cThe acceptance of etranacogene dezaparvovec for review by the EMA furthers our relentless pursuit to improve the lives and well-being of those living with hemophilia B and other rare and serious medical disorders,\u201d said Bill Mezzanotte, Executive Vice President, Head of R&D and Chief Medical Officer for CSL Limited. \u201cWe are proud to work with uniQure to be at the forefront of this scientific advancement which aims to make hemophilia B a secondary part of a patient\u2019s life instead of a constant concern.\u201d   The multi-year clinical development was led by uniQure (Nasdaq: QURE) and sponsorship of the clinical trials in the United States has transitioned to CSL Behring after its acquiring global rights to commercialize etranacogene dezaparvovec. CSL Behring is in the process of transitioning sponsorship of the clinical trials in the European Union.   About Hemophilia B Hemophilia B is a life-threatening degenerative disease. People with the condition are particularly vulnerable to bleeds in their joints, muscles, and internal organs, leading to pain, swelling, and joint damage. Current treatment includes life-long prophylactic infusions of FIX to temporarily replace or supplement low levels of the blood-clotting factor.   About Hemophilia B Hemophilia B is a life-threatening degenerative disease. People with the condition are particularly vulnerable to bleeds in their joints, muscles, and internal organs, leading to pain, swelling, and joint damage. Current treatment includes life-long prophylactic infusions of FIX to temporarily replace or supplement low levels of the blood-clotting factor.   About Gene Therapy in Hemophilia B Gene therapy has the potential to make a functional cure possible in hemophilia B.  Gene therapy achieves this with modified non-infectious viruses called \u201cvectors\u201d that can enter certain cells.  Vectors carry genetic instructions to specific cells. Once delivered, the new genetic instructions allow the cellular machinery to produce their own stable levels of FIX. A certain type of vector, called an adeno-associated virus, or AAV, dissolves after delivering its genetic instructions. These genetic instructions remain in the target cells, but never actually become a part of a person\u2019s own DNA.   About Etranacogene Dezaparvovec Etranacogene dezaparvovec (also known as CSL222, previously known as AMT-061) uses a specific type of AAV, called AAV5, as its vector. The AAV5 vector carries the Padua gene variant of Factor IX (FIX-Padua), which generates FIX proteins that are 5x-8x more active than normal. Preclinical and clinical data show that AAV5-based gene therapies may be clinically effective in up to 95 percent of hemophilia B patients with pre-existing antibodies to AAV vectors, thereby potentially increasing patient eligibility for treatment compared to other AAV gene therapy product candidates.   About the Pivotal HOPE-B Trial The pivotal Phase III HOPE-B trial is a multinational, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of etranacogene dezaparvovec. Fifty-four adult hemophilia B patients classified as having a severe bleeding phenotype and requiring prophylactic FIX replacement therapy were enrolled in a prospective, six-month observational period during which time they continued to use their current standard of care therapy to establish a baseline Annual Bleeding Rate (ABR). After the six-month lead-in period, patients received a single intravenous administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec at the 2x10^13 gc\/kg dose. Patients were not excluded from the trial based on pre-existing neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to AAV5. A total of 54 patients received a single dose of etranacogene dezaparvovec in the pivotal trial, with 53 patients completing at least 18 months of follow-up. The primary endpoint in the pivotal HOPE-B study was 52-week ABR after achievement of stable FIX expression compared with the six-month lead-in period. For this endpoint, ABR was measured from month seven to month 18 after infusion, ensuring the observation period represented a steady-state FIX transgene expression. Secondary endpoints included assessment of FIX activity and statistical superiority of ABR after dosing.  Results from the pivotal HOPE-B study demonstrated that etranacogene dezaparvovec produced mean FIX activity of 39.0 IU\/dL at six months and 36.9 IU\/dL at 18 months post infusion. After the six-month lead-in period post-infusion, the adjusted annualized bleeding rate (ABR) (1.51) for all bleeds was reduced by 64 percent (p=0.0002) and all FIX-treated bleeds was reduced by 77 percent (3.65 to 0.83; p<0.0001) over months seven to 18. In addition, 98 percent of subjects treated with a full dose of etranacogene dezaparvovec discontinued use of prophylaxis, with an overall 97 percent reduction in mean unadjusted annualized FIX consumption of 257338.8 IU\/yr\/participant to 8486.6 IU\/yr\/participant  (from lead-in period to months 13-18).  Etranacogene dezaparvovec is generally well-tolerated with the majority of adverse events (80.4 percent) considered mild. One death resulting from urosepsis and cardiogenic shock in a 77-year-old patient at 65 weeks following dosing was considered unrelated to treatment by investigators and the company sponsor. A serious adverse event of hepatocellular carcinoma was determined to be unrelated to treatment with etranacogene dezaparvovec by independent molecular tumor characterization and vector integration analysis. No inhibitors to FIX were reported.  About CSL Behring CSL Behring is a global biotherapeutics leader driven by our promise to save lives.

Following a single infusion of etranacogene dezaparvovec, participants experienced a stable and durable increase in mean Factor IX (FIX) activity and hemostatic protection at 18 months. The final data, from the largest gene therapy study in hemophilia B, were presented as part of the latest clinical trial results session at the European Association of Haemophilia and Allied Disorders (EAHAD) 2022 Annual Meeting.  \u201cThe final 18-month results from the pivotal HOPE-B study continue to establish the durability of etranacogene dezaparvovec gene therapy, which produced Factor IX levels that remained stable and consistent over the course of the study, while also significantly reducing the rate of annual bleeds after a single infusion,\u201d said Professor Wolfgang Miesbach, Head of the Department of Coagulation Disorders and the Comprehensive Care Centre from the University Hospital of Frankfurt, Germany, and an investigator for the HOPE-B trial. \u201cHemophilia B, like many other genetic diseases, is an ideal target for gene therapy because the disease stems from a single faulty gene, making its replacement with a fully functional F9 gene a robust therapeutic intervention.\u201d Key Data from the Phase 3 HOPE-B Study  The Phase 3, open label, single-dose, single arm HOPE-B trial, which included 54 male participants with severe or moderately severe hemophilia B, demonstrated that etranacogene dezaparvovec produced mean FIX activity of 39.0 IU\/dL at six months and 36.9 IU\/dL at 18 months post infusion. After the six-month lead-in period post-infusion, the adjusted annualized bleeding rate (ABR) (1.51) for all bleeds was reduced by 64 percent (p=0.0002) and all FIX-treated bleeds was reduced by 77 percent (3.65 to 0.83; p<0.0001) over months seven to 18. In addition, 98 percent of subjects treated with a full dose of etranacogene dezaparvovec discontinued use of prophylaxis, with an overall 97 percent reduction in mean unadjusted annualized FIX consumption of 257338.8 IU\/yr\/participant to 8486.6 IU\/yr\/participant (from lead-in period to months 13-18).  \u201cWhile progress in today\u2019s FIX prophylaxis treatments has made meaningful improvements in the lives of people with hemophilia B, many patients remain at risk of serious bleeds and other complications, despite regular, ongoing treatment,\u201d said Steven Pipe, M.D., Professor of Pediatrics and Pathology and Pediatric Medical Director of the Hemophilia and Coagulation Disorders Program at the University of Michigan, and the principal investigator of the HOPE-B trial. \u201cNearly all patients treated with gene therapy in this study were able to discontinue use of prophylaxis. The treatment was also effective in people who have pre-existing neutralizing antibodies, which would typically disqualify someone from this kind of treatment.\u201d Etranacogene dezaparvovec is generally well-tolerated with the majority of adverse events (80.4 percent) considered mild. One death resulting from urosepsis and cardiogenic shock in a 77-year-old patient at 65 -weeks following dosing was considered unrelated to treatment by investigators and the company sponsor. A serious adverse event of hepatocellular carcinoma was determined, by independent molecular tumor characterization and vector integration analysis, to be unrelated to treatment with etranacogene dezaparvovec. No inhibitors to FIX were reported. \u201cThe gene therapy platform builds on CSL Behring\u2019s decades-long promise to improve the lives and well-being of people with hemophilia B, and the most recent data from the pivotal HOPE-B study demonstrates the transformative potential of this platform to further redefine how we treat this life-long condition,\u201d said CSL Behring\u2019s Vice President, Hematology Research and Development Brahm Goldstein, MD, MCR, \u201cWith this positive data and accelerated regulatory review pathways in the U.S. and in Europe, we look forward to expanding on the foundational work done by our partner, uniQure and working closely with regulatory authorities to bring the potentially life-changing benefits of gene therapy to the hemophilia B community.\u201d In addition to the presentation of the HOPE-B findings, the e-posters \u201cMultiple-Year Durability Data From A Phase 2B Trial Of Gene Therapy With Etranacogene Dezaparvovec In Patients With Hemophilia B\u201d [PO098] and \u201cUnmet Needs in Hemophilia B: Perspectives From People Living With Hemophilia B, Healthcare Professionals and the Healthcare Industry\u201d [PO142] were also shared.  About the Phase 3 HOPE-B Study  The pivotal Phase III HOPE-B trial is a multinational, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of\u00a0etranacogene dezaparvovec. Fifty-four adult hemophilia B patients classified as severe or moderately severe\u00a0(defined as less than or equal to 2 percent of normal FIX activity) and requiring prophylactic FIX replacement therapy\u00a0were enrolled in a\u00a0prospective,\u00a0six-month observational period during which time they continued to use their current standard of care therapy to establish a baseline\u00a0ABR. No prophylactic immunosuppression was provided to patients upon entering the study. After the six-month lead-in period, patients received a single intravenous administration of\u00a0etranacogene dezaparvovec at the 2x10^13\u00a0gc\/kg dose.\u00a0Patients were not excluded from the trial based on pre-existing\u00a0neutralizing antibodies (NAbs)\u00a0to AAV5. A total of 54 patients received a single dose of etranacogene dezaparvovec in the pivotal trial, with 53 patients completing at least 18 months of follow-up. The primary endpoint in the pivotal HOPE-B study was 52-week ABR after achievement of stable FIX expression compared with the six-month lead-in period, considering all bleeds regardless of investigator adjudication as true bleeds.\u00a0For this endpoint, ABR was measured from month seven to month 18 after infusion, ensuring the observation period represented likely steady-state FIX transgene expression. Secondary endpoints included assessment of FIX activity and statistical superiority of ABR after dosing. The multi-year clinical development for etranacogene dezaparvovec is being jointly led by CSL Behring and uniQure (Nasdaq: QURE). CSL Behring acquired global rights to commercialize etranacogene dezaparvovec in May 2021.  About Hemophilia B Hemophilia B is a life-threatening degenerative disease. People with the condition are particularly vulnerable to bleeds in their muscles, internal organs, and joints, leading to pain, swelling, and joint damage. Current treatment includes life-long prophylactic infusions of FIX to temporarily replace or supplement low levels of the blood-clotting factor. This can reduce joint bleeding events, prevent life-threatening bleeds, and preserve joint function. However, infusions can be cumbersome, painful and veins can fibrose over time, making ongoing treatment difficult. A person\u2019s immune system may also generate inhibitors against the replacement factor, negating its benefit. In addition, many people receiving prophylaxis are forced to plan their lives around the highs and lows of their FIX levels, which rise immediately after an infusion but drop over time -- leaving them especially vulnerable to bleeds and pain in the days before their next infusion. Most troubling, prophylactic FIX replacement therapy sometimes fails to control unobservable micro-bleeds in the joints, meaning that the degeneration can continue despite regular infusions. Missing an infusion may also the increase their likelihood of a life-threatening bleed or even premature death.  About Gene Therapy in Hemophilia B Gene therapy has the potential to make a functional cure possible in hemophilia B.\u00a0 Gene therapy achieves this with modified non-infectious viruses called \u201cvectors\u201d that can enter certain cells.\u00a0 Vectors act as delivery trucks, carrying a package of genetic instructions to specific cells. Once delivered, the package acts like a generator that plugs into the cellular machinery, allowing a person to produce their own stable levels of FIX. A certain type of vector, called an adeno-associated virus, or AAV, dissolves after delivering its package. The genetic instructions remain, but never actually become a part of a person\u2019s own DNA. About Etranacogene Dezaparvovec Etranacogene dezaparvovec (also known as CSL222, previously known as AMT-061) uses a specific type of AAV, called AAV5, as its delivery vehicle. The AAV5 vector carries the Padua gene variant of Factor IX (FIX-Padua), which generates FIX proteins that are 5x-8x more active than normal. Preclinical and clinical data show that AAV5-based gene therapies may be clinically effective in up to 95 percent of hemophilia B patients with pre-existing antibodies to AAV vectors, thereby potentially increasing patient eligibility for treatment compared to other AAV gene therapy product candidates.

Amongst its highlights, the company plans to initiate a phase 3 study of 4-Factor Prothrombin Complex Concentrate to improve survival in traumatic injury and acute major bleeding, a leading cause of death. In the company\u2019s VANGUARD Phase 3 clinical trial for Garadacimab, a monoclonal antibody treatment for hereditary angioedema (HAE), the last patient was enrolled two months ahead of schedule. CSL also progressed recruitment for the AEGIS-II Phase 3 study of CSL112 (ApoA-1) for treatment of acute coronary syndrome despite COVID-19 impact on clinical trial sites and patients. To date, more than 14,000 people have been enrolled in this study. \u201cWe continue to evolve as a leading plasma-based biotechnology company with purposeful diversity in therapeutic areas, scientific platforms and strategic alliances,\u201d said Dr. Bill Mezzanotte, Executive Vice President, Head of R&D, Chief Medical Officer for CSL. \u201cWe are continuing to invest in our core plasma business while also enhancing our other scientific platforms to better deliver on our promise to discover, develop and provide innovations that save and improve lives around the world.\u201d The company\u2019s Seqirus business, a global leader in influenza prevention, highlighted its R&D investments in its first-of-its-kind adjuvanted, cell-based seasonal influenza vaccine (aQIVc) and next-generation self-amplifying mRNA for seasonal and pandemic influenza (sa-mRNA). \u00a0Earlier this month, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a division of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), awarded Seqirus a multi-year contract to develop two influenza A (H2Nx) vaccine candidates for assessment in a Phase 1 clinical study with the goal of helping to safeguard communities in the event of an influenza pandemic. Other Seqirus highlights for aQIVc \u2013 which combines two leading-edge technologies \u2013 the company\u2019s proprietary MF59\u00ae adjuvant and cell-based vaccine manufacturing \u2013 included:  Phase 2 study is ongoing with plans to initiate the Phase 3 clinical trial of this promising vaccine candidate in the second half of 2022. \u00a0 Both adjuvanted and cell-based influenza vaccines have potential benefits in seasonal influenza vaccine programs compared with more traditional manufacturing methods. Combining the technologies may elicit a greater immune response and potentially result in increased vaccine efficacy, particularly in the older adult population.  Other highlights for the development of Seqirus\u2019 next-generation sa-mRNA vaccine technology for seasonal and pandemic influenza included:   Progressing sa-mRNA-based influenza vaccine candidates, with pre-clinical results demonstrating potential.  Targeting the commencement of clinical trials for both seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine candidates in the second half of 2022.  \u201cWe are deeply invested in evolving the vaccine landscape to create new, more effective ways of protecting our communities against both seasonal and pandemic influenza,\u201d said Dr. Russell Basser, Senior Vice President of R&D at Seqirus. \u201cAs a partner in public health, our job is to determine how best to utilize and expand our capabilities to deliver improved and inspired solutions.

From the time the coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan, China \u2013 where CSL Behring has a manufacturing facility \u2013 the company has been assisting in the fight against COVID-19 in a number of ways, including offering expertise, resources, technologies, equipment and materials on a humanitarian basis. As the challenges grow and evolve from the pandemic, we continue to respond.\u00a0  We are proud to share our efforts:       In 2020, CSL worked with the University of Queensland in the early stages of its UQ-CSL v451 COVID-19 vaccine candidate. A Phase I clinical trial showed that the vaccine elicited a robust response towards the virus and had a strong safety profile. However, following consultation with the Australian Government, CSL did not progress the vaccine candidate to Phase II or Phase III clinical trials due to the partial immune response causing an unexpected interference with certain HIV testing procedures. It was agreed the changes required to well-established HIV testing procedures in the healthcare setting, to accommodate the rollout of this vaccine, were too significant in the given timeframe. CSL rapidly established dedicated COVID-19 vaccine teams across its business units and transitioned elements of its Australian manufacturing capacity, at both our CSL Behring Broadmeadows and Seqirus Parkville facilities, to manufacture 50 million doses of AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine for local use. First doses were rolled out in March 2021 with over 10 million doses released at the end of June 2021. Seqirus has provided its well-established adjuvant technology \u2013 MF59\u00ae \u2013 to the vaccine efforts of multiple entities, including the University of Queensland vaccine development program. MF59\u00ae is used in CSL\u2019s adjuvanted seasonal flu vaccine for the over-65 age group, one of the most vulnerable populations to COVID-19. Adjuvants can help improve immune response and reduce the amount of antigen needed for each vaccine, enabling more doses to be manufactured more rapidly. In parallel, Seqirus remains focused on the production of seasonal influenza vaccines, the importance of which is very much underscored by the COVID-19 pandemic. CSL Behring launched a clinical trial into the use of garadacimab (CSL312), our factor XIIa antagonist monoclonal antibody, to treat patients suffering from severe respiratory distress, a leading cause of death in patients with COVID-19\u2013related pneumonia. A Phase II trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the potential treatment was rapidly completed; and whilst garadacimab was found to be safe for these critically ill patients, the treatment was not effective in reducing severe complications of COVID-19. CSL is evaluating additional assets in its portfolio, and partnerships with external researchers, for potential use in the fight against COVID-19. Our acumen and expertise across vaccine, monoclonal antibody, recombinant and plasma technology platforms, our manufacturing capabilities and partnerships, along with a therapeutic focus in immunology and respiratory, all align with the scope of this disease and, most importantly, our ability to contribute to the development of potential vaccines and treatments. CSL Behring co-founded the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance, an unprecedented industry of 11 plasma companies across 13+ countries and five continents, to develop a potential plasma-derived hyperimmune therapy for treating COVID-19. The one-year collaboration concluded in April 2021 after a Phase III clinical trial of the potential therapy did not meet its endpoints. In addition, CSL\u2019s work on an Australian hyperimmune, which was dependent on positive data, has also been discontinued.\u00a0  About CSL  CSL (ASX:CSL; USOTC:CSLLY) is a leading global biotechnology company with a dynamic portfolio of life-saving medicines, including those that treat hemophilia and immune deficiencies, as well as vaccines to prevent influenza.

The new guideline includes evidence-based recommendations for the use of subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg) for maintenance treatment in CIDP.  Previously released in 2010 prior to the approval of SCIg for the treatment of CIDP, this guideline update is significant as it marks the first update to include an evaluation for SCIg. The Task Force strongly recommended the use of SCIg for maintenance treatment in CIDP while expressing no preference for either intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) or SCIg for maintenance treatment in CIDP. The guideline was published online in both the Journal of the Peripheral Nervous System and the European Journal of Neurology. The presentation highlighting the new guideline can be viewed here. \u201cThe updated guideline should provide physicians with the confidence to recommend subcutaneous immune globulin as an effective, safe and evidence-based treatment option for their patients,\u201d said Peter Van den Bergh, M.D., Professor of Neurology, FEAN, FAAN, Coordinator of the Neuromuscular Reference Centre at the University Hospital Saint-Luc in Brussels, Belgium. \u201cSCIg can offer CIDP patients the convenience of self-infusing their treatment at home with no IV access necessary, and potentially fewer systemic side effects.\u201d CSL Behring's Hizentra\u00ae (Immune Globulin Subcutaneous [Human] 20% Liquid) is the most prescribed SCIg treatment and the first and only SCIg treatment approved for CIDP. In 2020, as part of its ongoing efforts to provide patients with convenient and flexible treatment options, CSL Behring introduced the first and only Ig in simple, ready-to-use prefilled syringes. \u201cWe commend the EAN and PNS Task Force for updating the guideline to include additional treatment options that may benefit the CIDP community,\u201d said Andrew Koenig, D.O., Global Therapy Area Lead, Global Medical Affairs, Immunology, CSL Behring. \u201cAt CSL Behring, we are driven by our promise to provide patients with the best possible care, and we believe this recommendation allows CIDP patients to have more control in managing their condition.\u201d The updated guideline also states that the SCIg dose should be tailored according to individual treatment response. Additionally, the EAN\/PNS Task Force recommended against using SCIg for induction treatment in CIDP, which is consistent with Hizentra's label, as it states therapy with Hizentra should be initiated 1 week after a patient's last IVIg infusion. About CIDP CIDP is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nerves (those outside the brain and spinal cord) and damages the protective covering of the nerves known as the myelin sheath. This may result in numbness or tingling, muscle weakness, fatigue and other symptoms. CIDP effects can worsen over time, leading to significant activity limitations and a decreased quality of life. CIDP can occur at any age and is more common in men than in women. The GBS|CIDP Foundation estimates that approximately 30 percent of CIDP patients progress to wheelchair dependence if not treated. About Hizentra\u00ae  Registered in more than 60 countries, Hizentra is the world's most prescribed subcutaneous immunoglobulin for primary immunodeficiency (PI), with more than 9.3 million exposures worldwide since 2010. It has a proven track record of safety, efficacy, and tolerability. Hizentra was first approved by the U.S. FDA in March 2010, followed by the European Medicines Authority (EMA) in 2011, for the treatment of patients with PI. Hizentra was approved by both the U.S. FDA and EMA in 2018 for the treatment of adults with CIDP to prevent relapse of neuromuscular disability and impairment. For more information about Hizentra, including the full prescribing information, www.hizentra.com.  IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Hizentra\u00ae, Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human), 20% Liquid, is a prescription medicine used to treat:  Primary immune deficiency (PI) in patients 2 years and older Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) in adults  WARNING: Thrombosis (blood clots) can occur with immune globulin products, including Hizentra. Risk factors can include: advanced age, prolonged immobilization, a history of blood clotting or hyperviscosity (blood thickness), use of estrogens, installed vascular catheters, and cardiovascular risk factors. If you are at high risk of blood clots, your doctor will prescribe Hizentra at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable and will monitor for signs of clotting events and hyperviscosity. Always drink sufficient fluids before infusing Hizentra. See your doctor for a full explanation, and the full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Treatment with Hizentra might not be possible if your doctor determines you have hyperprolinemia (too much proline in the blood), or are IgA-deficient with antibodies to IgA and a history of hypersensitivity. Tell your doctor if you have previously had a severe allergic reaction (including anaphylaxis) to the administration of human immune globulin. Tell your doctor right away or go to the emergency room if you have hives, trouble breathing, wheezing, dizziness, or fainting. These could be signs of a bad allergic reaction. Inform your doctor of any medications you are taking, as well as any medical conditions you may have had, especially if you have a history of diseases related to the heart or blood vessels, or have been immobile for some time. Inform your physician if you are pregnant or nursing, or plan to become pregnant. Infuse Hizentra under your skin only; do not inject into a blood vessel. Self-administer Hizentra only after having been taught to do so by your doctor or other healthcare professional, and having received dosing instructions for treating your condition.

HAE is a rare, genetic and potentially life-threatening condition that causes painful, potentially debilitating and unpredictable episodes of swelling of the abdomen, larynx, face and extremities, among other areas of the body. HAE is caused by deficient or dysfunctional C1-INH, a protein in the blood that helps to control swelling.  \u201cHAE affects my life daily; with the concerns and stress of not only maintaining my own health as a patient, but also that of my child who also has HAE,\u201d said Machelle, a person living with HAE. \u201cRegardless of being on a preventive therapy or not, being prepared to rapidly treat an HAE attack is of utmost importance\u201d.\u00a0 BERINERT is the only C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) approved to treat acute abdominal, facial, or laryngeal HAE attacks in adults and pediatric patients.\u00a0 In accordance with the World Allergy Organization Guidelines for the Management of HAE, it is recommended that all patients have sufficient medication for on-demand treatment of two attacks and carry on-demand medication at all times.  Combination product packaging will now include a 10 mL silicone-free syringe as well as an IV set and butterfly needle and is anticipated to be in-market within the third quarter of 2021.\u00a0\u00a0  About BERINERT BERINERT is a plasma-derived C1 Esterase Inhibitor (Human) indicated for the treatment of acute abdominal, facial, or laryngeal attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks in adult and pediatric patients. The safety and efficacy of BERINERT in preventing HAE attacks have not been established.  CSL Behring has marketed its C1 Esterase Inhibitor concentrate, BERINERT, in Germany for more than 30 years. The product is also approved and marketed in more than 20 European countries, the United States, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan and South Korea.  Important Safety Information  BERINERT\u00ae, C1 Esterase Inhibitor (Human), is contraindicated in individuals with a history of life-threatening systemic reactions to C1 esterase inhibitor preparations (including anaphylaxis).  Monitor patients for early signs of allergic or hypersensitivity reactions (including hives, generalized urticaria, chest tightness, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis). If hypersensitivity is suspected, immediately discontinue administration of BERINERT and initiate appropriate treatment. Epinephrine should be immediately available for treatment of acute severe hypersensitivity reactions.  Serious arterial and venous thromboembolic (TE) events have been reported following administration of recommended doses of C1 Esterase Inhibitor (Human) products to patients with HAE. Risk factors may include presence of an indwelling venous catheter\/access device; prior history of thrombosis; underlying atherosclerosis; use of oral contraceptives or certain androgens; morbid obesity; and immobility. Weigh benefits\/risks before administering to patients with known risk factors for TE events and closely monitor such patients during and after BERINERT administration. TE events also have been reported with C1 Esterase Inhibitor (Human) products when used for unapproved indications at higher than recommended doses.  Appropriately trained patients may self-administer BERINERT upon recognition of an HAE attack. Advise patients to seek medical attention immediately following self-administration for laryngeal attacks, and to seek medical attention if progress of any attack makes them unable to properly prepare or administer dose of BERINERT.  BERINERT is derived from human plasma. The risk of transmission of infectious agents, including viruses and theoretically, the agents of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) and its variant form (vCJD), cannot be completely eliminated.  The most serious adverse reaction reported in subjects who received BERINERT in clinical studies was an increase in severity of pain associated with HAE. Dysgeusia was the most common adverse reaction reported in over 4% of subjects and more frequently than in the placebo group.  BERINERT has not been evaluated in pregnant women or nursing mothers, and should be used only if clearly needed. In clinical trials, the half-life of BERINERT was shorter and clearance was faster in children than in adults; the clinical implication of this difference is not known.

The new coverage, which is effective for dates of service on or after July 18, 2021, will reduce out-of-pocket costs for patients and includes coverage of the self-infusion pump, supplies, medication and nurse training. Hizentra will be the only self-infusion treatment for CIDP covered under the same benefit category as other Ig CIDP treatment options.\u00a0  \u201cWe believe this decision by CMS is in the best interest of patients and will improve access to Hizentra, which is directly aligned with our purpose and a central part of our promise to patients,\u201d said Bob Lojewski, Senior Vice President and General Manager, North America, CSL Behring. \u201cThanks to CMS, patients will now experience reduced out-of-pocket costs and have better access to a therapy that gives them the flexibility to self-administer their treatment at a time, place and on a schedule that\u2019s convenient for them.\u201d  People living with CIDP require regular infusions of immune globulin replacement therapy to maintain their health. Prior to the CMS decision to cover Hizentra under Medicare Part B, Hizentra has been covered under Medicare Part D, meaning that many patients experience higher out-of-pocket costs associated with their treatment and certain medical equipment, such as the self-infusion pump. Patients with Medicare Part B and Medigap or supplemental coverage will see a significant reduction in out-of-pocket expenses as compared to Part D with this new coverage.  \u201cA large focus of the GBS|CIDP Foundation International is ensuring that policy decisions reflect the needs of our patient community and we believe decisions like this by CMS are a step in the right direction for the benefit of patients,\u201d said Lisa Butler, Executive Director, GBS|CIDP Foundation International. \u201cPeople with CIDP may face barriers in their day-to-day life, but access to treatment should not be one of them.\u201d  The referral process for Hizentra will now be easier for physicians, since no prior authorization will be required. CSL Behring also offers Hizentra ConnectSM, a comprehensive resource center for patients who need assistance applying for Medicare Part B coverage and for physicians who have questions regarding referral to specialty pharmacies, coding and billing, nurse training and financial assistance.\u00a0  \u201cIt is important to have an open dialogue with patients about treatment options,\u201d said Jeffrey Allen, M.D., Department of Neurology, Neuromuscular Medicine, University of Minnesota. \u201cNow that Hizentra will have the same Medicare coverage as an IVIg, physicians and patients may be able to more easily find the option that is best for them.\u201d\u00a0  About CIDP CIDP is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nerves (those outside the brain and spinal cord) and damages the protective covering of the nerves known as the myelin sheath.

The findings show that 49 percent of the recurrent major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) experienced in the first year following an ACS event occurred within the first 90 days. The results were presented at the American College of Cardiology\u2019s 70th Annual Scientific Session & Expo (ACC.21).\u00a0 ACS describes a range of conditions with clinically obstructive coronary disease, where unstable or vulnerable plaque erosion or rupture may block an artery and restrict blood flow to the heart.1,2 While it is largely understood that, despite optimal clinical therapy, patients with ACS are at a high risk of experiencing a recurrent cardiovascular (CV) event within one year, recent research suggests the first 90 days may be the most critical time period.3\u00a0 \u201cWhile we know that patients with ACS are always going to be vulnerable for future cardiovascular complications, what is striking is that when we look at all of the recurrent events that occur within one year after ACS, about half are happening within just the first 90 days,\u201d stated C. Michael Gibson, M.D., M.S., an interventional cardiologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and principal study investigator. \u201cThese data tell us that we need to look beyond our traditional 30-day window in clinical studies and address the underlying cause of these early recurrent events to help provide our patients with more protection.\u201d\u00a0 Researchers performed a comprehensive search to collect data from Phase 3 interventional trials on high-risk ACS patients. A total of 82,727 high-risk patients with recent ACS from the seven trials were analyzed. Pooled rates of recurrent MACE were 4.1 percent (95% CI: 3.0%-5.7%) at 90 days and 8.3 percent (95% CI: 7.1%-9.8%) at 360 days. Approximately 49 percent of events occurred within the first 90 days.\u00a0 \u201cThis meta-analysis reaffirms that the first 90 days after an ACS event are when patients are particularly vulnerable for recurrent MACE,\u201d said Larry Deckelbaum, Vice President, Research and Development, Cardiovascular and Metabolic Therapeutic Area at CSL Behring. \u201cDespite the treatment options available today, it is clear that more needs to be done to protect patients during this critical time period. That\u2019s why we\u2019re looking towards our novel Phase 3 research program to better understand this risk period and how we can deliver on our promise to patients and reduce the risk of these recurrent events.\u201d\u00a0 About AEGIS-II The AEGIS-II study is a Phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, which will enroll approximately 17,400 patients from 49 countries. It will evaluate the efficacy and safety of CSL112 compared to placebo in reducing the risk of MACE in patients following a heart attack. The primary efficacy outcome is time to the first occurrence of the MACE composite, which includes cardiovascular death, heart attack or stroke, from randomization through 90 days.

Etranacogene dezaparvovec is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials and has been shown\u00a0 to result in near-normal levels of Factor IX (FIX) \u2013 the blood clotting protein lacking in people with hemophilia B. CSL Behring has been recognized as a global hematology leader for decades.  The global licensing agreement was announced on June 24, 2020 and the closing follows the completion of antitrust reviews of the transaction in the US, the UK and Australia.\u00a0 Under the terms of the agreement, uniQure will receive an upfront cash payment of US$450 million, with the potential for regulatory and commercial sales milestone payments and royalties as the therapy is developed and commercialized. uniQure will complete the Phase 3 HOPE-B trial and scale up manufacture for initial commercial supply. \u201cWe are continuing to build on our legacy of delivering lifesaving innovations in hematology with today\u2019s news. This agreement enables us to take forward a gene therapy that, if approved, has the potential to transform the lives of hemophilia B patients, sharply reducing or eliminating bleeds and routine infusions, life-limiting restrictions, and the constant fear of debilitating injury when blood clotting levels are low,\u201d said CSL CEO Paul Perreault. \u201cEtranacogene dezaparvovec has the potential to be the first-ever gene therapy approved for hemophilia B and to help CSL Behring deliver on our ongoing commitment to improving the lives of those living with hemophilia B.\u201d  Gene therapy has the potential to be life-changing and transformative, offering functionally curative benefits to people with hemophilia B with years of functional FIX levels generated by their own bodies. \u201cHemophilia B patients live with the knowledge that they are at constant risk of bleeds, and that every bleed can mean that tissue or joints are irreparably damaged,\u201d said CSL Behring\u2019s Executive Vice President, Head of Research and Development and Chief Medical Officer Bill Mezzanotte, M.D., MPH. \u201cImagine what it might mean to be freed from that fear, secure in the knowledge that your self-generated FIX levels will be high enough to protect you today, tomorrow, and every day, ideally for years to come. This is the essence of great science bringing hope to patients.\u201d\u00a0  The acquisition complements both CSL Behring\u2019s cell and gene therapy scientific platform and its hematology product portfolio, which include other treatments for hemophilia B as well as therapies for treating hemophilia A, von Willebrand disease, thrombosis, and other life-threatening conditions. Current Results from the Etranacogene Dezaparvovec Clinical Program \u00a0 Ten participants in a Phase 1\/2 safety and dosing study were treated five years ago using AMT-060, a gene therapy highly similar to etranacogene dezaparvovec (AMT-061).\u00a0 AMT-061 uses the same delivery vehicle as AMT-060 but contains the high-activity Padua FIX gene instead of the FIX gene more commonly found in the general population.  As of December 2020, the latest report available, all 10 participants treated with AMT-060 continue to express stable FIX levels, have reduced usage of FIX replacement therapy, and have decreased bleeding frequency, demonstrating its long-lasting durability.  In December 2020, uniQure also announced that data from its Phase 2b dose-confirmation study of etranacogene dezaparvovec (AMT-061) showed that all three patients stabilized and sustained FIX activity at functional levels two years after a single dose \u2013 with increases in FIX activity of up to 51.6% of normal and a mean of 44.2%. Patients experienced zero bleeds and no longer needed routine prophylaxis with a FIX replacement therapy. \u00a0 The Phase 3 HOPE-B study currently underway includes 54 study participants, with FIX activity increasing to a mean of 37% at 26 weeks (reported November 19, 2020). In all but one patient, these improvements occurred irrespective of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies. FIX activity levels will be assessed again at 52-weeks (mid-2021) to confirm that activity levels stabilized over time as they did in the Phase 2b study. To date, no serious treatment-related adverse events have been reported in the clinical studies of etranacogene dezaparvovec or its predecessor AMT-060.\u00a0  About Hemophilia B Hemophilia B is a life-threatening degenerative disease. People with the condition are particularly vulnerable to bleeds in their muscles, internal organs, and joints, leading to pain, swelling, and joint damage. Current treatment includes life-long prophylactic infusions of FIX to temporarily replace or supplement low levels of the blood-clotting factor. This can reduce joint bleeding events, prevent life-threatening bleeds, and preserve joint function. However, infusions can be cumbersome, painful and veins can fibrose over time, making ongoing treatment difficult. A person\u2019s immune system may also generate inhibitors against the replacement factor, negating its benefit. In addition, many people receiving prophylaxis are forced to plan their lives around the highs and lows of their FIX levels, which rise immediately after an infusion but drop over time -- leaving them especially vulnerable to bleeds and pain in the days before their next infusion. Most troubling, prophylactic FIX replacement therapy sometimes fails to control unobservable micro-bleeds in the joints, meaning that the degeneration can continue despite regular infusions. Missing an infusion may also the increase their likelihood of a life-threatening bleed or even premature death.\u00a0  About Gene Therapy in Hemophilia B Gene therapy has the potential to make a functional cure possible in hemophilia B.\u00a0 Gene therapy achieves this with modified non-infectious viruses called \u201cvectors\u201d that can enter certain cells.\u00a0 Vectors act as delivery trucks, carrying a package of genetic instructions to specific cells. Once delivered, the package acts like a generator that plugs into the cellular machinery, allowing a person to produce their own stable and protective levels of FIX. \u00a0A certain type of vector, called an adeno-associated virus, or AAV, dissolves after delivering its package. The genetic instructions remain, but never actually become a part of a person\u2019s own DNA.  About Etranacogene Dezaparvovec Etranacogene dezaparvovec (also known as AMT-061) uses a specific type of AAV, called AAV5, as its delivery vehicle. The AAV5 vector carries the patent-protected Padua gene variant of Factor IX (FIX-Padua), which generates FIX proteins that work 8x harder than normal. Preclinical and clinical data show that AAV5-based gene therapies may be clinically effective in the 95 percent of hemophilia B patients with pre-existing antibodies to AAV vectors, thereby potentially increasing patient eligibility for treatment compared to other AAV gene therapy product candidates. \u00a0 About CSL Behring CSL Behring is a global biotherapeutics leader driven by its promise to save lives.

The approval, based on data from the PATH (Polyneuropathy And Treatment with Hizentra) Extension study, simplifies dosage adjustments between two safe and effective doses proven to prevent CIDP relapse - without the need for intravenous immune globulin treatment in the event of a relapse on the low dose. The PATH Extension study was a multicenter, open-label extension study to the Phase III PATH study that evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of Hizentra 0.2 g\/kg and 0.4 g\/kg weekly doses in the maintenance treatment of CIDP. \u201cThis label update and data show that physicians can confidently adjust their patient\u2019s subcutaneous immune globulin treatment,\u201d said Arie Katz, Senior Medical Director at CSL Behring. \u201cProviding consistency in a proven treatment can lessen some of the burden that patients living with CIDP may face.\u201d Hizentra is the most prescribed self-infused subcutaneous immune globulin (SCIg) treatment and the first and only SCIg treatment approved for CIDP, allowing CIDP patients the flexibility to self-infuse their immune globulin treatment at home. In 2020, CSL Behring introduced the first and only pre-filled syringes as a simple, convenient and ready-to-use option. \u201cAt CSL Behring, we are dedicated to improving the lives of people with rare and serious diseases and we are fully committed to our promise of innovating treatments that lessen the burden patients and physicians may face in managing CIDP,\u201d said Bernadine Koziara, Vice President, Marketing, CSL Behring. \u201cThis approval will add another great benefit for physicians and patients, providing greater flexibility and a more streamlined treatment approach to deliver the best possible care for CIDP.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 About the PATH Extension Study The 48-week, open-label, prospective extension study to PATH enrolled 82 patients, with 62 patients starting on 0.4 g\/kg weekly infusion of Hizentra and 20 patients starting on 0.2 g\/kg weekly. If clinically stable, patients on 0.4 g\/kg were switched to 0.2 g\/kg after 24 weeks. If relapse occurred while on the 0.2 g\/kg dose, 0.4 g\/kg was either initiated or reinitiated. While most patients remained relapse-free while on either dose of Hizentra, of the 72 patients who received 0.4 g\/kg at any point during the extension study, 90% remained relapse-free. Results demonstrated that the 0.4 g\/kg dose had a higher likelihood of preventing relapse than the 0.2 g\/kg dose. The PATH study was a Phase III clinical trial designed to demonstrate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two different doses of Hizentra, compared with placebo, in the maintenance treatment of CIDP patients previously treated with intravenous immune globulin. The PATH study was the largest ever CIDP trial. About CIDP CIDP is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nerves (those outside the brain and spinal cord) and damages the protective covering of the nerves known as the myelin sheath. This may result in numbness or tingling, muscle weakness, fatigue and other symptoms. CIDP effects can worsen over time, leading to significant activity limitations and a decreased quality of life. CIDP can occur at any age and is more common in men than in women. The GBS|CIDP Foundation estimates that approximately 30 percent of CIDP patients progress to wheelchair dependence if not treated. The Foundation also estimates that the incidence of CIDP in the U.S. is as high as two in 100,000 people each year, with the accumulation of cases over time resulting in prevalence as high as nine in 100,000 in some areas.

No serious safety signals were raised in the trial.\u00a0 The study aimed to determine whether an investigational anti-coronavirus hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (H-Ig) medicine (referred to by the Alliance as CoVIg-19) could reduce the risk of disease progression when added to standard of care treatment including remdesivir in hospitalized adult patients at risk for serious complications. Analyses remain ongoing and NIAID and the INSIGHT Network intend to publish the full results of the trial soon.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhile the results of this particular clinical trial are disappointing, we are proud that as an industry we proactively and collaboratively pursued this work, and that the program may contribute to a growing understanding of this challenging virus and strategies for patient care. Since we embarked on this development program, and throughout the pandemic, we have learned much from our scientific research. Importantly, we learned that as an industry we have the fortitude and capability to quickly work together for the greater good of human health,\u201d said Bill Mezzanotte, MD, MPH, Executive Vice President, Head of Research and Development and Chief Medical Officer, CSL Behring and co-leader of the CoVIg-19 Alliance.\u00a0 \u201cWe are especially proud that we pooled resources, brought our plasma expertise and infrastructure together at our own cost to benefit public health and added to our understanding of a complex field. We are extremely thankful to all those who collaborated day and night for one year in testing circumstances to develop and manufacture a potential solution for COVID-19, including those organizations from outside the industry who chose to support us,\u201d said Julie Kim, President of Plasma-Derived Therapies Business Unit, Takeda and co-leader of the CoVIg-19 Alliance. \u201cWe express our sincere gratitude to the COVID-19 survivors who generously donated their plasma to make our work possible, the patients who graciously participated in the trial, and to the regulatory and government agencies for their partnership and flexibility to support our efforts.\u201d\u00a0 Following the outcome of the ITAC trial, the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance\u2019s work now concludes. The one-year collaboration involving organizations from across the world has strengthened relationships within and outside the industry, enabled a renewed perspective toward pragmatic regulation based on scientific evidence and need, and provided a well-defined, legally compliant framework for future collaborative opportunities to address urgent public health needs. About the ITAC Trial The Phase 3 Inpatient Treatment with Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin (ITAC) clinical trial is a global, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial sponsored and funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It was designed to test the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a combination treatment regimen for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) consisting of the antiviral remdesivir along with an anti-coronavirus hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (H-Ig), which contains a highly concentrated solution of antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2. The antibodies in the H-Ig come from the liquid portion of blood, or plasma, donated by healthy people who have recovered from COVID-19.  Through the NIAID-funded INSIGHT Network, the study team enrolled nearly 600 adult patients at 63 sites in the United States and 10 other countries on five continents. Volunteers were eligible for the trial if they had been hospitalized for COVID-19 and had symptoms for 12 days or fewer without life-threatening organ dysfunction or end-organ failure. Four companies provided investigational H-Ig materials for the trial, including CSL Behring and Takeda on behalf of the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance, as well as Emergent BioSolutions and Grifols. Further information about the ITAC trial is available at ClinicalTrials.gov under study identifier NCT04546581.\u00a0 \u00a0 About the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance In an effort to help fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance was formed in April 2020 to help develop a potential plasma-derived therapy for people at risk for serious complications from COVID-19. The Alliance brought together world-leading plasma companies to work on the development of an investigational unbranded polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin medicine intended for the treatment of treat patients at risk for serious complications from COVID-19. The hyperimmune globulin, known as CoVIg-19, is a high-quality pharmaceutical product that contains purified, consistent, and concentrated levels of convalescent antibodies.  Co-founded by CSL Behring and Takeda, the Alliance also included BioPharma Plasma, Biotest, GC Pharma, LFB, National Bioproducts Institute, Octapharma and Sanquin. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provided advisory support. Microsoft provided technology including the Alliance website and the Plasma Bot for donor recruitment. Organizations including Pall and Uber Health also made in-kind contributions to the Alliance.\u00a0  The Alliance is also part of \u201cThe Fight Is In Us\u201d campaign, a coalition seeking to mobilize tens of thousands of people in the United States who have recovered from COVID-19 to donate their blood plasma. Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19, or know someone who has, can visit TheFightIsInUs.org to understand if they may be eligible to donate and find a nearby blood or plasma donor center using a simple self-screening tool. ###  Media Contacts:  CSL Behring Natalie deVane Natalie.deVane@CSLBehring.com +1-610-999-8756   Greg Healy Greg.Healy@CSLBehring.com +1-610-906-4564  In Australia Christina Hickie Christina.Hickie@csl.com.au\u00a0 Mobile: +61 429 609 762   In Europe Faraz Kermani Faraz.Kermani@CSLBehring.com\u00a0\u00a0 Mobile: +49 (171) 9439569     Takeda In the US Holly Campbell Holly.campbell@takeda.com\u00a0 +1 480-213-8368   Globally Deborah Hibbett Deborah.hibbett@takeda.com\u00a0 +41 79 961 84 64  In Japan Kazumi Kobayashi kazumi.kobayashi@takeda.com\u00a0\u00a0 +81 (0) 3-3278-2095","20":"NEW YORK \u2013 (January 25, 2021) \u2013 Global biotherapeutics leader CSL Behring, and patient empowerment platform, Lyfebulb, announced today the launch of a first-of-its-kind online community support platform, TransplantLyfe, which is dedicated to providing transplant patients, their support partners and donors with the support they need in the transplant journey. Given the relatively low number of individuals undergoing an organ transplant each year, finding others with similar experiences in a local community can be difficult. By providing an active online community, solely focused on transplantation, TransplantLyfe enables connections with others who can relate and provide insights and advice. While transplant patients are closely connected to their healthcare team post-surgery to ensure a safe physical recovery, they may feel emotionally disconnected and experience sensations of guilt and loneliness as they begin to process the mental impact of receiving a transplant.1  Following an organ transplant, patients may have concerns for their future, including fear of organ failure; high anxiety; difficulty managing the burdens of their treatment regimen; social emotional impact; and limitations of their physical activity.2  TransplantLyfe allows users to share their questions and experiences, and to find companionship and support without being limited to their local community. The ability to identify with others\u2019 stories, remain anonymous or connect one-on-one with peers may help improve a patient\u2019s sense of security and inspire them to thrive with their transplant \u2013 not just survive. \u201cCSL Behring is proud to partner in the development and launch of TransplantLyfe \u2013 a critical tool that can directly help provide support to patients and their care team,\u201d said Kevin Kovaleski, Vice President, Global Commercial Development, Transplant, CSL Behring. \u201cThe opportunity to be a part of changing the way that transplantation is managed and cared for is one that closely aligns with delivering on our promise to address unmet needs in the transplant community.\u201d TransplantLyfe was developed as part of an open and honest dialogue with the transplant community to identify and help fulfill the needs of transplant patients, their care partners and donors throughout their journey.  \u201cAs a transplant recipient myself, the creation of TransplantLyfe is extremely personal and is at the very core of the reason Lyfebulb was founded: patients need patients,\u201d said Karin Hehenberger, MD, PhD, Founder & CEO, Lyfebulb. \u201cThe ability to have partnered with CSL Behring, a company dedicated to making strides to improve the continuum of care in transplantation, was pivotal in developing this platform that will serve the needs of thousands of transplant patients across the country.\u201d In addition to managing the physical side effects of anti-rejection medications, transplant patients often carry an emotional burden from the surgery, which can develop into mood disorders, such as anxiety and depression.3,4 While there may be a feeling of euphoria immediately following transplant surgery, patients can face a complex range of emotions \u2013 including anguish, fear, distress and happiness \u2013 as they navigate life post-transplant.4 TransplantLyfe users will be able to make connections to share stories with others, participate in Q&A forums, access information through vetted resources and create journals to track biometrics and other health measurements over time.\u00a0  For more information on TransplantLyfe or to register, please visit https:\/\/www.transplantlyfe.com\/.

HAE is a rare, genetic and potentially life-threatening condition that causes painful, potentially debilitating and unpredictable episodes of swelling of the abdomen, larynx, face and extremities, among other areas of the body.2 HAE is caused by deficient or dysfunctional C1-INH, a protein in the blood that helps to control swelling.2\u00a0 \u201cThis data shows that those living with HAE and their physicians place importance on preventing more attacks, with most people living with HAE preferring a prophylactic treatment that is effective in reducing the number of attacks rather than a treatment that offers less frequent administration,\u201d said Jonathan A. Bernstein, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Immunology and Allergy Section, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. \u201cA treatment that may offer less frequent administration may seem appealing, but these findings suggest that many people living with HAE live with daily fear, stress and anxiety related to having an attack. These substantial burdens should be important points of consideration when discussing and developing treatment plans.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 According to the survey findings, physicians do recognize the negative impact of HAE on virtually every aspect of their patients\u2019 lives, but the survey results also show that people living with HAE view the disease as having a more significant impact on their daily activities. For example, 43% of people living with HAE say the disease has a major negative impact on their work or studies, but only 9% of physicians say the same about their patients.1 \u201cHAE affects my life daily; with the concerns and stress of not only maintaining my own health as a patient, but also that of my children, both of whom also have HAE,\u201d said Cheryl French, a person living with HAE. The survey findings demonstrate physicians and people living with HAE are generally aligned when it comes to making treatment decisions, but results also show that physicians and people living with HAE could benefit from improved dialogue on the factors that are most important in selecting a therapy.1 Other key findings include the following: Treatment   More than 95% of people living with HAE say they are determined to do whatever it takes to avoid HAE attacks and most physicians (82%) agree1 People living with HAE (97%) and physicians (99%) almost universally agree that the best way to manage HAE is to take measures to prevent attacks1 \u00a0  Impact of HAE on Lifestyle   76% of people living with HAE say they worry about having another attack on a daily basis1 Over 8 in 10 people living with HAE consider managing and recovering from an HAE attack to be disruptive to their overall quality of life1 70% of people living with HAE rate their HAE attacks as severe\/very severe1 68% of people living with HAE say having HAE has a major or moderate negative impact on their work\/studies1       About Hereditary Angioedema A\u00a0rare, genetic and potentially life-threatening condition, HAE causes painful, potentially debilitating and unpredictable episodes of swelling of the abdomen, larynx, face and extremities, among other areas of the body.2\u00a0HAE is one of two forms of bradykinin-mediated angioedema, the other being nonhereditary or acquired angioedema.3\u00a0HAE is caused by deficient or dysfunctional C1-INH, a protein in the blood that helps to control swelling.2\u00a0The defect with C1-INH lies within a person's genetic code, which is why HAE runs in families.2\u00a0HAE is classified as either type I, type II or n1-C1-INH (previously known as type III), which is HAE with normal C1-INH levels.2 About the Survey The survey was conducted online by The Harris Poll on behalf of CSL Behring between June 3 and July 7, 2020 among 100 U.S. adults ages 18+ who have been diagnosed by a healthcare professional with HAE (\u201cpeople living with HAE\u201d); and 150 licensed Allergists\/Immunologists in the U.S. who have treated\/managed at least two people living with HAE in the past 12 months (\u201cphysicians\u201d).\u00a0 People living with HAE were identified and recruited directly by treating physicians. Pre-screened participants were provided a custom, password protected link and were invited to a secure website to be fully screened, and if qualified, to complete an online self-administered questionnaire via a personal device. Results were not weighted and are only representative of those who participated in the research. Physicians were sampled from the online physician panel and invited to a secure website to be fully screened, and if qualified, to complete an online self-administered questionnaire via a personal device. Raw data for physicians were weighted by years in practice, gender and geographic region. About CSL Behring CSL Behring\u00a0is a global biotherapeutics leader driven by its promise to save lives.

Studies have shown that an infusion of CSL112 rapidly enhances cholesterol efflux capacity. Cholesterol efflux is the first and most critical step in reverse cholesterol transport and is the body\u2019s primary mechanism for clearing cells of excess cholesterol that would otherwise continue to accumulate in plaque. This build-up of plaque over time can rupture and potentially cause a cardiovascular event. Compared to the standard of care, CSL112 is a therapy that may offer a unique approach to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients diagnosed with either STEMI or NSTEMI.  About cardiovascular disease  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally, with an estimated 800,000 acute MIs occurring each year in the U.S. alone.1,2 Patients who survive a heart attack are at high risk of experiencing early recurrent CV events. The majority of these 1-year recurrent CV events (approximately 60%) occur in the first 90 days after the index event.3 Although the overall rate of MIs has decreased over the last two to three decades,4 the proportion of the events occurring in the first 90 days remains unchanged.

The primary efficacy outcome is time to the first occurrence of the MACE composite, which includes CV death, heart attack or stroke, from randomization through 90 days.  Patients eligible for enrollment include adults at least 18 years of age who experienced a type 1 (spontaneous) heart attack, along with multivessel coronary artery disease and the presence of established CV risk factors, including treatment for type 2 diabetes or at least two of the following: age \u226565 years, prior history of heart attack or peripheral arterial disease (PAD).  Participants enrolled will be stratified by the type of the initial heart attack (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)), how the initial heart attack was managed (percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or medically managed), and geographic region of the world. Participants will then be randomized using a 1:1 ratio to receive four weekly infusions of either 6g CSL112 or placebo. The study will end at least 365 days after the last participant is randomized. AEGIS-II is being conducted under the academic leadership of the PERFUSE Group at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the Duke Clinical Research Institute and the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute.  About the AEGIS Clinical Study Program  Prior to AEGIS-II, results from the Phase 2b AEGIS-I study were published in Circulation. A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study, AEGIS-I met its primary safety endpoints, showing CSL112 did not cause significant changes in liver or kidney function and was well-tolerated when administered to patients who experienced a heart attack. The study also confirmed CSL112's mechanism of action, cholesterol efflux enhancement, as demonstrated by an immediate, up to four-fold increase compared to baseline in cholesterol efflux capacity.6 \u00a0An additional Phase 2 trial, published in American Heart Journal, demonstrated renal safety of CSL112 in patients with moderate renal impairment who experienced a heart attack.  About CSL112 CSL112, Apolipoprotein A-I (Human), is a novel formulation of human plasma-derived apoA-I, the primary functional component of high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Studies have shown that an infusion of CSL112 rapidly enhances cholesterol efflux capacity. Cholesterol efflux is the first and most critical step in reverse cholesterol transport and is the body\u2019s primary mechanism for clearing cells of excess cholesterol that would otherwise continue to accumulate in plaque. This build-up of plaque over time can rupture and potentially cause a cardiovascular event. Compared to the standard of care, CSL112 is a therapy that may offer a unique approach to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients diagnosed with either STEMI or NSTEMI.

These designations grant special status to drugs and biological products intended to treat a rare disease, affecting less than 200,000 patients in the US or affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the European Union.  CSL889 is a form of plasma-derived hemopexin, an important, naturally occurring protein produced in the body whose levels are decreased in patients with SCD. Low levels of hemopexin have been associated with increased symptoms in SCD, particularly acute vaso-occlusive crises (VOC). VOC, the most common manifestation in SCD, are severe, debilitating episodes characterized by severe pain. There is no approved treatment for acute VOC, so episodes can only be managed with supportive measures such as fluids and pain killers. \u201cHaving treated hundreds of adults and children living with sickle cell disease over 30 years, I\u2019m intensely aware of the need for novel and effective therapies, especially to relieve the tremendous pain from VOC,\u201d said Professor Greg Kato, who is leading the clinical development of CSL 889 at CSL Behring. \u201cThis newly granted orphan status recognizes the urgency for progressing new treatment options into the clinic.\u201d  CSL Behring has two Phase I SCD programs poised to evolve the treatment paradigm for patients: CSL889 hemopexin therapy for the treatment of VOC and CSL200 lentiviral stem cell gene therapy for long-term disease management.\u00a0  About Sickle Cell Disease Sickle Cell Disease is a hereditary blood disorder in which red blood cells contain an abnormal type of hemoglobin, causing some of the cells to become distorted into a crescent, or sickle-shape.\u00a0 These misshapen red blood cells have difficulty passing through small blood vessels, slowing and blocking blood flow to areas of the body, damaging tissue that isn\u2019t receiving a normal flow of blood.\u00a0\u00a0 Sickle Cell Disease can lead to episodes of severe pain, strokes, kidney, lung and heart problems, slow growth, vision problems and infection vulnerability. \u00a0While frequency of Sickle Cell Disease varies globally, it is estimated to impact 100,000 people in the US and 1 in 10,000 persons in the European Union.

If the vaccine development is successful, CSL anticipates producing the vaccine for Australia and distribution to global markets via the COVAX facility toward the end of 2021. And CSL is also working with AstraZeneca to manufacture, if successful, approximately 30 million doses of its vaccine candidate under development with the University of Oxford (AZ1222) for supply to Australia. Co-founding the\u00a0CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance, an unprecedented industry partnership of more than 12 plasma industry companies, to develop a hyperimmune for treating COVID-19. The phase 3 study in which the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance is participating. enrolled its first clinical trial participant in early-October. The study will take several months to complete, but if successful, will be the basis for regulatory submissions. Developing an investigational, anti-SARS-CoV-2 plasma hyperimmune product for the Australian market to treat people with serious complications of COVID-19. The company is currently manufacturing its therapy for the clinical trial. Conducting a\u00a0Phase 2 study to assess the safety and efficacy of garadacimab (Factor XIIa antagonist monoclonal antibody) to treat patients suffering from severe respiratory distress, a leading cause of death in patients with COVID-19 related pneumonia. The first patient was enrolled in July.

The trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of an investigational anti-coronavirus hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (H-Ig) medicine for treating hospitalized adults at risk for serious complications of COVID-19 disease. If successful, the Alliance\u2019s H-Ig may become one of the earliest treatment options for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This global multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial will enroll 500 adult patients at up to 58 sites in the United States, Mexico and 16 other countries on five continents \u00a0(utilizing the NIH\u2019s global INSIGHT Network), who have been hospitalized for COVID-19 and have had symptoms for 12 days or fewer without life-threatening organ dysfunction or end-organ failure. Patients will receive remdesivir as standard of care, allowing the safety and efficacy of H-Ig to be evaluated when given along with remdesivir treatment. The investigational H-Ig materials for the trial will be provided by CSL Behring and Takeda on behalf of the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance, as well as by two other companies. \u201cThe rapid progress we\u2019ve made since we initiated this program just a few months ago to reach this key milestone of enrolling patients in the trial is a powerful testament to the collaboration, determination and innovation taking place across the biomedical community as we work to fight the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said Julie Kim, President of Plasma-Derived Therapies Business Unit, Takeda and co-leader of the CoVIg-19 Alliance. \u201cThis study will help us understand how CoVIg-19 could potentially become an important therapeutic option. To support our efforts, we encourage all those people who have recovered from COVID-19 to donate their plasma, which contains vital antibodies that have fought off the disease and could help others do the same.\u201d \u201cWhen we created the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance in April, the goal was to partner to accelerate our timelines so that we could develop and deliver a reliable and sustainable treatment option for people suffering the impact of COVID-19 and to support countries around the world in their efforts to fight the current pandemic,\u201d said Bill Mezzanotte, MD, MPH, Executive Vice President, Head of Research and Development and Chief Medical Officer, CSL Behring and co-leader of the CoVIg-19 Alliance. \u201cThanks to the unprecedented collaboration from the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance members, commitment from those who have recovered from the virus and generously chosen to donate their plasma, as well as the strong support from the NIH, we are hopeful that data from the clinical trial will be available before the end of the year.

A rare, genetic and potentially life-threatening condition, HAE affects about 1 in 50,000 people in the United States1, causing painful, potentially debilitating and unpredictable episodes of swelling of the abdomen, larynx, face and extremities, among other areas of the body.2 Children have a 50% chance of inheriting HAE if one of their parents has the disease.2 HAEGARDA, the HAE therapy that reduces attacks by a median of 95%, is now the first and only subcutaneous treatment option for prevention of hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks in patients 6 years of age and older.\u00a0 In addition to the expanded pediatric indication, the updated label now includes clinical safety data regarding HAEGARDA use in pregnant women. \"Since 2017, HAEGARDA has been a trusted and effective option for patients seeking to prevent HAE attacks, but until now preventative options for younger children living with the condition have been limited,\u201d said Debra Bensen-Kennedy, MD, Vice President, North America Medical Affairs, CSL Behring. \u201cWith this expanded indication, we are able to offer pediatric patients as young as 6 years of age, an effective, preventative subcutaneous solution and deliver on our promise of addressing the unmet needs of people living with HAE.\u201d The latest FDA approval was based on results from two CSL Behring-sponsored COMPACT (Clinical Study for\u00a0Optimal\u00a0Management of\u00a0Preventing\u00a0Angioedema with Low-Volume Subcutaneous\u00a0C1-Inhibitor Replacement\u00a0Therapy) trials: COMPACT Pivotal Study and COMPACT Open Label Extension (OLE) Study. COMPACT, an international, prospective multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 pivotal study, included six subjects aged 17 years or younger with symptomatic HAE. In the COMPACT pivotal study, HAEGARDA, at the FDA approved dose of 60 IU\/kg, reduced the number of HAE attacks by a median of 95% relative to placebo. Use of rescue medication was reduced by a median of greater than 99% versus placebo.3 COMPACT OLE featured 126 subjects, including nine patients ages 17 years or younger. In this trial, all nine pediatric subjects experienced greater than 50 percent reduction in number of attacks per month versus the pre-study period, with a median of 97% reduction in the median number of attacks\/month (0.11).4 All subjects had less than one attack\/4-week period and four had less than one attack\/year (one subject was attack free).4,5 No subject discontinued treatment due to a treatment-related adverse event. Safety and effectiveness results of subgroup analysis by age was consistent with overall study results. \u201cThe FDA\u2019s approval of HAEGARDA for preventing HAE attacks in children six years of age and older represents a major stride in filling an unmet medical need.\u00a0 The U.S. Hereditary Angioedema Association is excited that there is now a subcutaneous prophylaxis option for the younger members of our HAE community and the families that care for them,\u201d said Anthony J. Castaldo, U.S. HAEA President & Chief Executive Officer. The new label now includes results from the randomized, open-label, active treatment controlled study regarding four patients who became pregnant during the study, and received treatment until pregnancy was identified. These patients ranged in age from 19 to 32 and received C1-INH (S.C. administration). Patients received HAEGARDA for 4 \u2013 8 weeks (9 - 15 doses) during the first trimester.\u00a0 As noted, these women reported no complications during delivery and all women delivered healthy babies.5, 6 \u201cAs the mother of a young patient and an active member of the HAE community, this news brings tears to my eyes as I am reminded of our struggles and strides over the years,\u201d says Lisa Chacon, HAE patient advocate. \u201cIt warms my heart to know that so many children will now have access to this convenient, preventative therapy.\u201d CSL Behring is driven by its promise to save and improve the lives of HAE patients and their families and is committed to helping patients get access to its innovative therapies, regardless of their financial situation. For more information about HAEGARDA, including the U.S. Prescribing Information, visit www.HAEGARDA.com. \u00a0 About HAEGARDA\u00ae (C1 Esterase Inhibitor Subcutaneous [Human]) HAEGARDA is a self-administered, plasma-derived concentrate of C1-esterase inhibitor and the only subcutaneous therapy approved in the United States for routine prophylaxis to prevent HAE attack in patients 6 years of age and older. HAEGARDA targets the root cause of HAE by replacing deficient or dysfunctional C1-INH, restoring functional C1-INH levels to above 40 percent of normal levels, which is proposed to reduce the risk of HAE attacks. HAEGARDA is dosed individually based on body weight so that each patient can achieve functional C1-INH levels. About Hereditary Angioedema A rare, genetic and potentially life-threatening condition, HAE causes painful, debilitating and unpredictable episodes of swelling of the abdomen, larynx, face and extremities, among other areas of the body. HAE is one of two forms of bradykinin-mediated angioedema, the other being nonhereditary or acquired angioedema. HAE is caused by deficient or dysfunctional C1-INH, a key protein in the body that controls swelling. The defect with C1-INH lies within a person's genetic code, which is why HAE runs in families. HAE is classified as either type I, type II or HAE with normal C1-INH levels. \u00a0 About CSL Behring CSL Behring is a global biotherapeutics leader driven by its promise to save lives.

INDICATIONS AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION ABOUT HAEGARDA  INDICATIONS HAEGARDA\u00ae, C1 Esterase Inhibitor Subcutaneous (Human), is a plasma-derived concentrate of C1 Esterase Inhibitor (C1-INH) indicated for routine prophylaxis to prevent Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) attacks in patients 6 years of age and older. HAEGARDA is for subcutaneous use after reconstitution only. \u00a0 IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION HAEGARDA is contraindicated in patients with a history of life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to C1-INH preparations or their excipients. \u00a0 Severe hypersensitivity reactions to HAEGARDA could occur. In such cases, discontinue administration and institute appropriate treatment. Epinephrine should be immediately available to treat hypersensitivity reactions. \u00a0 At the recommended subcutaneous dose of HAEGARDA, no causal relationship to thromboembolic events (TEs) has been established. However, TEs have been reported with intravenous administration of C1-INH products, usually at high doses. \u00a0 In clinical trials, adverse reactions observed in more than 4% of subjects treated with HAEGARDA were injection-site reactions, hypersensitivity, nasopharyngitis, and dizziness.  \u00a0 HAEGARDA is derived from human plasma. The risk of transmission of infectious agents, including viruses and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent and its variant (vCJD), cannot be completely eliminated.

Representing the plasma industry, Perreault pointed to the unprecedented CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance industry collaboration which was co-founded by CSL Behring and Takeda this year to accelerate the development of a plasma-derived hyperimmune globulin therapy for COVID-19. The clinical trial, sponsored by The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), in which the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance will participate is expected to begin soon.\u00a0 \u201cThe plasma industry has created an unprecedented partnership of world-leading companies at the outset of the pandemic in the CoVIg-19 Alliance and Coalition of Coalitions to help develop a reliable, scalable and sustainable plasma therapy to treat COVID-19,\u201d said Perreault. \u201cThe amount of therapy we can produce is directly tied to the number of people who donate plasma \u2014 even those who aren\u2019t sure, or don\u2019t even know, that they have had the virus. So today is a call to action for everyone to donate plasma and help us in the fight against COVID-19.\u201d Perreault said the plasma industry has dedicated its leadership, expertise and resources to the fight against COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. Today, the industry asked the White House for help with further accelerating the development of a hyperimmune \u2013 particularly encouraging recovered COVID-19 patients to donate plasma. \u201cWe are all in this together,\u201d Perreault said. \u201cAs an industry, we would also like to thank the President and the Administration for their support in encouraging plasma donations and for the partnership that is critical to enabling the potential hyperimmune to treat people experiencing serious complications from COVID-19.\u201d How you can help: Donate plasma A coalition of world-leading medical and research institutions, blood centers, life science companies, technology companies, philanthropic organizations, and COVID-19 survivor groups has come together to support the rapid development of potential new therapies for patients with COVID-19. Working together under the \"The Fight is in Us\"\u00a0campaign, the coalition is seeking to mobilize tens of thousands of people in the United States who have recovered from COVID-19 to donate their blood plasma. Donating blood plasma is a generally safe and proven process.  Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19, or know someone who has, can visit TheFightIsInUs.org\u00a0to understand if they may be eligible to donate and find a nearby blood or plasma donor center using a simple self-screening tool. The coalition offers more than 1,500 locations at which COVID-19 survivors can choose to donate.  About the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance  In an effort to help fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, a new alliance was created in April 2020 to help develop a potential plasma-derived therapy for people at risk for serious complications from COVID-19. The CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance brings together world-leading plasma companies to work on the development of an investigational unbranded polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin medicine with the potential to treat patients who are at risk for serious complications from COVID-19. The \u201cI\u201d and \u201cg\u201d in CoVIg-19 stand for immune globulin, which the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance will use to concentrate the antibodies into a potential medicine.

In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, approximately 124 adult patients testing positive for the SARS CoV-2 infection will be randomized to receive either CSL312 or placebo, in addition to standard of care (SOC) treatment. The primary endpoint being the incidence of tracheal intubation or death. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe greatest clinical challenge in treating patients with severe COVID-19 and improving outcomes has been our ability to manage the serious respiratory complications associated with the disease,\u201d said Lars Groenke, R&D Lead, Respiratory Therapeutic Area, CSL Behring. \u201cOur hope with CSL312 is to be able to prevent the progression of COVID-19, improve patient outcomes, and provide physicians with an effective tool in the fight against this deadly virus.\u201d Currently, CSL Behring is evaluating five approaches across its plasma fractionation and recombinant and antibody strategic scientific platforms to preventing and treating COVID-19.\u00a0  In addition to the study of CSL312, CSL Behring:  Has entered into a partnering agreement with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and The University of Queensland (UQ) to accelerate the development, manufacture and distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate that has been pioneered by researchers at UQ.

About CSL312 (Garadacimab) Garadacimab is a novel Factor XIIa-inhibitory monoclonal antibody (FXIIa mAb) that CSL Behring is currently investigating for indications where FXIIa inhibition may be a factor in improving clinical outcomes. These include a recently initiated study to assess garadacimab for prevention of respiratory failure in adult patients with the COVID-19 virus.\u00a0 Garadacimab is also currently in clinical development as a new type of once-monthly subcutaneous prophylactic treatment for attacks related to hereditary angioedema (HAE), a form of bradykinin-mediated angioedema. Results from this Phase 2 study showed that garadacimab was well tolerated and met the primary endpoint of reduction in attacks in HAE patients. Garadacimab inhibits the plasma protein, FXIIa. When FXIIa is activated, it initiates the cascade of events leading to edema formation. By targeting FXIIa, garadacimab can prevent the initiation of this cascade. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted orphan-drug designation to garadacimab as an investigational therapy for the prevention of bradykinin-mediated angioedema.

The AMT-061 program, currently in Phase 3 clinical trials, could be one of the first gene therapies to provide potentially long-term benefits to patients with hemophilia B.  One dose of AMT-061 has shown to increase Factor IX (FIX) plasma levels \u2013 the blood clotting protein lacking in people with hemophilia B \u2013 to a degree that reduces or eliminates the tendency for bleeding for many years. Should AMT-061 be successful, appropriate candidate hemophilia B patients would be able to have a one-time treatment to restore FIX activity to functional levels capable of eliminating the need for frequent and ongoing replacement therapies. \u201cOur vision with hemophilia B patients is to offer transformational treatment paradigms that help free them from the lifelong burden of this disease,\u201d said CSL\u2019s CEO and Managing Director Paul Perreault. \u201cWith more than three decades of providing lifesaving innovations for the global bleeding disorders community, we are well positioned to maximize the potential benefit of this therapy.\u201d Under the agreement with uniQure, upon closing the transaction CSL Behring will have the exclusive global right to commercialize AMT-061. uniQure will receive an upfront cash payment of US$450 million followed by regulatory and commercial sales milestone payments and royalties. Under the terms of the agreement, uniQure will complete the Phase 3 trial and scale up manufacture for early commercial supply under an agreed plan with CSL Behring.\u00a0 The transaction is subject to customary regulatory clearances before closing. \u201cWe are thrilled to enter into this commercialization and license agreement with CSL Behring, an ideal commercial partner with global reach and decades of expertise in hemophilia,\u201d stated Matt Kapusta, chief executive officer of uniQure. \u201cWe believe that through this arrangement, we are ideally positioned to deliver our innovative gene therapy to the largest number of hemophilia B patients as quickly as possible. The transaction represents a major milestone in the development of etranacogene dezaparvovec and, when closed, we expect that it will provide uniQure with significant financial resources to advance and expand our pipeline of gene therapy candidates, anchored by AMT-130 in Huntington\u2019s disease, as well as to invest further in our leading manufacturing and technology platform.\u201d  In December 2019, uniQure announced that data from its Phase 2b dose-confirmation study of AMT-061 showed that all patients stabilized and sustained FIX activity at functionally high levels one year after a single dose \u2013 with increases in FIX activity of up to 50% of normal and a mean of 41%. This exceeds the levels considered sufficient to eliminate or significantly reduce the risk of bleeding events.  According to CSL Behring\u2019s Executive Vice President, Head of Research and Development and Chief Medical Officer Bill Mezzanotte, \u201cWe are exceedingly encouraged by the data we\u2019ve seen on AMT-061. Not only has the treatment option demonstrated robust clinically meaningful responses in FIX activity, but it has also exhibited excellent safety over multiple years of observation. Expanding our gene therapy portfolio to treat hemophilia B, a disease state well known to CSL Behring, exemplifies how we are strategically aligning our rare and serious disease focus and our targeted therapeutic area focus with our core scientific platforms to transform the lives of patients.\u201d  This acquisition will also enhance CSL Behring\u2019s capabilities in its growing gene therapy portfolio. The company is currently developing a stem cell gene therapy (CSL200) for the treatment of sickle cell disease and has recently established an alliance with Seattle Children\u2019s Research Institute to develop a stem cell gene therapy for primary immunodeficiency diseases -- another rare disease area where CSL Behring has leading capabilities. Perreault added, \u201cUpon approval, this next-generation therapy will be highly complementary to our existing best-in-class hemophilia B product portfolio with an alternate best-in-class treatment option. With the license to AMT-061, we are building on our legacy of delivering lifesaving innovations in hematology where, today, we offer a market leading product for hemophilia B and we are a leader in therapies for treating hemophilia A, von Willebrand disease, thrombosis, and other life-threatening conditions.\u201d CSL Behring has put patients first by addressing the world\u2019s most serious, complicated and rare diseases for over 100 years. The company is now bringing that same commitment to gene therapy; its mission is to address unmet patient needs and enable patients to get the very most out of life.  About Etranacogene Dezaparvovec (AMT-061) Etranacogene dezaparvovec, also known as AMT-061, consists of an AAV5 viral vector carrying a gene cassette with the patent-protected Padua variant of Factor IX (FIX-Padua). AAV5-based gene therapies have been demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated in many clinical trials, including four uniQure trials conducted in 25 patients in hemophilia B and other indications. No patient treated in clinical trials with uniQure\u2019s AAV5-based gene therapies has experienced any cytotoxic T-cell-mediated immune response to the capsid. Additionally, preclinical and clinical data show that AAV5-based gene therapies may be clinically effective in patients with pre-existing antibodies to AAV5, thereby potentially increasing patient eligibility for treatment compared to other gene therapy product candidates.

The companies entered into a strategic partnership in 2017 to expedite the development of clazakizumab with the option for CSL Behring to acquire Vitaeris, along with this important product candidate. With this acquisition, clazakizumab joins CSL842 and CSL964 as part of CSL Behring\u2019s portfolio of products in late-stage development to address significant unmet needs in the transplant community.  \u201cClazakizumab has been a promising monoclonal antibody in the Transplant therapeutic area since we started working with Vitaeris several years ago,\u201d said Bill Mezzanotte, M.D., Executive Vice President, Head of R&D, CSL Behring.\u00a0 \u201cAcquiring Vitaeris and their associate expertise helps us to continue to grow our strategic scientific platform of recombinant proteins and antibodies. We look forward to continuing to advance this treatment candidate as a potential option for people experiencing rejection \u2013 an area where current treatment options for transplant recipients are limited, at best.\u201d  Vitaeris President and CEO Kevin Chow, Ph.D. said, \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to become part of CSL Behring, a well-established, global industry leader, and know that the future of clazakizumab is in excellent hands.\u00a0 Together, we have already achieved much progress through our partnership over the past few years and are now in an even stronger position to realize our collective goal of addressing one of the greatest unmet needs in the organ transplant community.\"  Clazakizumab is a potent, monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits IL-6, an important driver of the inflammatory response that is known to play a key role in transplant rejection. While advances in transplantation techniques and therapies have markedly improved short-term success rates over the past 15 \u2013 20 years, long-term graft survival remains one of the greatest challenges, with AMR recognized as the most common cause of long-term kidney allograft failure. There are currently no approved treatments for transplant recipients who develop antibody-mediated rejection. Continued progress and ultimately effective solutions for transplant recipients in this area is of high importance to CSL Behring as well as the global transplant community. For over 100 years, CSL Behring has put patients first by addressing the world\u2019s most serious, complicated and rare disorders. The company is now bringing that same commitment to transplantation; Its mission is to address unmet patient needs before, during, and after transplantation, to enable patients to get the very most out of the gift of life.

The data, presented at the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Digital Congress 2020, showed that the study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating reduced number of attacks compared to placebo in patients with HAE. Mean percentage reductions were 88.68%, 98.94%, and 90.50% in three garadacimab groups - 75, 200, and 600 mg subcutaneous (SC) - versus placebo. The study also showed garadacimab to be well-tolerated. HAE is a rare, genetic and potentially life-threatening condition that causes painful, debilitating and unpredictable episodes of swelling of the abdomen, larynx, face and extremities, among other areas of the body. Garadacimab inhibits the plasma protein, FXIIa. FXIIa initiates the cascade of events that lead to edema formation. By targeting FXIIa, garadacimab can prevent the initiation of this cascade.  Additionally, last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted orphan drug designation to garadacimab as an investigational therapy for the prevention of bradykinin-mediated angioedema, which includes both hereditary and non-hereditary (acquired) angioedema. The FDA Office of Orphan Products Development (OOPD) grants orphan drug designation to novel drugs or biologics that treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 U.S. patients. The designation qualifies companies with a range of incentives, including the potential for marketing exclusivity upon approval. \u201cThe attacks that HAE patients experience can be very frightening, and clinicians want to do anything in their power to reduce the frequency of these attacks, lessen the need for rescue medicine and simplify treatment,\u201d said lead study investigator Timothy Craig, D.O., Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, Department of Medicine and Pediatrics, Penn State Hershey, Hershey, PA. \u201cThe findings of this study are very encouraging and we look forward to further research assessing the safety and efficacy of garadacimab.\u201d Affecting about one in 40,000-50,000 people globally, attacks of HAE can happen suddenly and with little warning. Many people with HAE need both preventive treatment as well as on-demand (or \u201crescue\u201d) therapies to treat an attack in progress, both of which are associated with frequent dosing. \u201cConsistent with our more than 40-year commitment to HAE therapeutic innovation, garadacimab represents a potentially first-in-class agent that utilizes a unique approach as a preventive treatment in HAE,\u201d said Mittie Doyle, M.D., Vice President, Research and Development, Immunology Therapeutic Area at CSL Behring. \u201cWe are encouraged by the promising garadacimab data as well as the orphan drug designation milestone and look forward to advancing the clinical program to continue to deliver on our promise and improve the lives of people living with HAE.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 About the Phase 2 Study In the Phase 2 study, a total of 32 adults with HAE were randomized and received either garadacimab (either 75 mg, 200 mg or 600 mg) or placebo every four weeks for 12 weeks. Researchers observed the following:  Significantly fewer monthly attacks in all three groups taking garadacimab, with garadacimab reducing the mean attack rates by 88.68%, 98.94% and 90.50%, respectively, compared to placebo. Specifically, the monthly attack rates were 0.48, 0.05 and 0.40 for the three doses of garadacimab compared to 4.24 for placebo. As comparison, patients experienced a mean monthly attack rate of 5.17 prior to the start of the study.A large portion of patients taking garadacimab were attack-free during the course of the study. Specifically, 55.56%, 87.5% and 42.86% of patients taking garadacimab, respectively, did not have any attacks compared to zero percent in the placebo group.   All adverse events were mild or moderate, with the percentage of patients experiencing at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) being similar across all groups. The common TEAE was mild to moderate injection site erythema (12.5%).    \u00a0 Additional Study Details This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm Phase 2 study (NCT03712228) examined the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of three different doses of garadacimab, an novel investigational FXIIa mAb, compared to placebo for the preventive treatment of HAE. Enrolled patients were 18-65 years of age with type I or type II HAE, with four or more documented attacks over a consecutive two-month period during the three months prior to screening. Patients were randomized to receive either garadacimab 75 mg (n=9), garadacimab 200 mg (n=8), garadacimab 600 mg (n=7) or placebo (n=8), which were given as a subcutaneous injection every four weeks for 12 weeks after an intravenous loading dose. The primary endpoint was the number of attacks. Secondary endpoints included the reduction in attacks compared with the run-in period (4 or up to 8 weeks prior to the start of treatment) or placebo, use of on-demand therapies (to treat an attack) per month and safety.  \u00a0 About Hereditary Angioedema A rare, genetic and potentially life-threatening condition, HAE causes painful, debilitating and unpredictable episodes of swelling of the abdomen, larynx, face and extremities, among other areas of the body. HAE is one of two forms of bradykinin-mediated angioedema, the other being nonhereditary or acquired angioedema. HAE is caused by deficient or dysfunctional C1-INH, a protein in the blood that helps to control inflammation. The defect with C1-INH lies within a person's genetic code, which is why HAE runs in families. HAE is classified as either type I, type II or C1-n (previously known as type III), which is HAE with normal C1-INH levels. \u00a0 More on Garadacimab Garadacimab is a novel Factor XIIa-inhibitory monoclonal antibody (FXIIa mAb) currently in Phase 2 clinical development as a new type of once-monthly subcutaneous prophylactic treatment for attacks related to HAE, a form of bradykinin-mediated angioedema. Garadacimab inhibits the plasma protein, FXIIa. When FXIIa is activated, it initiates the cascade of events leading to edema formation. By targeting FXIIa, garadacimab can prevent the initiation of this cascade. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted orphan-drug designation to garadacimab as an investigational therapy for the prevention of bradykinin-mediated angioedema. CSL Behring is also investigating garadacimab for other indications, beyond HAE, where FXIIa inhibition may be a factor in improving clinical outcomes. \u00a0 About CSL Behring  CSL Behring is a global biotherapeutics leader driven by its promise to save lives.

Initially, the alliance will focus on the development of treatment options for patients with two rare, life-threatening primary immunodeficiency diseases -- Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome and X-linked Agammaglobulinemia. These are two of more than 400 identified primary immunodeficiency diseases in which a part of the body\u2019s immune system is missing or functions improperly. \"CSL Behring will collaborate with Seattle Children\u2019s experts to apply our novel gene therapy technology to their research pipeline, with an aim to address unmet needs for people living with certain rare primary immunodeficiency diseases,\" said Bill Mezzanotte, MD, Executive Vice President, Head of Research and Development for CSL Behring. \u201cExpanding our gene therapy portfolio into an area of immunology well known to CSL exemplifies how we are strategically growing our capabilities in this strategic scientific platform and are collaborating with world class institutions to access innovation with the potential to vastly improve patients\u2019 lives.\u201d \u201cStem cell gene therapies that correct the genetic abnormality driving a child\u2019s disease will transform the therapeutic options for children with Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome, X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia and other immunodeficiency diseases,\u201d said David J. Rawlings, MD, director of the Center for Immunity and Immunotherapies and division chief of immunology at Seattle Children\u2019s, and a professor of pediatrics and immunology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. \u201cThe collaboration with CSL Behring supports our longstanding research programs for pediatric immunodeficiency diseases and will accelerate this research toward clinical trials, helping get these innovations to the children who need them.\u201d CSL Behring researchers, working with researchers from Seattle Children\u2019s Research Institute, will investigate applying the proprietary platform technologies, Select+\u2122 and Cytegrity\u2122, to several pre-clinical gene therapy programs. These technologies, which have broad applications in ex vivo stem cell gene therapy, are designed to address some of the major challenges associated with the commercialization of stem cell therapy, including the ability to manufacture consistent, high-quality products, and to improve engraftment, efficacy and tolerability. Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) has an estimated incidence between one and 10 cases per million males worldwide, according to the National Institutes of Health. WAS patients\u2019 immune systems function abnormally, making them susceptible to infections. They also experience eczema, autoimmunity and difficulty forming blood clots, leaving them vulnerable to life threatening bleeding complications. Today the only known cure for WAS is a stem cell transplant, if a suitable donor can be found. X-linked Agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is another rare primary immunodeficiency in which patients have low levels of immunoglobulins (also known as antibodies), which are key proteins made by the immune system to help fight infections. Like WAS, XLA affects males almost exclusively, although females can be genetic carriers of the condition. While no cure exists for XLA, the goal of treatment is to boost the immune system by replacing missing antibodies and preventing or aggressively treating infections that occur, according to the Immune Deficiency Foundation.

Working together under the \u201cThe Fight Is In Us\u201d campaign, the coalition is seeking to mobilize tens of thousands of people in the United States who have recovered from COVID-19 to donate their blood plasma, which contains vital antibodies that have fought off the disease and could now help others do the same.  The campaign is working against two urgent timelines: to recruit COVID-19 survivors within two months of their recovery to ensure that their blood plasma contains a robust enough concentration of antibodies to have a positive effect, and to address the substantial seasonal increase in COVID-19 cases anticipated this fall in the Northern Hemisphere by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other public health experts. \u201cAs an early survivor of COVID-19, I was desperate to do whatever was in my power to be a part of the solution. I started Survivor Corps to mobilize and connect the thousands of people affected by COVID-19 to support all ongoing scientific, medical and academic research, and this coalition is furthering our goal,\u201d said Diana Berrent, founder of Survivor Corps. \u201cInside COVID-19 survivors is the antibody-rich blood plasma that may help stem the tide of this pandemic. The time is now for superhero volunteers to donate their blood plasma and help stop COVID-19 in its tracks.\u201d Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19, or know someone who has, can visit TheFightIsInUs.org to understand if they may be eligible to donate and find a nearby blood or plasma donor center using a simple self-screening tool. Donating blood plasma is a generally safe and proven process. The coalition offers more than 1,500 locations at which COVID-19 survivors can choose to donate. Donations can be made at both blood and plasma donor centers. The coalition partners are working on two distinct approaches for treating COVID-19 that both urgently require collection of convalescent plasma now. One approach is the direct transfusion of blood plasma though the Expanded Access Program for convalescent plasma, which is currently being administered with authorization from the Food & Drug Administration by Mayo Clinic. Its safety and efficacy are currently being evaluated through multiple clinical trials in different populations. Blood donor centers throughout the country are currently collecting convalescent plasma from COVID-19 survivors for this purpose. The other approach is the development of a medicine known as a hyperimmune globulin (H-Ig), which is being manufactured now and will be studied in clinical trials this summer. Through the manufacturing process, the plasma is pooled, concentrated and purified, resulting in a vial of medicine with consistent levels of antibodies that is easy to store, distribute and administer to patients. Coalition members developing an H-Ig include the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance (CSL Behring, Takeda, ADMA Biologics, Biopharma Plasma, Biotest, BPL, GC Pharma, LFB,\u00a0Octapharma and Sanquin) and Grifols.  About \"The Fight Is In Us\"  \u201cThe Fight Is In Us\u201d is an initiative to maximize the individual and societal benefit of COVID-19 plasma. The campaign will focus on recruiting COVID-19 survivors to donate their plasma at licensed blood and plasma donor centers. The campaign will begin in the United States, and then expand to Europe.  This is a united effort bringing together several coalitions and organizations, including academic medical institutions (the National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Expanded Access Program led by Mayo Clinic and including Johns Hopkins University, Michigan State University and Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis); plasma companies (Grifols and the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance including those announced at its inception\u2014Biotest, BPL, CSL Behring, LFB, Octapharma, and Takeda\u2014and new members ADMA Biologics, Biopharma Plasma, GC Pharma, and Sanquin); national blood center organizations (including the AABB, America\u2019s Blood Centers and Blood Centers of America;); health benefits company Anthem Inc.; health care diagnostics company LabCorp; grassroots, survivor, and non-profit groups including Stop the Spread, Survivor Corps, and XPRIZE; and marketing and media support from the Ad Council. Ashfield Healthcare is providing contact center service to support COVID-19 survivors. \u201cThe Fight Is In Us\u201d is also supported by advisory and technology members.

Its membership has expanded globally to include 10 plasma companies, and now also includes global organizations from outside the plasma industry who are providing vital support to encourage more people to donate plasma. In addition to those announced at its inception - Biotest, BPL, CSL Behring, LFB, Octapharma and Takeda - the Alliance welcomes new industry members ADMA Biologics, BioPharma Plasma, GC Pharma, and Sanquin. Together, these organizations will contribute specialist advisory expertise, technical guidance and\/or in-kind support to contribute to the Alliance goal of accelerating development and distribution of a potential treatment option for COVID-19. In parallel, the Alliance has confirmed it will work with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the NIH to test the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the hyperimmune therapy in adult patients with COVID-19.\u00a0This global study is currently anticipated to start in the summer and will form the foundation for the potential regulatory approval of the hyperimmune therapy.\u00a0 \u201cHyperimmune globulin therapy has the potential to be one of the earliest treatment options for COVID-19, and we look forward to working with NIAID and health authorities to bring this therapy to patients as early as possible,\u201d said Bill Mezzanotte, Executive Vice President, Head of R&D, CSL Behring and Co-leader of the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance. \u201cOne of the stated goals of the alliance is to be an effective partner for important institutions such as NIAID and also to help develop coherent regulatory strategies that can give global health authorities the confidence to streamline the approval process of hyperimmune globulin therapy for COVID-19.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Key to developing this potential hyperimmune globulin treatment is the collection of convalescent plasma. To amplify awareness, the Alliance has gained support from large organizations outside of the plasma industry. Examples of those offering resources to the Alliance include Microsoft and Uber Health. Microsoft is providing technology support, including the Alliance website and the Plasmabot for donor recruitment. The Plasmabot streamlines the process for a potential donor to quickly gain information about their nearest collection center from across the member network. In parallel, Uber Health has agreed to donate 25,000 round-trip rides to transport potentially eligible donors to and from plasma collection centers. These rides will be coordinated by the plasma collection center directly for individuals with confirmed appointments. \u201cPartnership and collaboration are critical to the success of the CoVIg-19 program,\u201d said Julie Kim, President of Plasma-Derived Therapies Business Unit, Takeda, and co-leader of the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance. \u201cWe now have enough plasma to initiate clinical manufacturing, but more is needed to ensure both speed and scale. The growing and active involvement of leading companies from outside the plasma industry, who support this Alliance as well as convalescent plasma for transfusion initiatives \u2013 demonstrates the potential of convalescent plasma to fight this public health crisis. Together, we all share the same goal \u2013 to save lives by using the power of convalescent plasma in different ways.\u201d  The success of the CoVig-19 program depends heavily right now on the support of people across the world to donate convalescent plasma. We encourage those who have recovered from COVID-19 and who are interested in contributing to our development program \u2013 or to any other \u2013 by donating their plasma to visit the website for more information.  ### About ADMA Biologics, Inc.

The study also evaluated the feasibility of manual push administration with Hizentra, a new method that would eliminate the need for an infusion pump to administer the SCIg. The research, originally scheduled to be presented at the 2020 AAAAI Annual Meeting that was canceled due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was published in an online supplement to The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Results of three analyses, all stemming from the HILO (Hizentra Label Optimization) study, conducted by CSL Behring, were also published in the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) online poster library: Poster 097, Poster 697 and Poster 699. \u201cPeople living with PI must carefully manage their health with regular infusions of Ig therapy. As such, we are looking for solutions to ease the treatment burden and simplify the process,\u201d said John Anderson, M.D., Research Director, Alabama Allergy & Asthma Center. \u201cWith this new research, there is data to support that Hizentra can be safely infused at a faster flow rate or higher volume than previously approved, potentially offering patients shorter infusion times, a potential decrease in the number of needle sticks and greater flexibility for them to individualize their infusion experience.\u201d In the study, researchers evaluated patients in three cohorts, the pump-assisted flow rate cohort with a baseline infusion rate of 25 mL\/hour per injection site, pump-assisted volume cohort with a baseline infusion volume of 25 mL per injection site and manual push flow rate cohort with a baseline infusion rate of 0.5 mL\/minute (30 mL\/hour per injection site). Positive results were observed from the expanded infusion parameters of Hizentra for most patients across all three cohorts. \u201cUnderstanding the needs of patients with PI and how we can improve their treatment experience by optimizing our therapies is a critical focus for us,\u201d said Mittie Doyle, M.D., Vice President, Research and Development, Immunology Therapeutic Area at CSL Behring.\u00a0\u201cThis study is yet another example of how we are delivering on our promise to patients with PI to help them better manage their health challenges.\u201d  About the HILO Study A multicenter, open-label, parallel-arm, non-randomized study, HILO enrolled 49 adult and pediatric patients with PI who were on a stable dose of Hizentra therapy. Patients were enrolled in either a pump-assisted volume cohort (n=15), pump-assisted flow rate cohort (n=18) or manual push administration flow rate cohort (n=16). Assignments were based on prior experience with pump-assisted infusions or manual push administration infusions. The primary endpoint was the responder rate within each cohort and for each infusion parameter level; secondary endpoints examined safety and tolerability. For the two pump-assisted cohorts, responder rates were defined as the percentage of patients who successfully completed \u226575% of planned infusions. For the manual push administration cohort, responder rates were defined as the percentage of patients who completed at least 60% of infusions at each flow rate and who completed the full dose per scheduled infusion without interruptions for any reason. Each cohort tested increasing infusion levels of Hizentra. After four consecutive weeks of receiving the same infusion level, qualifying participants moved to the next higher infusion level. Each infusion parameter level was tested for four weeks, after which responders were switched to the next level. The cohorts included:  Pump-assisted volume cohort (which consisted of weekly infusions, with volume per injection site of 25 mL, 40 mL and 50 mL)  Pump-assisted flow rate cohort (which consisted of weekly infusions, with flow rate per injection site of 25 mL\/hour, 50 mL\/hour, 75 mL\/hour and 100 mL\/hour) Manual push administration flow rate cohort (which consisted of two to seven infusions per week, with flow rate per injection site of 0.5mL\/minute (30 mL\/hour), 1 mL\/minute (60 mL\/hour) and 2 mL\/minute (120 mL\/hour).  Study Results Researchers observed the following results and responder rates for the three cohorts.  Pump-assisted cohort results:   Responder rates for the pump-assisted volume cohort were 86.7% (25 mL) and 73.3% (40 and 50 mL), while responder rates for the pump-assisted flow rate cohort were 77.8% (25 and 50 mL\/hour), 66.7% (75 mL\/hour) and 61.1% (100 mL\/hour).  Dose and volume adherence rates were \u226590% in all patients of the volume cohort, and 83.3% in patients in the flow rate cohort (<90% in three patients). Mean serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) trough levels (g\/L) were similar between Day 1 and end of the study for the volume cohort and the flow rate cohort.   Manual push administration cohort results:   Responder rates were 100% (0.5 and 1 mL\/minute) and 87.5% (2 mL\/minute), with 98.5-100% of infusions completed per the planned schedule. Compliance rates were \u226590% in all patients but one. Mean serum IgG trough levels were similar between Day 1 and the end of the study.    The final analysis examined the rate of treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) frequency, type, intensity or duration across all three cohorts. Low rates of TEAEs\/infusion were observed across all cohorts, with mild to moderate infusion site reaction being the most common. Specifically, TEAE rates\/infusion were 0.145, 0.228 and 0.085 in the pump-assisted volume cohort, pump-assisted flow rate cohort and manual push administration flow rate cohort, respectively. There was no clinically meaningful difference in TEAE frequency, type, intensity or duration among the three cohorts and rates of TEAEs\/infusion did not increase with expanded infusion parameters. About Primary Immunodeficiency (PI) PI diseases are a group of more than 400 rare, chronic disorders in which part of the body's immune system is missing or malfunctioning. Patients with PI commonly have frequent infections, reoccurring infections, infections that won't go away or unusually severe infections. As a result, patients may face repeated rounds of antibiotics or be hospitalized for treatment. Many people living with PI have missed school, work or time with family and friends. About Hizentra\u00ae  Registered in more than 60 countries, Hizentra is the world's most prescribed subcutaneous immune globulin to treat PI, and has a proven track record of safety, efficacy and tolerability, with more than 6.7 million exposures worldwide since 2010. Hizentra was first approved by the U.S. FDA in March 2010 for the treatment of patients with PI and was approved in March 2018 for the treatment of adults with Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) to prevent relapse of neuromuscular disability and impairment. For more information about Hizentra, including the U.S. prescribing information, visit www.hizentra.com. CSL Behring: Continuing to Innovate as a World Leader in Immune Globulin Therapies\u00a0  CSL Behring is a world leader in immune globulin therapies with the longest-standing history in plasma-derived therapies of any immune globulin manufacturer. The company\u2019s continuous pursuit of research and product innovation has been a catalyst for industry-wide breakthroughs, including the introduction of the first 20% subcutaneous immune globulin for patients with PI. That innovation continues today with the promise to continually better the treatment experience for patients.\u00a0 Important Safety Information for the U.S. Hizentra\u00ae, Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human), 20% Liquid, is indicated for:  Treatment of primary immunodeficiency (PI) in adults and pediatric patients 2 years and older. Maintenance therapy in adults with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) to prevent relapse of neuromuscular disability and impairment.   Limitation of Use: Maintenance therapy in CIDP has been systematically studied for 6 months and for a further 12 months in a follow-up study. Continued maintenance beyond these periods should be individualized based on patient response and need for continued therapy.    For subcutaneous infusion only. WARNING: Thrombosis may occur with immune globulin products, including Hizentra. Risk factors may include: advanced age, prolonged immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous or arterial thrombosis, use of estrogens, indwelling vascular catheters, hyperviscosity, and cardiovascular risk factors. For patients at risk of thrombosis, administer Hizentra at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable. Ensure adequate hydration in patients before administration. Monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity. Hizentra is contraindicated in patients with a history of anaphylactic or severe systemic reaction to human immune globulin (Ig) or components of Hizentra (eg, polysorbate 80), as well as in patients with immunoglobulin A deficiency with antibodies against IgA and a history of hypersensitivity. Because Hizentra contains L-proline as stabilizer, use in patients with hyperprolinemia is contraindicated. IgA-deficient patients with anti-IgA antibodies are at greater risk of severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. Thrombosis may occur following treatment with Ig products, including Hizentra. Monitor patients for aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS), which may occur following treatment with Ig products, including Hizentra. In patients at risk of acute renal failure, monitor renal function, including blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine and urine output. In addition, monitor patients for clinical signs of hemolysis or pulmonary adverse reactions (eg, transfusion-related acute lung injury [TRALI]). Hizentra is derived from human blood. The risk of transmission of infectious agents, including viruses and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent and its variant (vCJD), cannot be completely eliminated. The most common adverse reactions (observed in 5% of study subjects) were local infusion-site reactions, as well as headache, diarrhea, fatigue, back pain, nausea, extremity pain, cough, upper respiratory tract infection, rash, pruritus, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, migraine, arthralgia, pain, fall, and nasopharyngitis. The passive transfer of antibodies can interfere with response to live virus vaccines and lead to misinterpretation of serologic test results.

The partnership joins the forces of CSL Behring\u2019s leading protein science capabilities with SAB\u2019s novel immunotherapy platform capable of rapidly developing and producing natural, highly-targeted, high-potency, fully human polyclonal antibodies without the need for blood plasma donations from recovered patients.  The therapeutic candidate, SAB-185, is generated from SAB\u2019s proprietary DiversitAb\u2122 platform producing large volumes of human polyclonal antibodies targeted specifically to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Driven by advanced genetic engineering and antibody science, SAB\u2019s novel approach, leveraging genetically engineered cattle to produce fully human antibodies, enables a scalable and reliable production of targeted, higher potency neutralizing antibody product than has been previously possible. SAB\u2019s approach has expedited the rapid development of a novel immunotherapy for COVID-19 deploying the same natural immune response to fight the disease as recovered patients, but with a much higher concentration of targeted antibodies.   \"COVID-19 is a nearly unprecedented public health crisis,\u201d said CSL Behring\u2019s Executive Vice President and Head of R&D Bill Mezzanotte, M.D. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re combining our leading capabilities in plasma product development and immunology with external collaborators to help find multiple, rapid solutions.\u00a0In the near-term, SAB Biotherapeutics\u2019 novel immunotherapy platform provides a new and innovative solution to rapidly respond without the need for human plasma adding a different dimension to the industry-wide plasma-derived hyperimmune alliance\u00a0effort we recently launched for the COVID-19 crisis. For future pandemics, SAB's platform may allow us to even more rapidly respond to patients' needs.\"  \u201cOur targeted high-potency immunotherapies leverage the native immune response thereby providing a highly-specific match against the complexity, diversity and mutation of a disease,\u201d said Eddie J.

CSL Behring awarded Cecelia Yates, Ph.D., from the University of Pittsburgh, and Eleftherios (Terry) Papoutsakis, Ph.D., from the University of Delaware, $250,000 each and an opportunity to work alongside the plasma-based biotech\u2019s own experts in an effort to help transform their ideas into groundbreaking therapies to improve patients\u2019 health. CSL Behring, a global leader in treating rare and serious diseases which has its global operational headquarters in King of Prussia, PA, identified the medical researchers utilizing the Science Center\u2019s, sourcing innovation framework for technology commercialization, support and infrastructure to efficiently evaluate technologies from multiple institutions. \u201cCongratulations Drs. Yates and Papoutsakis on being the first recipients of the CSL Behring-Science Center Research Acceleration Initiative,\u201d said Bill Mezzanotte, MD, Executive Vice President, Head of Research and Development for CSL Behring. \u201cThis initiative is another example of the strength of our partnership with the Philadelphia-based University City Science Center as we look in our \u2018backyard\u2019 for innovative scientific advancements that have the potential to help rare disease patients lead full lives. Our growing R&D organization looks forward to working with Dr. Yates and Dr. Papoutsakis in the years ahead to advance their scientific research.\u201d \u201cThe Science Center couldn\u2019t be more excited about facilitating the introduction between these talented investigators and CSL Behring,\u201d says John Younger, MD, Vice President of Science & Technology at the Science Center. \u201cOur network of universities, biotech, and pharmaceutical companies was built exactly for making these connections not just possible but easy.\u00a0 Supporting the development of new biologics, and new drug and gene delivery systems like those developed by Drs. Papoutsakis and Yates will continue to be an important focus of our team.\u201d The investigators and technologies selected in this inaugural round of the program include: Cecelia Yates, Ph.D., University of Pittsburgh, for the use of FibroKine\u2122 biomimetic peptides as potential targeted therapeutic treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. Fibrotic diseases constitute a significant health problem in the US with the ability to impact any organ that is scarred from chronic disease, including the heart, lung, liver, arteries, and skin. In some cases, progressive and life-threatening diseases follow, but effective therapies don\u2019t yet exist. In response, Dr. Yates has developed FibroKine\u2122, a chemokine-based class of biomimetic peptides that are potential therapeutic agents for the targeted treatment of tissue fibrosis. Support from CSL Behring will allow the Yates group to test FibroKine\u2122 peptide ability to effectively treat and halt the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. Eleftherios (Terry) Papoutsakis, Ph.D., University of Delaware, for exploring the use of cell derived micro-particles and vesicles (MkMPs) for the treatment of thrombocytopenias and in stem-cell targeted gene therapies Gene delivery to or editing of Hematopoietic (blood) Stem and Progenitor Cells (HSPCs) can provide therapeutic benefit to patients for a variety of genetic hematological disorders, ranging from low platelet count diseases to primary immune deficiencies like Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. With the support of CSL Behring, Dr. Papoutsakis will investigate the use of human MkMPs: 1) to promote in vivo platelet biogenesis as a potential treatment for thrombocytopenias, and 2) for the in vivo delivery of DNA, RNA, and proteins to HSPCs in gene therapy applications. In October 2018, the Science Center and CSL Behring joined forces to identify promising technologies and support the commercialization pathways of potential new discoveries. Researchers at academic and research institutions throughout the region were invited to submit proposals for projects with a focus on therapeutics that fit within CSL Behring\u2019s five therapeutic areas of expertise: immunology and neurology; hematology and thrombosis; respiratory; cardiovascular and metabolic; and transplant. Following the success of the initial pilot, the CSL Behring \u2013 Science Center Research Initiative has expanded and is currently accepting applications from researchers at 28 institutions across six states with awardees to receive up to $400,000 each.

SSc is a chronic and potentially life-threatening autoimmune disorder characterized by a build-up of scar tissue (fibrosis) in the skin and other organs.1 It affects approximately 100,000 people in the U.S.2 There are currently no FDA-approved,\u00a0 disease-modifying treatments to stop or reverse the overall course of the disease.  The FDA Office of Orphan Products Development (OOPD) grants orphan-drug designation to novel drugs or biologics that treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 U.S. patients. The designation qualifies companies that invest in research and development of these medications for a range of incentives, including fee waivers, tax credits and the potential for marketing exclusivity upon approval. \u201cCSL Behring is driven by our promise to develop and deliver innovative therapies for patients with the highest unmet need,\u201d said Mittie Doyle, Vice President, Research and Development, Immunology and Neurology Therapeutic Area at CSL Behring. \u201cReceiving orphan drug designation for Privigen as an investigational SSc therapy is an important milestone in our quest to address the devastating impact of systemic sclerosis.\u201d Privigen is currently approved in the U.S. to treat patients with primary immunodeficiency (PI), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).\u00a0 CSL Behring recently initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Privigen in the treatment of adults with SSc, and in October 2019 received Fast Track Designation for the clinical development of Privigen for the treatment of serious pulmonary, skin, and musculoskeletal manifestations resulting from this condition. The FDA confers Fast Track designation to aid and expedite the development and review of drugs that show promise in treating a serious or life-threatening disease and address an unmet medical need. About Systemic Sclerosis Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a rare, chronic, and potentially life-threatening autoimmune rheumatic disease characterized by the buildup of scar tissue or fibrosis resulting in hardening, thickening and tightening of the skin. In SSc, fibrosis can also affect internal organs, such as the esophagus, heart, lungs, and kidneys, often leading to their impairment or failure.1 SSc affects approximately 100,000 people in the United States, with females being four times more likely to develop the condition than males. Other factors, such as race and ethnicity, may also influence the risk of getting SSc, the age of onset and the pattern and severity of internal organ involvement.1-2 About Privigen\u00ae Privigen\u00ae is the first and only 10 percent, ready-to-use, liquid IVIg stabilized with proline, a naturally occurring amino acid. Privigen was first approved in 2007 in U.S. for the treatment of patients with primary immunodeficiency (PI) and chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in patients age 15 years and older. Since September 2017, Privigen has also been indicated for the maintenance treatment of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) in adults and is available in more than 60 countries around the world to treat these and other rare diseases. For more information about Privigen, including the U.S. Prescribing Information, visit www.privigen.com. Important Safety Information Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human), 10% Liquid, Privigen\u00ae, is indicated for the treatment of:  Primary humoral immunodeficiency (PI) Chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in patients age 15 years and older Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) in adults   Limitation of use: maintenance therapy in CIDP has not been studied for periods longer than 6 months. Individualize duration of treatment beyond 6 months based on patient response.    WARNING: THROMBOSIS, RENAL DYSFUNCTION AND ACUTE RENAL FAILURE  Thrombosis may occur with immune globulin products, including Privigen. Risk factors may include advanced age, prolonged immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous or arterial thrombosis, use of estrogens, indwelling vascular catheters, hyperviscosity, and cardiovascular risk factors. Renal dysfunction, acute renal failure, osmotic nephrosis, and death may occur with immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) products in predisposed patients. Renal dysfunction and acute renal failure occur more commonly in patients receiving IGIV products that contain sucrose. Privigen does not contain sucrose. For patients at risk of thrombosis, renal dysfunction or renal failure, administer Privigen at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable. Ensure adequate hydration in patients before administration. Monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity.  See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Privigen is contraindicated in patients with history of anaphylactic or severe systemic reaction to human immune globulin, in patients with hyperprolinemia, and in IgA-deficient patients with antibodies to IgA and a history of hypersensitivity.  In patients at risk of developing acute renal failure, monitor urine output and renal function, including blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine. Hyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity, or hyponatremia can occur with Privigen. Infrequently, aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) may occur\u2014especially with high doses or rapid infusion. Hemolysis, either intravascular or due to enhanced red blood cell sequestration, may occur. Risk factors include non-O blood group and high doses. Closely monitor patients for hemolysis and hemolytic anemia.  During and shortly following Privigen infusion, elevations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (including cases of hypertensive urgency) have been observed. These elevations resolved or significantly improved within hours with oral anti-hypertensive therapy or observation alone. Check patients for a history of hypertension and monitor blood pressure during this period. Consider relative risks and benefits before prescribing high-dose regimen for chronic ITP and CIDP in patients at increased risk of thrombosis, hemolysis, acute kidney injury or volume overload. Monitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions (transfusion-related acute lung injury [TRALI]). Privigen is derived from human plasma. The risk of transmission of infectious agents, including viruses and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent and its variant (vCJD), cannot be completely eliminated. In clinical studies of patients with PI, the most common adverse reactions to Privigen, observed in >5% of subjects, were headache, fatigue, nausea, chills, vomiting, back pain, pain, elevated body temperature, abdominal pain, diarrhea, cough, stomach discomfort, chest pain, joint swelling\/effusion, influenza-like illness, pharyngolaryngeal pain, urticaria, and dizziness. Serious adverse reactions were hypersensitivity, chills, fatigue, dizziness, and increased body temperature. In clinical studies of patients being treated for chronic ITP, the most common adverse reactions, seen in >5% of subjects, were laboratory findings consistent with hemolysis, headache, elevated body temperature, anemia, nausea, and vomiting. A serious adverse reaction was aseptic meningitis syndrome. In clinical studies of patients being treated for CIDP, the most common reactions, observed in >5% of subjects, were headache, asthenia, hypertension, nausea, pain in extremity, hemolysis, influenza-like illness, leukopenia, and rash. Serious adverse reactions were hemolysis, exacerbation of CIDP, acute rash, increased diastolic blood pressure, hypersensitivity, pulmonary embolism, respiratory failure, and migraine. Treatment with Privigen might interfere with a patient\u2019s response to live virus vaccines and could lead to misinterpretation of serologic testing. In patients over 65 and those at risk of renal insufficiency, do not exceed recommended dose and infuse at the minimum rate practicable.

Published today in Science, the research team from the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity (Doherty Institute), the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Institute and CSL Limited say this breakthrough of discovering how gamma-delta T cells become activated addresses a question that has baffled scientists for 25 years.  The study by University of Melbourne\u2019s Marc Rigau, PhD student at the Doherty Institute, was co-led by Dr Adam Uldrich, a Senior Research Fellow at the Doherty Institute, Professor Dale Godfrey a laboratory head at the Doherty Institute, and Dr Andreas Behren, a Laboratory Head from the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Institute.  Dr Uldrich explained that gamma-delta T cells are known to respond to the presence of small molecules, known as phosphoantigens, that are produced by bacteria and cancer cells.  \u201cThis leads to the activation of these gamma-delta T cells and often eradication of the diseased cells.\u201d  Professor Godfrey said \u201cUp until now, scientists have struggled to understand the fundamental question of how phosphoantigens are detected by gamma-delta T cells.\u201d   \u201cWe found that molecules on the surface of the gamma-delta T cells, called T cell receptors, bind to another molecule called butyrophilin 2A1 that is present on many different cell types throughout the body, including cancer cells.\u201d  Dr Behren said \u201cThese findings represent a key advance in our understanding of how gamma-delta T cells function to protect us from disease.\u201d   \u201cThe research team believes that this breakthrough could ultimately lead to the development of new and improved immunotherapy treatments for millions of people worldwide impacted by cancer and infection.\u201d   The research is the result of a collaboration between the Doherty Institute, the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Institute, and CSL Limited.  \u201cThis research project demonstrates the power of collaboration between academia and industry. Nearly a decade ago, we identified Butyrophilin 2A1 as a potential therapeutic target but its precise biological function remained elusive,\u201d said Dr Con Panousis, Senior Director Molecular Biology, CSL Limited and an author on the paper.  \u201cThis discovery makes a significant contribution to our understanding of how gamma-delta T cells work and in doing so, paves the way for translating this research into new immunotherapies for the treatment of serious human disease.\u201d   The collaborators have filed patents surrounding their discovery. Note to editors: All researchers are available for interview, as well as Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research Centre patient James Doulis. Please note, the discovery detailed in this release is NOT available as a treatment. Mr Doulis can speak to the importance of research from a patient perspective About the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity Finding solutions to prevent, treat and cure infectious diseases and understanding the complexities of the immune system requires innovative approaches and concentrated effort.

CIDP is a\u00a0rare autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nerves and has the potential to cause significant disability. Hizentra was approved by the FDA in March 2018 for the treatment of adults with CIDP to prevent relapse of neuromuscular disability and impairment.\u00a0 It is the first and only 20 percent subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg) approved for this indication. The approval was based on data from the Phase III\u00a0PATH\u00a0(Polyneuropathy\u00a0And\u00a0Treatment with\u00a0Hizentra) study, the largest controlled clinical study in CIDP patients to date. In the PATH trial, patients taking Hizentra relapsed or withdrew less often than those taking placebo. Patients in the study also maintained their grip strength as well as upper and lower body strength. The FDA\u2019s decision regarding the orphan drug status of Hizentra provides CSL Behring a seven- year period of U.S. marketing exclusivity for Hizentra in the maintenance treatment of CIDP with SCIg. The FDA Office of Orphan Products Development grants orphan designation for novel drugs or biologics that treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the U.S. and qualifies incentives for companies that invest in research and development of these medications. \u201cOrphan drug exclusivity is a significant milestone for the CSL Behring team committed to delivering Hizentra and improving the lives of patients diagnosed with CIDP,\u201d said Bob Lojewski, Senior Vice President and General Manager, North America, CSL Behring. \u201cWe are proud to be the only company to offer an innovative portfolio of subcutaneous and intravenous immunoglobulin therapies for CIDP. Driven by our promise, we will continue our work to fulfill the needs of patients with serious conditions like CIDP.\u201d About Hizentra  Registered in more than 60 countries, Hizentra is the world's most prescribed SCIg and has a proven track record of safety, efficacy, and tolerability, with more than 6.7 million exposures worldwide since 2010. Hizentra was first approved by the U.S. FDA in March 2010 for the treatment of patients with primary immunodeficiency (PI). \u00a0For more information about Hizentra, including the U.S. prescribing information, visit www.hizentra.com. About CIDP CIDP is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nerves (those outside the brain and spinal cord) and damages the protective covering of the nerves known as the myelin sheath. This may result in numbness or tingling, muscle weakness, fatigue, and other symptoms. CIDP effects can worsen over time, leading to significant activity limitations and a decreased quality of life. CIDP can occur at any age and is more common in men than in women. The GBS\/CIDP Foundation estimates that approximately 30 percent of CIDP patients will progress to wheelchair dependence if not treated. The Foundation also estimates that the incidence of CIDP in the U.S. is as high as two in 100,000 people each year, with the accumulation of cases over time resulting in prevalence as high as nine in 100,000 in some areas.  Important Hizentra Safety Information for the U.S. Hizentra\u00ae, Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human), 20% Liquid, is indicated for: Treatment of primary immunodeficiency (PI) in adults and pediatric patients 2 years and older. Maintenance therapy in adults with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) to prevent relapse of neuromuscular disability and impairment. Limitation of use: Maintenance therapy in CIDP has been systematically studied for 6 months and for a further 12 months in a follow-up study. Continued maintenance beyond these periods should be individualized based on patient response and need for continued therapy. For subcutaneous infusion only.  WARNING: Thrombosis may occur with immune globulin products, including Hizentra. Risk factors may include: advanced age, prolonged immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous or arterial thrombosis, use of estrogens, indwelling vascular catheters, hyperviscosity, and cardiovascular risk factors. For patients at risk of thrombosis, administer Hizentra at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable. Ensure adequate hydration in patients before administration. Monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity. Hizentra is contraindicated in patients with a history of anaphylactic or severe systemic reaction to human immune globulin (Ig) or components of Hizentra (eg, polysorbate 80), as well as in patients with immunoglobulin A deficiency with antibodies against IgA and a history of hypersensitivity. Because Hizentra contains L-proline as stabilizer, use in patients with hyperprolinemia is contraindicated.  IgA-deficient patients with anti-IgA antibodies are at greater risk of severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. Thrombosis may occur following treatment with Ig products, including Hizentra.  Monitor patients for aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS), which may occur following treatment with Ig products, including Hizentra. In patients at risk of acute renal failure, monitor renal function, including blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine and urine output. In addition, monitor patients for clinical signs of hemolysis or pulmonary adverse reactions (eg, transfusion-related acute lung injury [TRALI]). Hizentra is derived from human blood. The risk of transmission of infectious agents, including viruses and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent and its variant (vCJD), cannot be completely eliminated.  The most common adverse reactions (observed in \u22655% of study subjects) were local infusion-site reactions, as well as headache, diarrhea, fatigue, back pain, nausea, extremity pain, cough, upper respiratory tract infection, rash, pruritus, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, migraine, arthralgia, pain, fall, and nasopharyngitis.  The passive transfer of antibodies can interfere with response to live virus vaccines and lead to misinterpretation of serologic test results.  Please see full prescribing information for Hizentra.

At CSL\u2019s annual R&D briefing to investors, Dr. Mezzanotte noted the company is building on its leadership in plasma therapies through the identification of emerging new medicines from both within its existing portfolio of plasma-derived products, and through newer platforms such as gene and cell therapies and recombinant proteins.  To support this approach, CSL has forged targeted innovation partnerships in close proximity to its R&D locations, including at the Bio21 Institute in Melbourne, Australia, the Swiss Center for Translational Medicine in Bern, Switzerland and the University City Science Center in Philadelphia, US.  \u201cOur Phase 3 clinical program targeting the reduction of early recurrent cardiovascular events in heart attack survivors, CSL112, continues to track well,\u201d said Dr. Mezzanotte. \u201cWe continue our focus on developing new medical indications for immunoglobulins while improving manufacturing efficiencies across our plasma product portfolio.\u201d\u00a0  In FY19, CSL invested US$832 million into its R&D portfolio, representing 9.7% of total revenues.  R&D Pipeline Highlights  A novel treatment for asthma which has this month advanced to Phase 1, first-in-human trials for patients with mild to moderate asthma. Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease that is estimated to affect as many as 235 million1 people worldwide and is the most common chronic disease among children. Despite advances in the treatment of asthma, it is estimated that every year, more than 1,0002 people around the world die each day from this disease.   1 World Health Organisation: https:\/\/who.int\/respiratory\/asthma\/en\/\u00a0\u00a0  2The Global Asthma Report 2018: http:\/\/globalasthmareport.org\/burden\/mortality.php  The potential therapy, which currently holds the working title \u201cCSL311,\u201d is a monoclonal antibody that targets multiple inflammatory agents involved in various diseases.  CSL311 is the first monoclonal antibody to simultaneously target three cell-signaling cytokines, or molecules, that are responsible for the immune response that causes asthma and in doing so, suppresses inflammation of airways.  Addressing Severe Muscle Disease  Another pipeline project featured today is a Phase 3 clinical trial for novel use of CSL Behring\u2018s existing subcutaneous Immunoglobulin (Ig) product in patients with a severe condition called Dermatomyositis. The Ig product is currently indicated for use in a rare neurological disorder, Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) as well as primary and secondary immunodeficiencies.  Dermatomyositis is one of a group of acquired muscle diseases called inflammatory myopathies which are characterized by chronic muscle inflammation accompanied by muscle weakness. If the disease goes untreated it can lead to difficulty in walking or the need for a wheelchair or even becoming bedridden.  \u201cOur pipeline is as robust and promising as ever,\u201d Dr. Mezzanotte said. \u201cOur R&D portfolio holds the potential to unlock a broad range of new therapies for people with challenging medical conditions.

AFSTYLA\u00ae Important Safety Information AFSTYLA\u00ae, Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Single Chain, is used to treat and control bleeding episodes in people with hemophilia A. Used regularly (prophylaxis), AFSTYLA can reduce the number of bleeding episodes and the risk of joint damage due to bleeding. Your doctor might also give you AFSTYLA before surgical procedures. AFSTYLA is administered by intravenous injection into the bloodstream, and can be self-administered or administered by a caregiver. Your healthcare provider or hemophilia treatment center will instruct you on how to do an infusion. Carefully follow prescriber instructions regarding dose and infusion schedule, which are based on your weight and the severity of your condition. Do not use AFSTYLA if you know you are allergic to any of its ingredients, or to hamster proteins. Tell your healthcare provider if you previously had an allergic reaction to any product containing Factor VIII (FVIII), or have been told you have inhibitors to FVIII, as AFSTYLA might not work for you. Inform your healthcare provider of all medical conditions and problems you have, as well as all medications you are taking. Immediately stop treatment and contact your healthcare provider if you see signs of an allergic reaction, including a rash or hives, itching, tightness of chest or throat, difficulty breathing, lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, or a decrease in blood pressure. Your body can make antibodies, called inhibitors, against FVIII, which could stop AFSTYLA from working properly. You might need to be tested for inhibitors from time to time. Contact your healthcare provider if bleeding does not stop after taking AFSTYLA. In clinical trials, dizziness and allergic reactions were the most common side effects. However, these are not the only side effects possible. Tell your healthcare provider about any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. Please see full prescribing information for AFSTYLA, including patient product information. \u00a0 IDELVION\u00ae Important Safety Information IDELVION\u00ae, Coagulation Factor IX (Recombinant), Albumin Fusion Protein (rFIX-FP), is used to control and prevent bleeding episodes in people with hemophilia B. Your doctor might also give you IDELVION before surgical procedures. Used regularly as prophylaxis, IDELVION can reduce number of bleeding episodes. IDELVION is administered by intravenous injection into the bloodstream, and can be self-administered or administered by a caregiver. Do not inject IDELVION without training and approval from your healthcare provider or hemophilia treatment center.  Tell your healthcare provider of any medical condition you might have, including allergies and pregnancy, as well as all medications you are taking. Do not use IDELVION if you know you are allergic to any of its ingredients, including hamster proteins. Tell your doctor if you previously had an allergic reaction to any FIX product. Stop treatment and immediately contact your healthcare provider if you see signs of an allergic reaction, including a rash or hives, itching, tightness of chest or throat, difficulty breathing, lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, or a decrease in blood pressure. Your body can make antibodies, called inhibitors, against Factor IX, which could stop IDELVION from working properly. You might need to be tested for inhibitors from time to time. IDELVION might also increase the risk of abnormal blood clots in your body, especially if you have risk factors. Call your healthcare provider if you have chest pain, difficulty breathing, or leg tenderness or swelling. In clinical trials for IDELVION, headache was the only side effect occurring in more than 1% of patients (1.8%), but is not the only side effect possible. Tell your healthcare provider about any side effect that bothers you or does not go away, or if bleeding is not controlled with IDELVION. Please see full US prescribing information for IDELVION, including patient product information. About CSL Behring CSL Behring is a global biotherapeutics leader driven by its promise to save lives.

CSL Behring is the only company to offer a portfolio of biologics to address the unique needs of CIDP patients in several regions around the world \u2013 Hizentra\u00ae, the first and only subcutaneous immunoglobulin option for CIDP patients, while Privigen\u00ae is the first and only 10 percent, ready-to-use, room-temperature stored, liquid intravenous immunoglobulin stabilized with proline.\u00a0 Earlier this year, both Hizentra and Privigen were approved by Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for the treatment of patients with CIDP. About CIDP In CIDP, a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nerves (those outside the brain and spinal cord), the myelin sheath, critical for impulse conductivity in nerve cells, is damaged. This may result in numbness or tingling, muscle weakness, fatigue, and other symptoms. CIDP effects can worsen over time, leading to significant activity limitations and a decreased quality of life. CIDP can occur at any age and is more common in men than in women. Approximately 30 percent of CIDP patients will progress to wheelchair dependence if not treated [i]. The incidence of CIDP each year is estimated to be between 1.5 and 3.6 million within the global population [ii]. About Hizentra\u00ae Hizentra [Human normal immunoglobulin (SCIG)], the first 20 percent SCIG developed for subcutaneous use, is available in more than 45 countries to treat certain immune deficiencies and as a maintenance treatment for CIDP. Hizentra, the world's most prescribed SCIG, has a proven track record of safety, efficacy and tolerability and has over 6 million exposures worldwide since 2010. About Privigen\u00ae Privigen [Human normal immunoglobulin (IVIG)] is a 10 percent, ready to use, liquid IVIG stabilized with proline. A naturally occurring amino acid, proline has been shown to reduce IgG aggregation and dimer formation. It is available in more than 60 countries around the world and is used as replacement therapy for patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, and as an immunomodulatory therapy for patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), Kawasaki disease, and neurological disorders such as CIDP, multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.

The 4- and 5-gram packaging reduces the number of vials necessary for reconstitution, thereby adding convenience by saving patient\u2019s time and reducing waste.  ZEMAIRA dosing is weight-based, so a patient weighing 184 pounds currently requires five 1-gram vials.\u00a0 With the larger vial sizes, a majority of patients will be able to streamline their preparation of ZEMAIRA to a single vial per dose, saving time and reducing waste by requiring them to reconstitute and pool fewer vials.\u00a0 Room temperature storage coupled with the new larger vial sizes eases the burden of Alpha 1 therapy. \u201cMany Alpha 1 patients already experience the burden of weekly infusions,\u201d said Dr. Robert Sandhaus, MD, PhD, FCCP, Clinical Director, Alpha 1 Foundation and Medical Director, AlphaNet. \u201cThese larger vial sizes of ZEMAIRA are an improvement that could make it much easier for patients by simplifying the steps necessary for preparation of their therapy.\u201d \u201cWe listened to our patients and are proud to address an unmet need for a new option that streamlines and expedites their current treatment regimen,\u201d adds Laurel Omert, MD, Medical Director, Specialty Products, North America, CSL Behring. \u201cThe addition of these larger vials to the ZEMAIRA family builds on our long history of innovation and commitment to the Alpha 1 community.\u201d  ZEMAIRA, a natural Alpha 1 protein derived from human plasma, has been proven to raise and maintain serum levels of alpha 1 antitrypsin protein (AAT) in patients. It has been available in the US market for over 15 years and is manufactured in Kankakee, Illinois. About Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency  Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency is a hereditary condition that can severely affect a patient\u2019s lung function. The condition is marked by a low level or absence of AAT, a natural protein that inhibits neutrophil elastase, thereby preventing destruction of lung tissue. Severe deficiency of AAT is associated with a strong tendency for the development of emphysema, a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and can significantly impact everyday life and life expectancy. About ZEMAIRA\u00ae ZEMAIRA is a highly-purified form of AAT (human) currently approved in the US, Canada, Brazil, and New Zealand, where it is indicated for chronic augmentation and maintenance therapy in adults with Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency and clinical evidence of emphysema.\u00a0 CSL Behring markets ZEMAIRA as Respreeza\u00ae in Europe. Important Safety Information Alpha1-Proteinase Inhibitor (Human), ZEMAIRA is indicated to raise the plasma level of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (A1-PI) in patients with A1-PI deficiency and related emphysema. The effect of this raised level on the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations and the progression of emphysema have not been established in clinical trials. ZEMAIRA may not be suitable for everyone; for example, people with known hypersensitivity to components used to make ZEMAIRA, those with a history of anaphylaxis or severe systemic response to A1-PI products, and those with certain IgA deficiencies. If you think any of these may apply to you, ask your doctor. Early signs of hypersensitivity reactions to ZEMAIRA include hives, rash, tightness of the chest, unusual breathing difficulty, wheezing, and feeling faint. Immediately discontinue use and consult with physician if such symptoms occur. In clinical studies, the following adverse reactions were reported in at least 5% of subjects receiving ZEMAIRA: headache, sinusitis, upper respiratory infection, bronchitis, fatigue, increased cough, fever, injection-site bleeding, nasal symptoms, sore throat, and swelled blood vessels. Because ZEMAIRA is made from human blood, the risk of transmitting infectious agents, including viruses and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent and its variant (vCJD), cannot be completely eliminated.

The studies showed that 73 percent (PATH) and 61 percent (PRIMA) of patients responded to Privigen as measured by their adjusted score on the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) scale, which measures the ability to walk and perform tasks. This improvement continued and was maintained during maintenance treatment of Privigen in the PATH study.\u00a0 Further results from the PATH study demonstrated that after switching from IVIG, the percentage of patients experiencing CIDP relapse or withdrawal for any other reason during SCIG treatment was significantly lower with Hizentra (38.6 percent on low-dose Hizentra [0.2 g\/kg weekly]; 32.8 percent on high-dose Hizentra [0.4 g\/kg weekly]; p values = 0.007 and <0.001 respectively) than with placebo (63.2 percent).\u00a0 In addition, approximately three times as many patients preferred subcutaneous treatment over intravenous treatment. CIDP is a chronically progressive rare autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nerves and may cause permanent nerve damage. The myelin sheath, or the protective covering of the nerves, is damaged, which may result in numbness or tingling, muscle weakness, fatigue and other symptoms which worsen over time.  \u201cCIDP treatment aims to achieve long-term remission and maintain motor and sensory function, with minimal adverse effects,\u201d said Prof. Satoshi Kuwabara, Department of Neurology, Chiba University.\u00a0 \u201cHowever, currently available treatment may not be sufficiently effective for some patients, and many CIDP patients continue to suffer disabling symptoms due to the disease and resulting lifestyle changes.\u00a0 We expect that novel treatment options, such as Hizentra that may be self-administered and Privigen that has been proven to have high evidence for its efficacy and safety in a large clinical trial, will improve long-term prognosis and quality of life of CIDP patients.\u201d\u00a0  The effects of CIDP lead to significant activity limitations and a decreased quality of life. Approximately 30 percent of CIDP patients will progress to wheelchair dependence if not treated.\u00a0\u00a0 Until now, the only immunoglobulin therapy available to treat CIDP in Japan was intravenously administered.\u00a0  William Mezzanotte, Executive Vice President, Research & Development, CSL Limited reinforced a commitment to the CIDP patient community saying, \u201cCSL Behring has dedicated years to studying CIDP to bring patients effective treatment options that fit their lifestyle.\u00a0 We are proud to offer Japanese patients with CIDP a balanced portfolio of immunoglobulin therapies with both Hizentra, a convenient option with proven efficacy and the flexibility and freedom to self-infuse, and Privigen, with its long-proven track record of safety.\u201d About CIDP In CIDP, a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nerves (those outside the brain and spinal cord), the myelin sheath, the protective covering of the nerves, is damaged. CIDP effects can worsen over time, leading to significant activity limitations and a decreased quality of life. CIDP can occur at any age but peak prevalence is between 40 and 60 years of age and is more common in men than in women. Approximately 30 percent of CIDP patients will progress to wheelchair dependence if not treated. It is estimated that the global prevalence for CIDP is 1.6 to 8.9 patients per 100,000 adults.  About Hizentra\u00ae Hizentra [Human normal immunoglobulin (SCIG)], the first 20 percent SCIG developed for subcutaneous use, is available in more than 45 countries to treat certain immune deficiencies and as a maintenance treatment for CIDP. Hizentra, the world's most prescribed SCIG, has a proven track record of safety, efficacy and tolerability and has over 6 million exposures worldwide since 2010.  About Privigen\u00ae Privigen [Human normal immunoglobulin (IVIG)] is a 10 percent, ready to use, liquid IVIG stabilized with proline. A naturally occurring amino acid, proline has been shown to reduce IgG aggregation and dimer formation. It is available in more than 60 countries around the world and is used as replacement therapy for patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, and as an immunomodulatory therapy for patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), Kawasaki disease, and neurological disorders such as CIDP, multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.

The poster \u2013 titled \u201cAcute Myocardial Infarction with Multi-Vessel Disease: Relationship with Service Utilization and Cost of Care\u201d was presented October 23rd at the 2018 American Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy Nexus. The study uncovered an unmet area of need for the sickest and most costly segment of patients and offers an important first step in identifying and adequately supporting these patients.\u00a0\u00a0  Clinical research shows that MVD occurs in about 60% of patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While there is no ICD-10-CM diagnosis code to accurately identify MVD, in approximately 50% of these cases, it is possible to infer MVD from the interventional procedures received.\u00a0 Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) patients with MVD are at increased risk for subsequent major cardiovascular events including stroke, recurrent MI, heart failure and death [1,2,3].\u00a0 This study demonstrated that patients treated for MVD had significantly higher healthcare services utilization and incurred substantially higher inpatient and outpatient\/emergency costs compared to AMI patients with occlusion of a single cardiac vessel.\u00a0 Inpatient hospital costs alone for MVD treated patients were almost $5,000 higher than for patients without MVD. \u201cThis groundbreaking retrospective data analysis helps us to better identify these highest risk MI patients, \u201csaid Dr. Ryan Saadi, Vice President of Global Access, Pricing, Health Economics & Outcomes Research (HE&OR) for CSL Behring.\u00a0 \u201cThis work further supports our promise to these patients and represents an important step in helping us to quantify the cost of care for MVD and ultimately helps us to develop better protocols and therapies for more effective outcomes.\u201d  Dr. C. Michael Gibson, Chairman of the PERFUSE Study Group at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Co-Author commented, \u201cThe results of this study have implications for patients, payers and healthcare systems.\u00a0 By defining the economic and clinical impact of MVD in this large patient population, we see an opportunity to meet a primary patient need while building a strong case for reconciling the difference between hospital costs and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) payments. Ultimately, new care pathways, protocols and therapeutic strategies will be necessary to manage the cost and resource utilization of MI patients with MVD.\u201d Existing diagnosis or procedure codes do not accurately identify the number of patients with MVD. Of the greater than 125,000 Medicare records analyzed for patients with a prior MI, only 27% with concomitant MVD were identified.\u00a0 Unfortunately, according to clinical research this represents only roughly half of the MVD patient population, and underscores the need for an explicit MVD ICD diagnosis code. Additionally, the creation of such a code would help to resolve differences in hospital costs and CMS payments, Though, MVD is a significant indicator of disease burden in MI patients, it has been underreported and poorly characterized in the literature, yet patients with MVD are sicker, are more likely to have had a prior MI, a higher incidence of lipid disorders, peripheral arterial disease, coronary heart disease, heart failure and shock. Additionally, they present substantial incremental burden to the healthcare system compared to patients with single vessel disease. Dr. Susan Gabriel, Director, Global Access, Pricing, HE&OR for CSL Behring noted, \u201cA significant research implication of this study is the precedent it has set for understanding and quantifying service utilization and costs when an existing ICD-10 code does not exist.\u00a0 The well designed process of applying appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria to Medicare FFS Standard Analytic Files enabled us to accurately evaluate and define treatment of a disease state even when the data were not readily available.\u00a0 We believe this sophisticated new model will make a significant contribution to future administrative claims research.\u201d The study investigators included Christopher Young, PhD; Susan Gabriel, MS, PhD; Gail Berman, MD; Charles Ruetsch, PhD; and C.

Important Safety Information IDELVION\u00ae, Coagulation Factor IX (Recombinant), Albumin Fusion Protein (rFIX-FP), is used to control and prevent bleeding episodes in people with hemophilia B. Your doctor might also give you IDELVION before surgical procedures. Used regularly as prophylaxis, IDELVION can reduce number of bleeding episodes. IDELVION is administered by intravenous injection into the bloodstream, and can be self-administered or administered by a caregiver. Do not inject IDELVION without training and approval from your healthcare provider or hemophilia treatment center.  Tell your healthcare provider of any medical condition you might have, including allergies and pregnancy, as well as all medications you are taking. Do not use IDELVION if you know you are allergic to any of its ingredients, including hamster proteins. Tell your doctor if you previously had an allergic reaction to any FIX product. Stop treatment and immediately contact your healthcare provider if you see signs of an allergic reaction, including a rash or hives, itching, tightness of chest or throat, difficulty breathing, lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, or a decrease in blood pressure. Your body can make antibodies, called inhibitors, against Factor IX, which could stop IDELVION from working properly. You might need to be tested for inhibitors from time to time. IDELVION might also increase the risk of abnormal blood clots in your body, especially if you have risk factors. Call your healthcare provider if you have chest pain, difficulty breathing, or leg tenderness or swelling. In clinical trials for IDELVION, headache was the only side effect occurring in more than 1% of patients (1.8%), but is not the only side effect possible. Tell your healthcare provider about any side effect that bothers you or does not go away, or if bleeding is not controlled with IDELVION.

Allen (neurologist, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis) on \u201cObjectives Measures You Should Use to Monitor CIDP and Treatment Response.\u201d\u00a0  About CIDP In CIDP, a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nerves (those outside the brain and spinal cord), the myelin sheath, the protective covering of the nerves, is damaged. This may result in numbness or tingling, muscle weakness, fatigue, and other symptoms. CIDP effects can worsen over time, leading to significant activity limitations and a decreased quality of life. CIDP can occur at any age and is more common in men than in women. Approximately 30 percent of CIDP patients will progress to wheelchair dependence if not treated. In the U.S., it is estimated that the incidence of CIDP is up to two patients per 100,000 people each year,[i] with a prevalence of 40,000 people affected.[ii]  About Hizentra\u00ae Hizentra (Immune Globulin Subcutaneous [Human] 20% Liquid), the first 20 percent immunoglobulin developed for subcutaneous use, is registered in over 51 countries and approved to treat certain immune deficiencies. Hizentra, the world's most prescribed subcutaneous immunoglobulin, has a proven track record of safety, efficacy, and tolerability and has over 6 million exposures worldwide since 2010.  \u00a0 Important Safety Information for the U.S. Hizentra\u00ae, Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human), 20% Liquid, is indicated for:  Treatment of primary immunodeficiency (PI) in adults and pediatric patients 2 years and older. Maintenance therapy in adults with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) to prevent relapse of neuromuscular disability and impairment.   Limitation of use: Maintenance therapy in CIDP has been systematically studied for 6 months and for a further 12 months in a follow-up study. Continued maintenance beyond these periods should be individualized based on patient response and need for continued therapy.  For subcutaneous infusion only.  WARNING: Thrombosis may occur with immune globulin products, including Hizentra. Risk factors may include: advanced age, prolonged immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous or arterial thrombosis, use of estrogens, indwelling vascular catheters, hyperviscosity, and cardiovascular risk factors. For patients at risk of thrombosis, administer Hizentra at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable. Ensure adequate hydration in patients before administration. Monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity.  Hizentra is contraindicated in patients with a history of anaphylactic or severe systemic reaction to human immune globulin (Ig) or components of Hizentra (eg, polysorbate 80), as well as in patients with immunoglobulin A deficiency with antibodies against IgA and a history of hypersensitivity. Because Hizentra contains L-proline as stabilizer, use in patients with hyperprolinemia is contraindicated. IgA-deficient patients with anti-IgA antibodies are at greater risk of severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. Thrombosis may occur following treatment with Ig products, including Hizentra. Monitor patients for aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS), which may occur following treatment with Ig products, including Hizentra. In patients at risk of acute renal failure, monitor renal function, including blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine and urine output. In addition, monitor patients for clinical signs of hemolysis or pulmonary adverse reactions (eg, transfusion-related acute lung injury [TRALI]). Hizentra is derived from human blood. The risk of transmission of infectious agents, including viruses and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent and its variant (vCJD), cannot be completely eliminated. The most common adverse reactions (observed in \u22655% of study subjects) were local infusion-site reactions, as well as headache, diarrhea, fatigue, back pain, nausea, extremity pain, cough, upper respiratory tract infection, rash, pruritus, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, migraine, arthralgia, pain, fall, and nasopharyngitis. The passive transfer of antibodies can interfere with response to live virus vaccines and lead to misinterpretation of serologic test results.  \u00a0 Full Hizentra prescribing information can be found at http:\/\/labeling.cslbehring.com\/PI\/US\/Hizentra\/EN\/Hizentra-Prescribing-Information.pdf.

Risk factors may include advanced age, prolonged immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous or arterial thrombosis, use of estrogens, indwelling vascular catheters, hyperviscosity, and cardiovascular risk factors. Renal dysfunction, acute renal failure, osmotic nephrosis, and death may occur with immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) products in predisposed patients. Renal dysfunction and acute renal failure occur more commonly in patients receiving IGIV products that contain sucrose. Privigen does not contain sucrose. For patients at risk of thrombosis, renal dysfunction or renal failure, administer Privigen at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable. Ensure adequate hydration in patients before administration. Monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity.  See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Privigen is contraindicated in patients with history of anaphylactic or severe systemic reaction to human immune globulin, in patients with hyperprolinemia, and in IgA-deficient patients with antibodies to IgA and a history of hypersensitivity. In patients at risk of developing acute renal failure, monitor urine output and renal function, including blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine. Hyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity, or hyponatremia can occur with Privigen. Infrequently, aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) may occur\u2014especially with high doses or rapid infusion. Hemolysis, either intravascular or due to enhanced red blood cell sequestration, may occur. Risk factors include non-O blood group and high doses. Closely monitor patients for hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. During and shortly following Privigen infusion, elevations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (including cases of hypertensive urgency) have been observed. These elevations resolved or significantly improved within hours with oral anti-hypertensive therapy or observation alone. Check patients for a history of hypertension and monitor blood pressure during this period. Consider relative risks and benefits before prescribing high-dose regimen for chronic ITP and CIDP in patients at increased risk of thrombosis, hemolysis, acute kidney injury or volume overload. Monitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions (transfusion-related acute lung injury [TRALI]). Privigen is derived from human plasma. The risk of transmission of infectious agents, including viruses and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent and its variant (vCJD), cannot be completely eliminated. In clinical studies of patients with PI, the most common adverse reactions to Privigen, observed in >5% of subjects, were headache, fatigue, nausea, chills, vomiting, back pain, pain, elevated body temperature, abdominal pain, diarrhea, cough, stomach discomfort, chest pain, joint swelling\/effusion, influenza-like illness, pharyngolaryngeal pain, urticaria, and dizziness. Serious adverse reactions were hypersensitivity, chills, fatigue, dizziness, and increased body temperature. In clinical studies of patients being treated for chronic ITP, the most common adverse reactions, seen in >5% of subjects, were laboratory findings consistent with hemolysis, headache, elevated body temperature, anemia, nausea, and vomiting. A serious adverse reaction was aseptic meningitis syndrome. In clinical studies of patients being treated for CIDP, the most common reactions, observed in >5% of subjects, were headache, asthenia, hypertension, nausea, pain in extremity, hemolysis, influenza-like illness, leukopenia, and rash. Serious adverse reactions were hemolysis, exacerbation of CIDP, acute rash, increased diastolic blood pressure, hypersensitivity, pulmonary embolism, respiratory failure, and migraine. Treatment with Privigen might interfere with a patient\u2019s response to live virus vaccines and could lead to misinterpretation of serologic testing. In patients over 65 and those at risk of renal insufficiency, do not exceed recommended dose and infuse at the minimum rate practicable.

IDELVION is the first and only FDA-approved factor IX therapy that delivers zero median AsBR (annualized spontaneous bleeding rate) and is approved for up to 14-day dosing in appropriate patients.\u00a0 When used prophylactically, IDELVION has been shown to elevate factor IX levels to 21% at steady state.  \u201cHaving a variety of vial sizes available for patients, particularly larger vials, increases convenience for patients in optimizing their administration regimen,\u201d said Craig Kessler, MD, Director, Division of Coagulation and Director of the Hemophilia and Thrombosis Comprehensive Care Center, Georgetown University Medical Center. \u201cThe 3500 IU vial can be helpful for patients currently on IDELVION or those who might have been waiting until more convenient vial sizes were available in order to begin treatment with IDELVION.\u201d  \u201cWe believe a good portion of the community will benefit from the addition of this fifth, larger vial to the IDELVION family,\u201d adds Jerry Powell, MD, Coagulation Medical Director, North America, CSL Behring.\u00a0 \u201cReconstituting the same amount of factor from a single vial will require less diluent than reconstituting multiple vial sizes, saving patients time and ancillary supplies.\u201d  In the clinical trial, IDELVION delivered high factor IX levels of 21% at steady state with prophylactic use and 5% over 14 days with one single dose.\u00a0 IDELVION is currently available in 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, and 2000 IU, with the 3500 IU vial to be available for order in the coming weeks.\u00a0  About Hemophilia B Hemophilia B is a congenital bleeding disorder characterized by deficient or defective factor IX; nearly all affected patients are male. People with hemophilia B may experience prolonged or spontaneous bleeding, especially into the muscles, joints, or internal organs. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the condition occurs in approximately one in 25,000 male births. About IDELVION\u00ae CSL Behring engineered\u00a0IDELVION\u00a0to extend the half-life of recombinant factor IX through fusion with recombinant albumin. CSL Behring selected recombinant albumin as its fusion partner for its coagulation factor proteins due to its long physiological half-life.\u00a0 IDELVION\u00a0is approved in\u00a0the United States, Australia, Canada the European Union and Japan.

Important Safety Information IDELVION\u00ae, Coagulation Factor IX (Recombinant), Albumin Fusion Protein (rFIX-FP), is indicated in children and adults with hemophilia B (congenital Factor IX deficiency) for:  On-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes Perioperative management of bleeding Routine prophylaxis to reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes  IDELVION is not indicated for induction of immune tolerance in patients with hemophilia B. IDELVION is contraindicated in patients who have had life-threatening hypersensitivity to the product or its components, including hamster proteins. IDELVION is for intravenous use only. IDELVION can be self-administered or administered by a caregiver with training and approval from a healthcare provider or hemophilia treatment center. Higher dose per kilogram body weight or more frequent dosing may be needed for pediatric patients. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible. Advise patients who self-administer to immediately report symptoms of hypersensitivity, including angioedema, chest tightness, hypotension, generalized urticaria, wheezing, and dyspnea. If symptoms occur, discontinue IDELVION and administer appropriate treatment. Development of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to IDELVION may occur. If expected Factor IX activity plasma levels are not attained or bleeding is not controlled with appropriate dose, perform an assay to measure Factor IX inhibitor concentration. Factor IX activity assay results may vary with the type of activated partial thromboplastin time reagent used. Thromboembolism (eg, pulmonary embolism, venous thrombosis, and arterial thrombosis) can occur when using Factor IX-containing products. In addition, nephrotic syndrome has been reported following immune tolerance induction in hemophilia B patients with Factor IX inhibitors and allergic reactions to Factor IX. The most common adverse reaction (incidence \u22651%) reported in clinical trials was headache. Please see full prescribing information for IDELVION.

Susan Fenters Lerch, executive director of the Hemophilia Foundation of Michigan (HFM), said her organization is using its LEAD grant to help counter what she describes as \u201cburgeoning threats to health care.\u201d HFM\u2019s strategy is to increase youth involvement, education and leadership in state-level advocacy to protect and enhance access to care. \"Advocacy is a necessary part of life for all members of the bleeding disorders community,\u201d Lerch said. \"In the words of one of our teen advocates, \u2018a bleeding disorder is part of my identity, and advocacy comes along with that.'\u201d In Washington State, people with hemophilia, von Willebrand disease and other rare bleeding disorders are dealing with increasingly complex public policies involving Medicaid, co-pays, out-of-pocket expenses and changes to the Affordable Care Act. The Bleeding Disorders Foundation of Washington (BDFW) is responding to these challenges by creating Advocacy 102 Summit Training for patients with its LEAD Grant.  BDFW is training up to 40 advocates to educate elected officials regarding health care issues. The foundation also hopes to place an advocate or advocates in a position to work on the pending federal effort to evolve the framework of the Washington State Bleeding Disorder Collaborative into a federal demonstration project. In Illinois, the Bleeding Disorders Alliance of Illinois (BDAI) supports nearly 3,000 patients affected by inherited bleeding disorders such as hemophilia and von Willebrand disease.\u00a0 With help from the LEAD grant program, BDAI is putting together an advocacy campaign designed to meet the current and future advocacy needs of the bleeding disorders community in the state.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The Gateway Hemophilia Foundation (GHF) in Missouri had previously developed a state-wide Advocacy Ambassador program that prepares patient-volunteers to serve as liaisons between GHF and elected officials, and to share their personal stories with decision makers.\u00a0 Now, with the help of a LEAD grant, GHF is building on its Advocacy Ambassador program by providing advanced advocacy training to strengthen relationships and increase engagement with key local legislators. Hemophilia of South Carolina (HSC) is tackling several major challenges.\u00a0 These involve establishing a standard of care for hemophilia and bleeding disorder patients in South Carolina, including access to Hemophilia Treatment Centers and Factor therapies as well as expanding its Advocacy Ambassador program.\u00a0 HSC\u2019s Advocacy Ambassadors are volunteers who help to establish and build a strong grassroots network of bleeding disorder advocates throughout the state, creating greater awareness of the needs of patients. HSC is also working to address continuity of care, primarily through better access to HTCs in South Carolina and to better secure access to healthcare and treatment for hemophilia patients through legislation or regulatory reforms.  \u201cCSL Behring is committed to supporting the important work of these organizations, which play a vital role in expanding patient access to information and healthcare,\u201d said Dennis Jackman, CSL Behring\u2019s Senior Vice President for Global Healthcare Policy and External Affairs.  \u00a0 \u201cThis is all the more important during a time of uncertainty around access to care for patients generally, and for those with rare and chronic medical disorders in particular,\u201d Jackman added. \u201cWe are driven by our promise to strive to ensure all patients have access to the medicines and services they need.\u201d  \u00a0 CSL Behring has awarded over $1 million in LEAD Grants since the program was established 10 years ago. The deadline for submitting proposals for the next LEAD Grant cycle is April 30, 2018.
