The trial achieved its primary endpoint of demonstrating non-inferiority in reducing HbA1c at week 26 with insulin icodec compared to insulin degludec. From an overall baseline HbA1c of 8.13%, once-weekly insulin icodec achieved a superior reduction in estimated HbA1c of 0.93% compared to 0.71% for insulin degludec (estimated treatment difference: -0.22%). In the trial, there was no statistical difference in estimated hypoglycaemia rates, and no severe hypoglycaemia events were observed for people treated with insulin icodec. The rates of severe or clinically significant hypoglycaemia (blood glucose below 3 mmol\/L) were 0.73 events per patient year exposed to once-weekly insulin icodec and 0.27 events per patient-year exposed to insulin degludec. In the trial, once-weekly insulin icodec appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. \u201cWe are very pleased with the results seen in ONWARDS 2, and once-weekly insulin icodec is the first insulin to demonstrate the ability to reduce the number of yearly basal insulin injections from 365 to 52 in a phase 3 trial\u201d, says Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. \u201cNovo Nordisk has for 100 years been committed to develop insulin treatment to improve glycaemic outcome and reduce the disease burden for people living with diabetes and we are excited to share additional results of the ONWARDS programme later this year.\u201d About the ONWARDS clinical programmeThe ONWARDS clinical development programme for once-weekly insulin icodec currently comprises six phase 3a global clinical trials, including a trial with real-world elements, involving more than 4,000 adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. ONWARDS 1 is a 78-week trial comparing the efficacy and safety of once-weekly insulin icodec with once-daily insulin glargine U100 both in combination with non-insulin anti-diabetic treatment in 984 insulin-na\u00efve people with type 2 diabetes. ONWARDS 3 is a 26-week trial comparing once-weekly insulin icodec with once-daily insulin degludec. The objective of the trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of insulin icodec in 588 insulin-na\u00efve people with type 2 diabetes. ONWARDS 4 is a 26-week trial comparing once-weekly insulin icodec with once-daily insulin degludec, both in combination with mealtime insulin. The objective of the trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of insulin icodec in 582 people with type 2 diabetes treated with basal and bolus insulin. ONWARDS 5 is a 52-week trial comparing once-weekly insulin icodec with once-daily basal insulin. The objective of the trial is to assess the effectiveness and safety of insulin icodec, with an app providing dosing recommendation, in 1085 insulin-na\u00efve people with type 2 diabetes in a clinical practice setting. ONWARDS 6 is a 52-week trial comparing once-weekly insulin icodec with once-daily insulin degludec, both in combination with mealtime insulin.

Ozempic\u00ae is now approved in the US at 0.5 mg,1.0 mg and 2.0 mg doses for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults. Further, Ozempic\u00ae is indicated to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke or death in adults with type 2 diabetes and known heart disease.

In the trial, people treated with semaglutide 2.0 mg achieved a statistically significant and superior reduction in HbA1c at week 40 compared to semaglutide 1.0 mg. In the trial, both doses of semaglutide appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal. Compared to semaglutide 1.0 mg, the gastrointestinal adverse events were similar for semaglutide 2.0 mg. \u201cWe are pleased with the FDA approval for a higher 2.0 mg dose of Ozempic\u00ae, which further supports our purpose of driving change in diabetes care\u201d said Martin Lange, executive vice president, Development at Novo Nordisk. \u201cThe approval of the 2.0 mg dose allows more people with type 2 diabetes to achieve and maintain individualised glycaemic targets and remain on the same medication for longer as their needs evolve.\u201d Novo Nordisk expects to launch Ozempic\u00ae 2.0 mg in the United States in the second quarter of 2022.

The acquisition of Dicerna\u2019s ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) platform is a strategic addition to Novo Nordisk\u2019s existing research technology platforms and supports the strategy of using a broad range of technology platforms applicable across all Novo Nordisk\u2019s therapeutic focus areas. Dicerna is a publicly held company focusing on RNAi-based therapeutics. Using its proprietary GalXC\u2122 and GalXC-Plus\u2122 RNAi technologies, Dicerna develops RNAi-based therapies to selectively silence genes that cause or contribute to disease. Dicerna\u2019s RNAi technology platform enables access to intracellular disease targets across hepatic and extrahepatic cell and tissue types. In 2019, Novo Nordisk entered a research collaboration with Dicerna to discover and develop RNAi therapies using Dicerna\u2019s proprietary GalXC\u2122 RNAi platform technology. The collaboration between Novo Nordisk and Dicerna encompassed the exploration of more than 30 liver cell targets with the potential to deliver multiple clinical candidates for disorders including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), type 2 diabetes, obesity and rare diseases. Novo Nordisk expects to initiate clinical development with the first target in 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, Novo Nordisk will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Dicerna common stock for USD 38.25 per share in cash for a total equity value of approximately USD 3.3 billion. The transaction will not impact Novo Nordisk\u2019s previously communicated operating profit outlook for 2021 or the ongoing share buyback programme. The transaction will mainly be debt financed.The acquisition will lead to an increase in research and development costs, with an estimated negative impact on operating profit growth in 2022 of around 3% due to higher operating costs and amortisations of intangible assets. \u201cThe acquisition of Dicerna accelerates Novo Nordisk\u2019s research within RNAi and expands the usage of the RNAi technology,\u201d said Marcus Schindler, PhD, professor, executive vice president and chief scientific officer of Novo Nordisk. \u201cWe build on our successful collaboration and by combining Dicerna\u2019s state-of-the-art RNAi drug engine and intracellular delivery with our deep capabilities in disease biology understanding and tissue targeting through peptides and proteins we have the potential to expand our pipeline and deliver life-changing precision medicines for people living with chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease and NASH as well as rare diseases like endocrine disorders and bleeding disorders\u201d. \u201cSince the start of our collaboration two years ago, the\u00a0Dicerna and\u00a0Novo Nordisk teams have established a strong rapport built on a foundation of mutual respect for one another\u2019s capabilities, culture and expertise,\u201d said Douglas Fambrough, PhD, founder, president and chief executive officer of\u00a0Dicerna. \u201cThe combination of\u00a0Dicerna\u2019s expertise in RNAi and oligonucleotide therapeutics and highly skilled employees with\u00a0Novo Nordisk\u2019s industry leadership in developing and commercialising medicines to treat serious chronic diseases, has the potential to significantly accelerate and expand our mission to deliver\u00a0GalXC\u00a0RNAi therapies for the benefit of patients and all our stakeholders\u201d. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, Novo Nordisk will initiate a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Dicerna. The closing of the tender offer will be subject to certain conditions, including the tender of shares representing a majority of Dicerna\u2019s outstanding shares, receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and other customary conditions. Upon the successful completion of the tender offer, Novo Nordisk\u2019s acquisition subsidiary will merge into Dicerna, and any shares of common stock of Dicerna not tendered into the offer will receive the same USD per share price payable in the tender offer. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021. Novo Nordisk is represented by Evercore as financial advisor and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP as legal advisor. About DicernaDicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: DRNA) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercialising medicines that are designed to leverage RNAi to silence selectively genes that cause or contribute to disease. Using the proprietary GalXC\u2122 and GalXC-Plus\u2122 RNAi technologies, Dicerna is committed to developing RNAi-based therapies with the potential to treat both rare and more prevalent diseases. In addition to the internal pipeline of core discovery and clinical candidates, Dicerna has established collaborative relationships with some of the world\u2019s leading pharmaceutical companies, including Novo Nordisk A\/S, Roche, Eli Lilly and Company, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Between Dicerna and the collaborative partners, the company currently has more than 20 active discovery, preclinical or clinical programmes focused on cardiometabolic, viral, chronic liver and complement-mediated diseases, as well as neurodegenerative diseases and pain. Dicerna is headquartered in Lexington, Massachusetts, and employs around 320 people. For more information, please visit www.dicerna.com About RNAi and the GalXC platform\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By silencing disease-causing genes, the GalXC platform has the potential to address conditions that are difficult to treat with other modalities like peptides, proteins or monoclonal antibodies. Instead of targeting proteins after they have been produced and released, RNAi silences the genes themselves via the specific degradation of the messenger RNA (mRNA) made from the gene. Rather than seeking to inhibit a protein, the RNAi approach can prevent a disease causingprotein\u2019s creation, directly impacting disease manifestation. Initially focused on disease-causing genes in the liver, Dicerna has continued to innovate and is exploring new applications of its RNAi technology with GalXC-Plus. GalXC-Plus expands the functionality of the platform to extrahepatic cell and tissue types, significantly expanding the platform\u2019s potential to treat diseases across multiple therapeutic areas with an origin outside of the liver.

Ozempic\u00ae is currently approved in the EU in 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg doses for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults. The positive opinion is based on the results from the SUSTAIN FORTE trial. In the trial, people treated with semaglutide 2.0 mg achieved a statistically significant and superior reduction in HbA1c at week 40 compared to semaglutide 1.0 mg. In the trial, both doses of semaglutide appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal. \u201cThe recommendation for the EU label extension of Ozempic\u00ae with the 2.0 mg dose is an important step towards offering additional options to people with type 2 diabetes who need treatment intensification to achieve their individualised glycaemic targets,\u201d said Martin Lange, executive vice president, Development at Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk expects a final approval by the European Commission within approximately two months, and Ozempic\u00ae 2.0 mg will be launched in the EU in the first half of 2022. The label expansion for semaglutide 2.0 mg is under regulatory review in the US. About the SUSTAIN clinical programme The SUSTAIN clinical development programme for once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide injection currently comprises 11 phase 3 global clinical trials, including a cardiovascular outcomes trial, involving more than 11,000 adults with type 2 diabetes.

About obesity Obesity is a chronic disease that requires long-term management. It is associated with many serious health complications and decreased life expectancy. Obesity-related complications are numerous and include type 2 diabetes, heart disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and certain types of cancer. The current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted that obesity also increases the risk of severe illness and hospitalisation due to COVID-19. The global increase in the prevalence of obesity is a public health issue that has severe cost implications to healthcare systems. Approximately 650 million adults are estimated to live with obesity worldwide and specifically 53% of the adults living in the EU are considered to be living with overweight. About Wegovy\u2122 (semaglutide 2.4 mg) and STEPSemaglutide 2.4 mg is an analogue of the human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) hormone. It induces weight loss by reducing hunger, increasing feeling of fullness and thereby helping people eat less and reduce their calorie intake. Once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg injection is approved for the treatment of adults with obesity or overweight in the US and UK, as an adjunct to diet and exercise. The approval is based on the results from the STEP (Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity) phase 3 clinical development programme. The global clinical phase 3a programme consists of four trials and enrolled approximately 4,500 adults with overweight or obesity.

PRX004 is a phase 2ready anti-amyloid immunotherapy designed to deplete the amyloid deposits that are associated with the disease pathology of ATTR amyloidosis. ATTR amyloidosis is a rare, progressive and fatal disease characterised by the abnormal build-up of amyloid deposits composed of misfolded transthyretin protein in organs and tissues, most commonly the heart and\/or nervous system. Prothena has completed a phase 1 study with PRX004 in patients with hereditary forms of ATTR, in which PRX004 was found to be safe and well tolerated. Novo Nordisk will initially focus on the clinical development of PRX004 in ATTR cardiomyopathy - an underdiagnosed and potentially fatal form of ATTR amyloidosis characterised by build-up of amyloid deposits in cardiac tissue. Under the terms of the definitive purchase agreement, Novo Nordisk acquires Prothena\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary and gains full worldwide rights to the intellectual property and related rights of Prothena\u2019s ATTR amyloidosis business and pipeline. Prothena is eligible to receive development and sales milestone payments totalling up to 1.2 billion US dollars including 100 million dollars in upfront and near-term clinical milestone payments. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is consistent with our commitment to create a better future for patients in critical need of new treatment options. We are confident that Novo Nordisk will leverage its extensive expertise in developing treatments for those affected by cardiovascular diseases to advance this promising potential treatment to patients on an expedited timeline,\u201d said Hideki Garren, MD, PhD, chief medical officer of Prothena. \u201cWith Novo Nordisk\u2019s commitment to further develop PRX004 in ATTR cardiomyopathy, Prothena will continue to focus on our mission to advance our robust portfolio designed to address rare peripheral amyloid and neurodegenerative diseases. We also wish to extend our sincere thanks and appreciation to all the patients and investigators who participated in the PRX004 phase 1 study.\u201d \u201cWith its innovative amyloid-depleting mechanism, PRX004 has the potential to offer a novel treatment option for ATTR cardiomyopathy \u2013 an often fatal disease with significant unmet medical need,\u201d said Marcus Schindler, chief scientific officer, EVP Research and Early Development at Novo Nordisk. \u201cThis acquisition is a testament to Prothena\u2019s pioneering work in ATTR amyloidosis and Novo Nordisk\u2019s dedication to advancing new disease-modifying therapies for the benefit of people with cardiovascular diseases which are the world\u2019s leading cause of death.\u201d About PRX004PRX004 is an investigational humanised monoclonal antibody designed to deplete amyloid associated with disease pathology that underlies hereditary and wild type ATTR amyloidosis (hATTR and wtATTR, respectively), without affecting the native, normal tetrameric form of the protein. It is generally accepted that at the time of diagnosis, affected organs in ATTR patients contain extracellular amyloid deposits that cause organ dysfunction. PRX004 has been shown in preclinical studies to promote clearance of insoluble amyloid fibrils through antibody-mediated phagocytosis and inhibit amyloid formation. This depleter mechanism of action has the potential to provide benefit for ATTR patients at high risk for early mortality due to amyloid deposition in vital organs. Prothena has completed a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter dose-escalation study (NCT03336580). 21 patients with hereditary ATTR Amyloidosis (hATTR) were enrolled to receive PRX004 intravenously once every 28 days for up to 3 infusions in the dose escalation phase of the study. Patients were enrolled into 1 of the following 6 PRX004 dose cohorts: 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg\/kg. Eligible patients who completed dose-escalation were provided the opportunity to enrol in the long-term extension (LTE) portion of the study. All 21 patients enrolled in the Phase 1 study successfully completed dose-escalation and 17 patients were subsequently enrolled in the LTE. PRX004 was found to be safe and well tolerated across all dose levels. About Prothena Prothena Corporation plc\u00a0is a late-stage clinical company with a robust pipeline of novel investigational therapeutics built on protein dysregulation expertise with the potential to change the course of devastating rare peripheral amyloid and neurodegenerative diseases.

Novo Nordisk intends to initiate a pivotal phase 3a programme with approximately 1,000 people with obesity or overweight with comorbidities. The global 68-week trial is planned for initiation in the second half of 2021 and will investigate the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide compared to placebo. \u201cThere is a significant unmet medical need within obesity treatment today. With oral semaglutide we aim to introduce a convenient and effective treatment option for people with obesity and healthcare providers enabling broader use of anti-obesity medication,\u201d said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president, Development at Novo Nordisk. \u201cAs a complement to our injectable anti-obesity medications, oral semaglutide has the potential to help more people living with obesity achieve weight loss goals and improve their health.\u201d About obesityObesity is a chronic disease that requires long-term management. It is associated with many serious health complications and decreased life expectancy. Obesity-related complications are numerous and include type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and certain types of cancer. The current COVID-19 pandemic has shown that obesity also increases the risk of severe illness and hospitalisation due to COVID-19. The global increase in the prevalence of obesity is a public health issue that has severe cost implications to healthcare systems. Approximately 650 million adults are estimated to live with obesity worldwide. About semaglutide 2.4 mg for weight management and STEPOnce-weekly sc semaglutide 2.4 mg is currently under regulatory review in the US and the EU as a treatment for adults with obesity. Semaglutide is an analogue of the human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) hormone. It induces weight loss by reducing hunger, increasing feeling of fullness and thereby helping people eat less and reduce their calorie intake. The submissions for regulatory review are based on the results from the STEP (Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity) phase 3 clinical development programme. The global clinical phase 3a programme consisted of four trials and enrolled approximately 4,500 adults with overweight or obesity. About oral semaglutideOral semaglutide (7 mg and 14 mg) is approved as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes in the US, EU and Japan under the trade name, Rybelsus\u00ae. The approval of Rybelsus\u00ae is based on the results from 10 clinical trials which included 9,543 adults with type 2 diabetes. Rybelsus\u00ae demonstrated a safe and well-tolerated profile across the clinical trials, with the most common adverse event being mild to moderate nausea which diminished over time.

The companies will conduct a phase 2b double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the safety and efficacy of Novo Nordisk\u2019s semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, and a fixed-dose combination of Gilead\u2019s investigational FXR agonist cilofexor and investigational ACC inhibitor firsocostat, alone and in combination in people with compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to NASH. The four-arm study in approximately 440 patients will evaluate the treatments\u2019 impact on liver fibrosis improvement and NASH resolution and will begin recruitment in the second half of 2021. This new phase 2b study builds on positive results from a phase 2a proof-of-concept study presented at the Liver Meeting Digital Experience\u2122 in November 2020 investigating semaglutide alone and in combination with cilofexor and\/or firsocostat in 108 people with NASH, and mild to moderate fibrosis. The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that all regimens were well tolerated over 24 weeks. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal. Across all groups, 5\u201314% of people discontinued any trial treatment due to adverse events. In addition, post-hoc analyses of exploratory efficacy endpoints assessing biomarkers of liver health at 24 weeks showed statistically significant improvements in hepatic steatosis (measured by magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction; MRI-PDFF) and liver injury (measured by serum alanine aminotransferase; ALT) in the combination treatment arms versus semaglutide alone.

Building on the positive results from our proof-of-concept trial, we hope together with Gilead to demonstrate the potential for semaglutide with cilofexor and firsocostat to help people living with NASH,\u201d said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president and head of Development at Novo Nordisk. \u201cGilead is pleased to expand our collaboration with Novo Nordisk and advance understanding of the potential for combination approaches in treating people living with cirrhosis due to NASH,\u201d said Mark Genovese, MD, senior vice president, Inflammation Clinical Development at Gilead Sciences. \u201cThis study is the latest example of our persistent focus on driving innovation to improve the lives of people living with liver diseases and fibrosis.\u201d Cilofexor and firsocostat are investigational compounds and are not approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) or any other regulatory authority. Their safety and efficacy have not been established. Semaglutide has not been approved by the FDA or any other regulatory authority for the treatment of patients living with NASH but has been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. About NASH NASH is a chronic and progressive liver disease characterised by fat accumulation and inflammation in the liver, which can lead to scarring, or fibrosis, that impairs liver function. The risk of progression to advanced liver disease, including liver decompensation (loss of liver function) and liver cancer, is higher in people with NASH than in the general population, and NASH could become the leading reason for liver transplants in most countries. Currently, no pharmacotherapy is globally approved for the treatment of NASH, and people with NASH are left with very few management options.

About Alzheimer\u2019s diseaseAlzheimer\u2019s disease represents a rapidly growing public health concern causing significant detrimental consequences to the affected people and their families and has led to substantial and increasing global socioeconomic impact. Worldwide, 70-100 million people are estimated to have early Alzheimer\u2019s disease (mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia stages). About data from preclinical models, real-world evidence studies and the post-hoc analysisAnimal studies highlight the key effects of GLP-1 relevant for Alzheimer\u2019s disease including improved memory function and reduced phospho-tau accumulation. Semaglutide has specifically been shown to reduce measures of neuro-inflammation which may affect cognition and function. Further, real-world evidence from two Danish nationwide registries, the US Truven claims database and the US FDA FAERS database support a potential association between lower risk of dementia following treatment with GLP-1. Finally, in a post-hoc analysis of data from three large cardiovascular outcomes trials conducted by Novo Nordisk (LEADER, SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6), which included 15,820 patients with type 2 diabetes with median follow-up of 3.6 years, a total number of 47 people were identified with development of dementia, of which 32 were on placebo and 15 on GLP-1 (liraglutide or semaglutide). The rate of developing dementia was statistically significantly reduced by 53% in favour of GLP-1. About oral semaglutideOral semaglutide (7 mg and 14 mg) is approved as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes in the US, EU and Japan. The approval of Rybelsus\u00ae is based on the results from 10 clinical trials which included 9,543 adults with type 2 diabetes. Rybelsus\u00ae demonstrated a safe and well-tolerated profile across the clinical trials, with the most common adverse event being mild to moderate nausea which diminished over time.

Further information Company announcement No 74 \/ 2020  Attachment","61":"Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark, 17 November 2020 - Novo Nordisk today announced headline results from the SUSTAIN FORTE trial, a phase 3b 40-week, efficacy and safety trial with once-weekly semaglutide 2.0 mg vs once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mg as add-on to metformin and\/or sulfonylureas in 961 people with type 2 diabetes in need for treatment intensification. The trial achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant and superior reduction in HbA1c at week 40 with semaglutide 2.0 mg compared to semaglutide 1.0 mg. When evaluating the effects of treatment taken as intended1 and from a high mean baseline HbA1c of 8.9%, people treated with semaglutide 2.0 mg achieved a statistically significant and superior reduction in HbA1c of 2.2% compared with a reduction of 1.9% with semaglutide 1.0 mg at week 40. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) treatment target of HbA1c below 7.0% was achieved by 68% of people treated with semaglutide 2.0 mg vs 58% on semaglutide 1.0 mg. From a mean baseline body weight of 99.3 kg, people treated with semaglutide 2.0 mg experienced a statistically significant1 and superior weight loss of 6.9 kg compared with 6.0 kg with semaglutide 1.0 mg. When applying the treatment policy estimand2, people treated with semaglutide 2.0 mg experienced a reduction in HbA1c of 2.1% compared to 1.9% for people treated with 1.0 mg dose at week 40. People treated with semaglutide 2.0 mg experienced a statistically non-significant weight loss of 6.4 kg compared with 5.6 kg with semaglutide 1.0 mg. *Statistically significant vs once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mg In the trial, both doses of semaglutide appeared safe and well-tolerated. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, the vast majority were mild to moderate and diminished over time and were consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class. Compared to semaglutide 1.0 mg, the gastrointestinal adverse events were similar for semaglutide 2.0 mg with nausea rates around 15% for both doses. The treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were similar and below 5% for both doses of semaglutide. \u201cWe are very pleased with the results from the SUSTAIN FORTE trial with the large HbA1c reduction from a high baseline as well as the safety and tolerability profile, which establish a attractive benefit-risk ratio for treatment of type 2 diabetes with semaglutide\u201d said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief scientific officer of Novo Nordisk. \u201cSemaglutide 1.0 mg has across the SUSTAIN programme demonstrated that up to 80% of patients achieved HbA1c levels below 7%. This study demonstrates that patients in poor glycaemic control increase the likelihood of achieving their HbA1c target when treated with semaglutide 2.0 mg.\u201d About the SUSTAIN clinical programme The SUSTAIN clinical development programme for once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide injection currently comprises 11 phase 3 global clinical trials, including a cardiovascular outcomes trial, involving more than 11,000 adults with type 2 diabetes in total.

The five-arm trial evaluated combinations of Novo Nordisk\u2019s semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, with Gilead\u2019s investigational FXR agonist cilofexor and\/or Gilead\u2019s investigational ACC inhibitor firsocostat over 24 weeks in 108 people with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The results were presented at The Liver Meeting Digital Experience (TLMdX), 13\u201316 November 2020 (Late Breaker #L02). The trial met its primary endpoint by demonstrating that in people with NASH and mild to moderate fibrosis all regimens were well tolerated. The most common adverse events (AEs) were gastrointestinal. Minimal pruritus (itching) was observed in people treated with cilofexor. Across all groups, 5\u201314% of people discontinued any trial treatment due to AEs. Exploratory efficacy endpoints assessing biomarkers of liver health at 24 weeks in post-hoc analyses showed statistically significant improvements in hepatic steatosis (measured by magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction; MRI-PDFF) and liver injury (measured by serum alanine aminotransferase; ALT) in the combination arms versus semaglutide alone. Although liver stiffness measured by vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) and enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) score declined in all groups, statistically significant differences between groups were not observed. \u201cThese results offer novel insights around the multiple mechanisms that drive NASH and demonstrate the potential of combination approaches for patients in significant need of a treatment option for this condition,\u201d said Naim Alkhouri, MD, director of the Fatty Liver Program, Chief of Transplant Hepatology, Arizona Liver Health, Chandler. \u201cWe are encouraged that these data showcase the potential for combination approaches to elicit improvements in liver fat content, liver biochemistry, and certain non-invasive tests of fibrosis, all of which have been associated with meaningful histologic improvement in NASH.\u201d \u201cGilead is focused on delivering scientific advances that can improve the lives of people with liver disease, both through our own innovation and in partnership with companies with complementary expertise, such as Novo Nordisk,\u201d said Mark Genovese, MD, Senior Vice President, Inflammation Clinical Development at Gilead Sciences. \u201cThese data offer new insights into potential therapeutic approaches to treating NASH, a disease which currently has limited treatment options.\u201d \u201cThis trial brings together Gilead and Novo Nordisk\u2019s respective expertise and science to provide important insights into potential new combination therapies involving semaglutide to help people living with NASH,\u201d said Martin Holst Lange, senior vice president, Global Development at Novo Nordisk. \u201cWe are now carefully evaluating next steps together based on a thorough assessment of data.\u201d The companies are also presenting preclinical data supporting the development of combination approaches in NASH. In the preclinical trial, semaglutide alone and in combination with cilofexor and\/or GS-834356 (an analogue of firsocostat) were administered daily for 12 weeks in a murine model of diet-induced NASH (n=15-16\/group). The results demonstrated that while semaglutide significantly improved NASH and fibrosis-related endpoints, the addition of either cilofexor or the firsocostat analogue further improved liver fat reduction. The combination of all three agents had the greatest impact on changes in the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS). The safety and efficacy of firsocostat, GS-834356 and cilofexor have not been established. Firsocostat, GS-834356 and cilofexor are investigational compounds and are not approved by the FDA or any other regulatory authority. Semaglutide has not been approved by the FDA or any other regulatory authority for the treatment of people living with NASH but has been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. About NASHNASH is a chronic and progressive liver disease characterised by fat accumulation and inflammation in the liver, which can lead to scarring, or fibrosis, that impairs liver function. The risk of progression to advanced liver disease, including liver decompensation (loss of liver function) and liver cancer, is higher in people with NASH than in the general population and NASH could become the leading reason for liver transplants in most countries. Currently, no pharmacotherapy is globally approved for the treatment of NASH, and people with NASH are left with very few management options.

Novo Nordisk will work with all existing and new suppliers to meet the target. The plan will be presented in connection with Climate Week NYC hosted this week in association with the United Nations and the City of New York. This commitment is the next step in Novo Nordisk\u2019s \u2018Circular for Zero\u2019 environmental strategy, which launched in April 2019 and set an ultimate ambition for the company to have zero environmental impact. The majority of Novo Nordisk\u2019s total carbon emissions originate in its supply chain, making this commitment with suppliers on renewable power integral to achieving Novo Nordisk\u2019s environmental strategy. In achieving this target, Novo Nordisk would therefore be eliminating at least 300,000 tons of greenhouse gases from its supply chain. Novo Nordisk has already committed to achieve zero CO2 emissions from the company\u2019s own global operations and transport by 2030 and, in 2020, achieved the target of using 100% renewable power across its global production. \u201cOur ambition of achieving zero environmental impact is a cornerstone of our aspiration to be a truly sustainable business,\u201d said CEO Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen. \u201cAchieving it requires that we look beyond our own organisation and collaborate across multiple sectors with suppliers to accelerate the transition to renewable power. We hope that others across the corporate sector will also benefit from these actions. I would like to pay tribute to the commitment of our suppliers, on whom this new ambition depends.\u201d To reach the target, Novo Nordisk will work alongside suppliers, sharing with them what it has learned on embedding renewable power through its operations. Suppliers\u2019 ability to meet the 100% renewable power target will be continually evaluated. SCHOTT, a producer of specialty glass and supplier of pharma packaging to Novo Nordisk, has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. Sourcing renewable power will be one pillar of their company strategy. SCHOTT CEO Dr Frank Heinricht said: \u201cOur transition to carbon neutrality is fuelled by close exchange and collaboration with valued customers. As one example, Novo Nordisk has shared valuable insights from their own experiences of sourcing renewable power. As part of our Zero Carbon strategy, we are taking action to reduce the environmental impact of our operations.\u201d Novo Nordisk hopes that by supporting its suppliers to use renewable power, it will also be contributing to a reduction in emissions more broadly, as other companies may benefit from their suppliers\u2019 shift to greater sustainability.

The approval of Rybelsus\u00ae in Japan is based on results from the PIONEER clinical trial programme, which involved more than 9,500 adults with type 2 diabetes, including approximately 1,300 adults from Japan. The approved label reflects the Japanese studies, which showed that Rybelsus\u00ae 7 mg once daily was comparable to liraglutide 0.9 mg once daily and, in combination with one other oral antidiabetic treatment, Rybelsus\u00ae 7 mg once daily was comparable to dulaglutide 0.75 mg once weekly, while Rybelsus\u00ae 14 mg once daily resulted in significantly greater reductions in HbA1c than both liraglutide and dulaglutide - the two most widely used injectable GLP-1 receptor agonists in Japan. \u201cWe are very excited about the approval of Rybelsus\u00ae in Japan, offering people living with type 2 diabetes the first and only oral GLP-1 in a tablet,\u201d said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief scientific officer. \u201cProviding people living with type 2 diabetes with efficacious and convenient treatment options is essential, as millions of people are currently not achieving target blood sugar levels on available oral antidiabetic medications.\u201d Novo Nordisk will now initiate reimbursement negotiations and expects to launch Rybelsus\u00ae in Japan thereafter.

AM833 phase 2 monotherapy trial The 26-week blinded phase 2 monotherapy trial with AM833 investigated safety, tolerability and efficacy for weight management in 706 people with obesity or overweight \u00a0with at least one weight-related comorbidity. The patients were randomised to treatment with five different weekly doses of AM833 (0.3 mg, 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg, 2.4 mg, 4.5 mg), liraglutide 3.0 mg or placebo. Approximately 100 people were included in each treatment arm. All treatments were administered in combination with lifestyle intervention therapy. The mean baseline body weight in the trial was 107.4 kg. The trial reached its primary endpoint by demonstrating a weight loss of 10.8% at week 26 with AM833 at the 4.5 mg dose, compared to a weight loss of 3.0 % with placebo1. The treatment difference was statistically significant. AM833 appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. AM833 and semaglutide phase 1 combination trial The 20-week multiple ascending dose phase 1 trial investigated safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and weight loss potential of AM833 administrated in combination with semaglutide 2.4 mg in 80 people with obesity or overweight. After 20 weeks of treatment, participants receiving the highest dose lost an average of 17.1% body weight from a mean baseline body weight of 95.1 kg (secondary end-point)1. The trial investigated the number of treatment-emergent adverse events (primary end-point) and AM833 was well-tolerated, with the most common adverse events being gastrointestinal disorders including nausea and vomiting, the majority being non-serious and mild or moderate in severity. The level of gastrointestinal disorders observed for the combination of AM833 and semaglutide in the trial was comparable to what is generally seen for glucagon-like peptides-1 (GLP-1) in monotherapy. \"We are encouraged by these impressive results and we look forward to further assessing the efficacy and safety of AM833,\u201d said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \u201cThe phase 1 and 2 data with AM833 for weight management, especially the combination with semaglutide, further strengthen Novo Nordisk\u2019s obesity pipeline and hold potential to close the gap between pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery\u201d said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen. About obesity and AM833 for weight management Obesity is a chronic disease that requires long-term management. It is associated with many serious health consequences and decreased life expectancy. Obesity-related complications are numerous and include type 2 diabetes, heart disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, chronic kidney disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cancer. AM833 is being investigated by Novo Nordisk for weight management in people with obesity and overweight with at least one weight-related comorbidity. AM833 is an acylated long-acting analogue of the human amylin hormone that induces weight loss by reducing energy intake. About sc semaglutide 2.4 mg for weight management Once-weekly sc semaglutide 2.4 mg is being investigated by Novo Nordisk as a treatment for adults with obesity. Semaglutide is an analogue of the human GLP-1 hormone. It induces weight loss by reducing hunger, increasing feelings of fullness and thereby helping people eat less and reduce their calorie intake.

STEP 2 (obesity and type 2 diabetes)STEP 2 is a 68-week randomised, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled trial. The trial compared the efficacy and safety of once-weekly sc semaglutide 2.4 mg after 68 weeks to placebo and once-weekly sc semaglutide 1.0 mg. Treatment was provided in conjunction with lifestyle intervention, in 1,210 adults with T2D and either obesity or overweight with comorbidities. The trial met both primary endpoints. In all people randomised1, a statistically significant greater weight loss of 9.6% was achieved at 68 weeks with sc semaglutide 2.4 mg, from a mean baseline bodyweight of 99.8 kg, compared to placebo (3.4% weight loss) and sc semaglutide 1.0 mg (7.0% weight loss). 68.8% of those who received sc semaglutide 2.4 mg achieved a weight loss of 5% or more after 68 weeks, compared to 28.5% with placebo. When evaluating the effects of treatment if taken as intended2, people treated with sc semaglutide 2.4 mg achieved a weight loss of 10.6%, compared to a 3.1% weight loss with placebo and 7.5% weight loss with semaglutide 1.0 mg at 68 weeks. 73.2% of those who stayed on sc semaglutide 2.4 mg for 68 weeks achieved a weight loss of 5% or more, compared to 27.6% with placebo.

The trial investigated the effect of once-weekly sc semaglutide 2.4 mg after 68 weeks compared to placebo in 611 adults with obesity or overweight with comorbidities. Both treatments were in conjunction with IBT, defined as weekly behavioural support, dietician counselling and reduced calorie diet. The trial met both of its primary endpoints. In all people randomised1, a statistically significantly greater weight loss of 16.0% was achieved with sc semaglutide 2.4 mg as an adjunct to IBT, from a mean baseline bodyweight of 105.8 kg, compared to a 5.7% weight loss with placebo plus IBT after the 68\u2011week treatment period. 86.6% of those treated with sc semaglutide 2.4 mg achieved a weight loss of 5% or more after 68 weeks as an adjunct to IBT, compared to 47.6% with placebo plus IBT. When evaluating the effects of treatment if taken as intended2, people treated with sc semaglutide 2.4 mg plus IBT achieved a weight loss of 17.6%, compared to a 5.0% weight loss with placebo plus IBT. 89.8% of those who received sc semaglutide 2.4 mg plus IBT achieved a weight loss of 5% or more after 68 weeks, compared to 50.0% with placebo plus IBT.

SOPHIA will provide evidence-based classification of predictors for obesity complications and response to obesity treatment while also identifying and charting models for sustainably developing treatment pathways that will be valuable for patients, healthcare systems, researchers and clinicians. \u201cOur mission within SOPHIA is to enable healthcare professionals to reliably predict the complications of obesity and who will respond to treatment,\u201d said Prof Carel le Roux, coordinator of SOPHIA and obesity physician at the Diabetes Complications Research Centre at University College Dublin. SOPHIA Project Leader Dr Marianne \u00d8lholm Larsen Gr\u00f8nning of Novo Nordisk, says: \u201cObesity is a complex, chronic disease and there is still a lot we do not know, both about the biology of the disease itself and how treatment can improve the lives of patients with obesity. SOPHIA is an important step towards understanding obesity better. The collaboration between excellent contributors from academia, industry and associations holds a big promise that we can deliver strong and unique results.\u201dThe voices of people living with obesity will be at the heart of SOPHIA through the establishment of a Patient Advisory Board. It will ensure that patients\u2019 insights, opinions and wishes are placed at the core of SOPHIA and interwoven into the multiple layers of the study. The research group will use its findings to contribute to a more patient-centric and equitable narrative around obesity and its multiple impacts on individuals from both a social and medical perspective. It all starts with obesity being a chronic disease, not something people choose to live with. SOPHIA has been granted \u20ac16 million in funding from the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) - a joint undertaking of the European Commission and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA); JDRF; the Obesity Action Coalition; and T1D Exchange. Some of the methods used in SOPHIA will be: SOPHIA will also investigate health outcomes in people with obesity who have type 1 diabetes.\u00a0According to Dr Sanjoy Dutta, JDRF Vice President of Research,\u00a0\u201cWith the statistical power afforded by such a large European collaboration, we will be able to investigate the two-way relationship between obesity and type 1 diabetes and ultimately be able to make valid predictions about health outcomes in this traditionally underappreciated population. Since recent epidemiological data indicate that nearly half of adults with T1D in some European countries have overweight or obesity, it is critical for the T1D community to address this challenge.\u201d The project will officially kick off its activities across Europe on 1 June 2020.\u00a0 It will last until 31 May 2025 and the first milestone is already planned for September 2020.

Copenhagen, Denmark, 27 May 2020 \u00ad\u2013 At a time of acute global health need, Novo Nordisk today announced the launch of a new social responsibility strategy: \u2018Defeat Diabetes\u2019. The strategy strengthens Novo Nordisk\u2019s commitment and introduces new long-term ambitions to provide access to affordable diabetes care to vulnerable patients in every country and to ensure that no child should die from type 1 diabetes. Today, one in every 11 people in the world has diabetes, a figure that is projected to rise to one in nine by 2045 if action is not taken. Diabetes places a great burden on health systems, and Novo Nordisk is committed to work with health authorities and other partners in the countries where it operates, to prevent and treat the disease. \u201cOur purpose to defeat diabetes is necessary now more than ever as diabetes continues to rise, and at a time when the world is suffering from the most devastating pandemic in recent times,\u201d said Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen, CEO of Novo Nordisk. \u201cIn addition to innovative medicine, we are committed to help societies defeat diabetes by accelerating prevention to halt the rise of the disease and providing access to affordable care to vulnerable patients in every country. Vulnerability has many faces, and diabetes hits the hardest in vulnerable communities. I am proud that we are stepping up our efforts and working in partnerships to tackle the diabetes crisis at a time of profound need.\u201d As a first step in our ambition to provide access to affordable insulin to vulnerable patients in every country, Novo Nordisk is reducing the ceiling price of human insulin from USD 4 to USD 3 per vial in 76 low- and middle-income countries, which are part of the company\u2019s existing Access to Insulin Commitment. This applies to Least Developed Countries as defined by the UN,\u00a0other low-income countries as defined by the World Bank\u00a0and middle-income countries where large low-income populations lack sufficient health coverage. To support the company\u2019s aspiration that no child should die from type 1 diabetes, Novo Nordisk is expanding its Changing Diabetes in Children programme to reach 100,000 children by 2030, up from 25,000. The programme provides care and life-saving medicine for children with type 1 diabetes in low-resource settings. Vice-President of the International Diabetes Federation and partner of the Changing Diabetes in Children initiative Dr Naby Balde states the urgency of action: \u201cDiabetes is rising in every part of the world and good health is not an equal opportunity. The lives of thousands of children living with type 1 diabetes in vulnerable communities have been saved by the Changing Diabetes in Children initiative. I welcome Novo Nordisk\u2019s efforts to vastly expand its reach and their broader efforts to defeat diabetes.\u201d As part of Defeat Diabetes, the company\u2019s Partnering for Change programme with the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Danish Red Cross, supporting care for people with serious chronic diseases in humanitarian crises, is also being extended. The partnership is supporting the integration of diabetes and hypertension care into the Red Cross\u2019s global health operations.

Med strategien styrker Novo Nordisk en r\u00e6kke initiativer for at forebygge og bek\u00e6mpe diabetes, og introducerer en ny, langsigtet ambition om at sikre adgang til diabetesbehandling, der er til at betale, for udsatte patienter i alle lande og en ambition om, at ingen b\u00f8rn skal d\u00f8 af type 1-diabetes. I dag har \u00e9n ud af 11 mennesker i verden diabetes, og det tal ventes at stige til \u00e9n ud af ni i 2045, hvis der ikke g\u00f8res noget. Diabetes er en betydelig \u00f8konomisk byrde for verdens sundhedssystemer, og Novo Nordisk forpligter sig til at arbejde sammen med sundhedsmyndigheder og andre partnere i de lande, hvor virksomheden driver forretning, for at forebygge og behandle sygdommen. \u201dVores m\u00e5l om at bek\u00e6mpe diabetes er vigtigere nu end nogensinde, fordi antallet af mennesker med diabetes bliver ved med at stige, samtidig med at verden er ramt af den mest \u00f8del\u00e6ggende pandemi i nyere tid,\u201d siger Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen, administrerende direkt\u00f8r for Novo Nordisk. \u201dDiabetes rammer h\u00e5rdt blandt udsatte befolkningsgrupper, og derfor vil vi s\u00f8rge for, at der altid er adgang til insulin, der er til at betale, for udsatte patienter, uanset hvor i verden de bor. Mens vi fortsat vil fokusere p\u00e5 at udvikle innovative l\u00e6gemidler, forpligter vi os med Defeat Diabetes ogs\u00e5 til at \u00f8ge den forebyggende indsats for at kn\u00e6kke den stigende diabeteskurve.\u201d Som et f\u00f8rste skridt i Novo Nordisks ambition om at skabe adgang til insulin, der er til at betale, for udsatte patienter i alle lande, s\u00e6nker vi prisloftet for human insulin fra 4 til 3 dollars per h\u00e6tteglas i 76 lav- og mellemindkomstlande, som indg\u00e5r i virksomhedens eksisterende Access to Insulin Commitment-program.

For at underst\u00f8tte virksomhedens ambition om, at ingen b\u00f8rn skal d\u00f8 af type 1-diabetes, udvider Novo Nordisk programmet Changing Diabetes in Children med m\u00e5let om at n\u00e5 ud til 100.000 b\u00f8rn i 2030 fra 25.000 b\u00f8rn i dag. Programmet stiller behandling og livsvigtig medicin til r\u00e5dighed for b\u00f8rn med type 1-diabetes i lavressourceomr\u00e5der. Dr. Naby Balde, vicepr\u00e6sident i International Diabetes Federation og partner i Changing Diabetes in Children-programmet, understreger vigtigheden af at handle nu: \u201dAntallet af mennesker med diabetes stiger overalt i verden, og der er ikke lige muligheder, n\u00e5r det g\u00e6lder sundhed. Tusinder af b\u00f8rn, der lever med type 1-diabetes i udsatte lokalsamfund, er blevet reddet af Changing Diabetes in Children-programmet.

STEP 4 is a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled, withdrawal trial exploring sustained weight management with semaglutide vs placebo. The 68-week trial investigated the effect of once-weekly subcutaneous (sc) semaglutide 2.4 mg on body weight in 902 people with obesity or overweight with comorbidities. After the 20-week run-in period, the 803 people reaching the target dose of semaglutide 2.4 mg had reduced their mean body weight from 107.2 kg to 96.1 kg and were randomised to continued treatment with either once-weekly sc semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo for 48 weeks. The trial achieved its primary objective by demonstrating that in all people randomised1, continued treatment with sc semaglutide 2.4 mg for 48 weeks (after the run-in period) resulted in an additional mean weight loss of 7.9%, from a mean baseline body weight at randomisation of 96.1 kg, whereas people on placebo regained 6.9% of the body weight. The treatment difference was statistically significant. People who received sc semaglutide 2.4 mg for 68 weeks (run-in period plus 48 weeks) achieved a total weight loss of 17.4%. When evaluating the effects of treatment if taken as intended2, people who continued treatment with sc semaglutide 2.4 mg achieved an additional mean weight loss of 8.8% whereas people on placebo regained 6.5%. The treatment difference was statistically significant. People who stayed on sc semaglutide 2.4 mg for 68 weeks achieved a weight loss of 18.2%. In the trial, sc semaglutide 2.4 mg appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. The most common adverse events among people treated with sc semaglutide 2.4 mg were gastrointestinal events. As seen previously with GLP-1 receptor agonists, most events were transient and mild or moderate in severity. \u201cAchieving sustained weight loss without medical therapy is known to be very challenging. STEP 4 shows that people continuing treatment with semaglutide achieved a further substantial weight loss while people switching to placebo, on the other hand, regained a significant amount of weight,\u201d said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk and continues, \u201cthis highlights that obesity is a chronic disease requiring sustained treatment, and we look forward to sharing additional results from the ongoing STEP programme\u201d. About obesity and sc semaglutide 2.4 mg for weight management Obesity is a chronic disease that requires long-term management. It is associated with many serious health consequences and decreased life expectancy. Obesity-related complications are numerous and include type 2 diabetes, heart disease,\u00a0obstructive sleep apnoea, chronic kidney disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cancer. Once-weekly sc semaglutide 2.4 mg is being investigated by Novo Nordisk as a treatment for adults with obesity. Semaglutide is an analogue of the human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) hormone. It induces weight loss by reducing hunger, increasing feelings of fullness and thereby helping people eat less and reduce their calorie intake. About the STEP clinical programmeSTEP (Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity) is a phase 3 clinical development programme with once-weekly sc semaglutide 2.4 mg in obesity. The global clinical phase 3a programme consists of 4 trials, having enrolled approximately 4,500 adults with overweight or obesity. STEP 1 \u2013 a 68-week safety and efficacy trial of sc semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo in 1,961 adults with obesity or overweight. STEP 2 \u2013 a 68-week safety and efficacy trial of sc semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo and once-weekly sc semaglutide 1.0 mg in 1,210 adults with type 2 diabetes and either obesity or overweight. STEP 3 - a 68-week safety and efficacy trial of sc semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo in combination with intensive behavioural treatment in 611 adults with obesity or overweight. STEP 4 \u2013 a 68-week safety and efficacy trial of sc semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo in 803 adults with obesity or overweight who have reached the target dose of 2.4 mg after a 20-week run-in.

The three clinical trials were investigating concizumab prophylaxis treatment in haemophilia A and B patients regardless of inhibitor status. Consequently, no additional patients will be recruited, and further treatment of patients currently enrolled in the trials with concizumab will cease.

TALs are easily engineered proteins that recognize specific DNA sequences. This protein fusion architecture allows the generation of extremely active and highly specific and compact nucleases that are compatible with all current viral and non-viral cell delivery methods. About haemophilia The incidence of haemophilia A is approximately one in 5,000 and of haemophilia B it is approximately one in 25,000 male births respectively1. Over 400,000 males have haemophilia A or B and the disease is severely underdiagnosed in developing countries2.An estimated 304,0003 people live with haemophilia A, which is a result of decreased or defective production of the blood clotting factor VIII. People with haemophilia B, of which there are some 136,0004, have deficiencies in producing clotting factor IX. For people with haemophilia, bleeds often occur in the joints, particularly knees and ankles. Bleeds can also occur in the muscles, soft tissues, gastrointestinal tract or even the brain. Trauma, major surgery, tooth extractions or other minor surgical interventions require medical supervision to manage the associated bleeding. Without treatment, bleeds are painful and can cause lasting damages and lead to impaired mobility. About bluebird bio, Inc. bluebird bio is pioneering gene therapy with purpose. From our Cambridge, Massachusetts headquarters, we\u2019re developing gene therapies for severe genetic diseases and cancer, with the goal that people facing potentially fatal conditions with limited treatment options can live their lives fully.

This collaboration, as one of many ways Novo Nordisk is partnering to improve care, will initially make solutions for behaviour change and education available to people with obesity in the US. \u201cWe are passionate about improving the lives of people with obesity and finding new solutions to support respectful and complete care, which includes lifestyle change and medical management,\u201d said Camilla Sylvest, Novo Nordisk executive vice president, Commercial Strategy & Corporate Affairs. \u201cWe believe that the combination of Noom\u2019s services, with Novo Nordisk\u2019s offerings to support people with obesity, will help educate and empower people with obesity to lose weight, keep it off \u2013 and live healthy lives.\u201d Noom's solutions seek to understand individual motivations and obstacles and use cutting-edge technology, including artificial intelligence, behavioural coaching by over 1,000 personal health coaches, data and wellness insights, to guide people towards sustainable change. \u201cSustainable change can\u2019t happen in a vacuum, and those living with obesity who want to manage their weight are in need of personalised human coaching to help them change their habits, so they can lose weight for good,\u201d said Saeju Jeong, CEO and co-founder of Noom. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked with the Novo Nordisk team for over a year and have engaged with over 4,000 people with obesity. We\u2019re enthused by the exciting feedback and know that by jointly testing and refining what works, we will continue to deliver much-needed, sustainable solutions and support, as part of a scientific, insight-driven treatment plan.\u201d About obesity Obesity is a complex, chronic disease that is influenced by multiple aspects, including physiological, psychological, genetic, environmental and socioeconomic factors.1 It is associated with many serious health consequences2 and decreased life expectancy.3 Obesity is not a life choice or simply a question about willpower4 and necessary help and support can be hard to find. There are few healthcare professionals trained in obesity care and patients often see their excess weight as something they should be able to solve on their own.5,6 Like any other chronic disease, the long-term management of obesity requires a full spectrum of treatment approaches, including lifestyle change and intervention, as well as pharmacotherapy or surgery.7 The global increase in the prevalence of obesity is a public health issue that has severe cost implications to healthcare systems.9,10 In 2016, 13% of adults, or approximately 650 million adults, were living with obesity worldwide.9 About Noom, Inc. Noom is the world's leading behaviour change company, disrupting the weight loss and healthcare industries. By combining the power of artificial intelligence, mobile tech, and psychology with the empathy of over 1,000 personal coaches, Noom helps people live healthier lives by changing their long-term habits. More than 50 million people have benefited from Noom\u2019s behaviour change courses, including its virtual diabetes prevention programme, which was the first of its kind to be recognised by the CDC. The Noom platform is already being used by leading healthcare and pharmaceutical companies to improve treatment outcomes for patients worldwide. The company is headquartered in New York City with offices in Seoul and Tokyo.

Attachment","101":"Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark, 20 September 2019 - Novo Nordisk today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Rybelsus\u00ae (semaglutide tablets), as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Rybelsus\u00ae, the brand name for oral semaglutide in the US, is the first approved glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist in a tablet. The approval of Rybelsus\u00ae is based on the results from 10 PIONEER clinical trials which included 9,543 adults with type 2 diabetes. Rybelsus\u00ae more effectively lowered blood sugar than sitagliptin and empagliflozin. Furthermore, treatment with Rybelsus\u00ae resulted in up to 4.4 kg reduction in body weight. Rybelsus\u00ae demonstrated a safe and well-tolerated profile across the PIONEER programme, with the most common adverse event being mild to moderate nausea which diminished over time. \u201cWe are very excited that we can make the first oral GLP-1 available in the US and thereby expand the treatment options for adults living with type 2 diabetes,\u201d said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \u201cNovo Nordisk has a very long legacy of developing innovative injectable medicines for people living with diabetes and, with the approval of Rybelsus\u00ae, we are now able to bring our innovation into the market for oral antidiabetics.\u201d Novo Nordisk plans to make Rybelsus\u00ae available to adults with type 2 diabetes in the US in the fourth quarter of 2019. Conference call On 23 September at 8 am CEST, corresponding to 2 am EDT, a conference call for investors will be held. Investors will be able to listen in via a link on the investor section of novonordisk.com. About Rybelsus\u00ae Rybelsus\u00ae (oral semaglutide) is an analogue of the naturally occurring hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Rybelsus\u00ae is the first and only GLP-1 receptor agonist (RA) in a tablet. It is administered once daily and is approved for use in two therapeutic dosages, 7 mg and 14 mg. Rybelsus\u00ae is currently under review by several regulatory agencies, including the European Medicines Agency and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency. Furthermore, Rybelsus\u00ae has been applied for a separate indication with the FDA for the reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease, with expected review completion by Q1 2020. Further information Company announcement No 54 \/ 2019  Attachment","102":" The new collaboration aims to develop solutions enabling dosing data from Novo Nordisk smart insulin pens to be shared with Medtronic Continuous Glucose Monitoring devices Dublin, Ireland and Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark, 16 September 2019 \u00ad\u2013 Medtronic plc and Novo Nordisk A\/S today announced a collaboration that will develop solutions to integrate insulin dosing data from future Novo Nordisk smart insulin pens into Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices from Medtronic, such as the Guardian\u2122 Connect system. People with diabetes spend an average of one hour a day on self-care, amounting to a full two years devoted exclusively to their disease over their lifetime.1,[2] This new, non-exclusive collaboration reflects both companies\u2032 commitment to making diabetes management easier by integrating key health technologies. \u201cMillions of people living with diabetes work to control their sugar levels and track their insulin injections every day. To help ease the hassle of diabetes management, we are excited to be partnering with Medtronic, the largest medical device company in the world,\u201d said Camilla Sylvest, executive vice president, Commercial Strategy & Corporate Affairs, Novo Nordisk. \u201cWe now collaborate with all major CGM device producers, which means we can bring the benefits of smart insulin pens to even more people.\u201d \u201cWe see incredible power in combining a variety of data points to drive insights that help people living with diabetes make more informed decisions around managing their glucose levels,\u201d said Alejandro Galindo, president of the Advanced Insulin Management division within the Diabetes Group at Medtronic. \u201cOur new agreement with Novo Nordisk, the world\u2019s largest producer of insulin, will streamline the sharing of two of the most important pieces of information \u2013 glucose measurements and insulin dosed. With this, Medtronic can further enhance our market-leading analytics and insights to help ease the burden of diabetes.\u201d By integrating glucose monitoring and insulin dosing data, people with diabetes and their healthcare professionals and caregivers (with permission from the person with diabetes) will be able to automatically track these two important items in a single place, giving people living with diabetes one less thing to think about in the daily management of their condition. Further, being able to view both glucose and insulin data together can facilitate more productive conversations between people and their doctors, enabling more informed decisions on how to better manage glucose levels and increase Time in Range (TIR) \u2013 the percentage of time people with diabetes spend in the optimal glycaemic range of 70\u2013180 mg\/dL.3 Novo Nordisk expects to launch its durable smart insulin pens, NovoPen\u00ae 6 and NovoPen Echo\u00ae Plus, as well as its disposable, pre-filled injection solution starting in 2020. Once available, smart insulin pens will be compatible with both Android and iOS devices. The Guardian Connect system will be updated as well to integrate data from these Novo Nordisk smart pens. Time in Range Time in Range refers to the percentage of time people with diabetes spend in the optimal glycaemic range of 70\u2013180 mg\/dL. The goal with diabetes management is to increase time spent in this target range and to minimise high and low sugar levels. Poor glycaemic control can lead to both immediate and long-term complications such as damage to blood vessels \u2013 increasing the risk of coronary artery disease and stroke. Damage to blood vessels can also lead to loss of vision, kidney disease and nerve damage. About the Guardian Connect system As the only CGM system with predictive alerts up to 60 minutes in advance, the Guardian\u2122 Connect system is a smart CGM system that helps people with diabetes stay ahead of high and low glucose events by empowering people using multiple daily injections (MDI) to more proactively manage their diabetes with meaningful, personalised insights. Healthcare providers may access this CGM data with their patient\u2019s permission to run robust reports that help them inform therapy decisions and improve engagement with patients.

The announcement follows a new investment in a 672-acre solar panel installation, roughly the size of 500 football fields, in North Carolina, US, which will provide power to Novo Nordisk's entire US operations from early 2020. Novo Nordisk is the first pharmaceutical company in RE100 to use only renewable electricity in production. RE100 is a collaborative, global initiative of businesses committed to using 100% renewable electricity. Novo Nordisk furthermore announced a new target of achieving zero CO2 emissions from all operations and transport by 2030. The goal is part of a new and ambitious 'Circular for Zero' environmental strategy with the ultimate aim of making Novo Nordisk a company that has zero environmental impact. The strategy will see Novo Nordisk take steps to minimise consumption and turn waste into resources, design and produce products so that they can be recovered and re-used and collaborate with suppliers to embed circularity in its supply chain. \"More than 29 million people use our medicines and from early next year, they can do so knowing that they're produced using only renewable electricity,\" said Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen, president and CEO. \"By committing to achieve zero emissions across our operations and transport by 2030 and by applying a circular mindset across our entire business, we are working towards a day when we will be able to say that Novo Nordisk is a company with zero environmental impact.\" In addition to the zero emissions target, the Circular for Zero strategy commits the company to a significant shift towards circular thinking within three focus areas: 1. Circular company:Novo Nordisk will continue to reduce the environmental footprint of its production by working towards the elimination of waste sent to landfill and zero loss of water, energy and resources. 2. Circular supply: Novo Nordisk will reduce environmental impact across its supply chain by collaborating with suppliers to encourage circular business practices and by increasing procurement of recycled and carbon-neutral materials and resources. 3. Circular products: Novo Nordisk will upgrade existing products and design new products based on circular principles and work towards a sustainable solution for the reuse and recycling of products. To help achieve its new ambitious target and to accelerate the adoption of circular thinking across the business, Novo Nordisk will partner with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which has a mission to accelerate the transition to a circular economy. Joe Murphy, CE100 Lead at Ellen MacArthur Foundation, said, \"We are happy that Novo Nordisk has become the first pharmaceutical company to join CE100, which is the world's leading circular economy network. Novo Nordisk brings a track record of delivering on their commitments, having already shifted to 100% renewable power within its production. With its 10-year ambition to implement circularity across the company, Novo Nordisk now belongs to a select group of leading organisations who are breaking new ground on the transition to a circular economy.\" Notes to editors Every year, Novo Nordisk uses large amounts of energy to manufacture and distribute vials and injection pens to people who need them. That puts the company on the frontline of some of today's biggest environmental challenges. In 2015, Novo Nordisk made a commitment with The Climate Group and CDP joining RE100, alongside 165 other global companies, to put reaching the ambitious goal of 100% renewable power in its production facilities by 2020 at the heart of its work. Today an agreement to run its new facility in North Carolina using 100% solar power means it is now on course to use only renewable electricity across its production plants. Novo Nordisk is the first pharmaceutical company in RE100 to have reached this goal. Novo Nordisk's production in Tianjin in China uses 100% windmill power. In Montes Claros in Brazil the company uses 100% water power, and in Europe all production sites use 100% windmill power. In Denmark all facilities - production and offices - run on 100% renewable power. Visit novonordisk.com for photos and information on Circular for Zero supporting this press release.

Strategien indeb\u00e6rer, at Novo Nordisk skal minimere forbruget; sikre, at affald bliver til nye ressourcer; designe og fremstille produkter, som kan genbruges; og samtidig samarbejde med leverand\u00f8rer om at indarbejde en cirkul\u00e6r tilgang i hele forsyningsk\u00e6den. \"Flere end 29 mio. mennesker overalt i verden bruger vores medicin, og fra starten af n\u00e6ste \u00e5r kan de g\u00f8re det med bevidstheden om, at den er fremstillet udelukkende ved hj\u00e6lp af gr\u00f8n str\u00f8m,\" siger Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen, administrerende direkt\u00f8r for Novo Nordisk. \"Ved at forpligte os til m\u00e5let om nul CO2-udledning fra al drift og transport senest i 2030, samtidig med at vi indarbejder den cirkul\u00e6re tankegang i hele virksomheden, arbejder vi os frem mod en dag, hvor vi kan sige, at Novo Nordisk er en virksomhed, der ingen p\u00e5virkning har p\u00e5 milj\u00f8et.\" Foruden m\u00e5let om nul CO2-udledning forpligter Circular for Zero-strategien Novo Nordisk til at indf\u00f8re en cirkul\u00e6r tankegang indenfor tre fokusomr\u00e5der: 1. Cirkul\u00e6r virksomhed:Novo Nordisk vil forts\u00e6tte med at reducere milj\u00f8aftrykket fra produktionen ved at arbejde hen imod eliminering af affald, der sendes til deponering, og nul spild af vand, energi og ressourcer. 2. Cirkul\u00e6re indk\u00f8b: Novo Nordisk vil reducere milj\u00f8p\u00e5virkningen i hele forsyningsk\u00e6den ved at samarbejde med leverand\u00f8rer om at tilskynde til cirkul\u00e6re forretningsprincipper og \u00f8ge indk\u00f8b af genanvendte og CO2-neutrale materialer og ressourcer. 3. Cirkul\u00e6re produkter: Novo Nordisk vil opgradere eksisterende produkter og designe nye produkter baseret p\u00e5 cirkul\u00e6re principper og arbejde hen imod en b\u00e6redygtig l\u00f8sning for genbrug og genanvendelse af produkter. For at hj\u00e6lpe med til at n\u00e5 det nye, ambiti\u00f8se m\u00e5l og f\u00e5 indf\u00f8rt den cirkul\u00e6re tankegang hurtigere i hele virksomheden vil Novo Nordisk samarbejde med Ellen MacArthur Foundation, som arbejder for at fremme omstillingen til en cirkul\u00e6r \u00f8konomi. \"Vi er glade for, at Novo Nordisk som den f\u00f8rste farmavirksomhed har tilsluttet sig CE100, som er verdens f\u00f8rende netv\u00e6rk af virksomheder, der \u00f8nsker at fremme dagsordenen om cirkul\u00e6r \u00f8konomi,\" siger Joe Murphy, CE100 Lead hos Ellen MacArthur Foundation. \"Novo Nordisk har en lang tradition for at opfylde deres m\u00e5ls\u00e6tninger og har allerede n\u00e5et m\u00e5let om omstilling til 100% gr\u00f8n str\u00f8m i produktionen. Med ambitionen om at indf\u00f8re cirkul\u00e6re principper overalt i virksomheden i l\u00f8bet af de n\u00e6ste 10 \u00e5r tilh\u00f8rer Novo Nordisk nu en eksklusiv gruppe af f\u00f8rende organisationer, der g\u00e5r forrest i omstillingen til en cirkul\u00e6r \u00f8konomi.\" Bem\u00e6rkninger til redaktionen Novo Nordisk bruger \u00e5rligt store m\u00e6ngder energi til fremstilling og distribution af h\u00e6tteglas og injektionspenne og k\u00e6mper derfor med en r\u00e6kke af tidens store milj\u00f8udfordringer. I 2015 tilsluttede Novo Nordisk sig sammen med 165 andre globale virksomheder RE100-initiativet, som ledes af The Climate Group og CDP, og forpligtede sig dermed til, at hele elforbruget i produktionen skal d\u00e6kkes af vedvarende energikilder senest i 2020. P\u00e5 baggrund af en ny aftale om at drive den nye fabrik i North Carolina ved hj\u00e6lp af 100% solenergi er Novo Nordisk i dag p\u00e5 vej til at n\u00e5 m\u00e5let om udelukkende at bruge gr\u00f8n str\u00f8m i den globale produktion. Novo Nordisk er den f\u00f8rste farmavirksomhed i RE100, der har n\u00e5et dette m\u00e5l. Novo Nordisks produktionsanl\u00e6g i Tianjin i Kina bruger 100% vindenergi. Fabrikken i Montes Claros i Brasilien bruger 100% vandenergi, og alle produktionsanl\u00e6g i Europa bruger100% vindenergi. I Danmark bruger alle driftsenheder - b\u00e5de produktion og kontorer - udelukkende str\u00f8m fra vedvarende energikilder.

Operating profit decreased by 4% in Danish kroner and increased by 3% in local currencies to DKK 47.2 billion, impacted by the depreciation of the US dollar and related currencies versus the Danish krone. Adjusting for severance costs related to lay-offs in second half of 2018 and the expense related to the priority review voucher for the filing of oral semaglutide, operating profit increased by 6% in local currencies. Net profit increased by 1% to DKK 38.6 billion and diluted earnings per share increased by 4% to DKK 15.93. In February 2018, Novo Nordisk launched Ozempic\u00ae, a new once-weekly GLP-1, in the USA. The weekly new-to-brand prescription market share for Ozempic\u00ae has now reached 26% and thereby stabilising the total Novo Nordisk GLP-1 market share. Ozempic\u00ae has now been launched in 11 countries in Europe and North America. In November 2018, Novo Nordisk completed the phase 3a PIONEER programme for oral semaglutide, a new once-daily GLP-1 tablet for people with type 2 diabetes, following successful completion of the remaining two trials, PIONEER 6 and 9. Novo Nordisk has decided to submit the oral semaglutide file around the end of first quarter 2019 and has notified the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that Novo Nordisk will request priority review of the oral semaglutide filing based on a priority review voucher. For 2019, sales growth is expected to be 2-5% measured in local currencies.

Under the collaboration agreement, Novo Nordisk will provide research and development (R&D) funding and support for Staten to develop its lead asset STT-5058 for treatment of dyslipidaemia. \"Novo Nordisk is joining forces with Staten Biotechnology at an exciting time for us, with the company's lead compound moving towards its first clinical trial, aiming to address the residual cardiovascular risk in patients with hypertriglyceridaemia,\" said Dr Hilde Steineger, CEO of Staten Biotechnology. \"This partnership provides the company not only with a knowledgeable development partner but also with a funding structure that allows founders, management and the founding investors to accelerate the development of the company\". \"Our partnership with Staten Biotechnology is a key step in executing our strategic priority to expand into cardiovascular diseases. Hypertriglyceridemia is a serious risk factor for cardiovascular disease, in particular often present in people with diabetes and obesity. Staten Biotechnology has developed STT-5058, a new promising concept validated by human genetics, for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. Combining Staten's know-how on STT-5058, the scientific excellence of the company's executive team and founders, with Novo Nordisk experience in drug development and commercialization, the project holds potential to make a real difference for people suffering from cardiovascular disease,\" said Marcus Schindler, Senior Vice President, Global Drug Discovery in Novo Nordisk. Under the exclusive option agreement, Novo Nordisk has the right to acquire Staten Biotechnology and gain worldwide rights to STT-5058. Staten Biotechnology and its shareholders will potentially receive signing and exercise fees, R&D funding, and milestone payments of up to 430 million euros. Staten Biotechnology develops novel and innovative strategies for the treatment of dyslipidemia, with a focus on hypertriglyceridemia treatment. With a unique approach towards neutralizing ApoC3, a key molecule in dyslipidaemia management, Staten Biotechnology is developing STT-5058, a humanized, monoclonal antibody, licensed from its co-development partner argenx (Euronext & Nasdaq: ARGX). This \"recycling\" antibody with extended half-life has the potential to lower triglyceride levels, and increase clearance of ApoC3-containing atherogenic particles.\u00a0 Multiple studies have identified ApoC3 levels to be inversely associated with a favourable lipid profile and insulin resistance, both key components in managing residual cardiovascular risk. BioGeneration Ventures (BGV) provided the company's seed financing in 2014 and Forbion led the Series A round in 2015, as the sole new investor. Staten is a prime example of Forbion's and BGV's company building activities, growing great scientific ideas into promising companies. https:\/\/www.statenbiotech.com\/ Novo Nordisk is a global healthcare company with 95 years of innovation and leadership in diabetes care.

This double-blinded trial investigated the cardiovascular safety of oral semaglutide 14 mg compared with placebo, both in addition to standard of care, in 3,183 adults with type 2 diabetes at high risk of cardiovascular events. The trial achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating non-inferiority of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) with oral semaglutide compared with placebo, both in addition to standard of care. The results are based on the accumulated occurrence of 137 major adverse cardiovascular events, with a median follow-up time of 16 months. The primary endpoint of the PIONEER 6 trial was defined as the MACE composite outcome of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke and showed a hazard ratio of 0.79 in favour of oral semaglutide compared with placebo. The 21% reduction in MACE in favour of oral semaglutide did not reach statistical significance. The MACE results demonstrated by oral semaglutide were driven by a statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular death of 51% (HR 0.49, p=0.03), while non-fatal myocardial infarction (HR 1.18, non-significant) or non-fatal stroke (HR 0.74, non-significant) were broadly similarly distributed between the two treatment arms. In addition, a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality of 49% (HR 0.51, p=0.008) in favour of oral semaglutide was observed. The improvements in secondary endpoints including HbA1c, body weight and blood pressure were similar to results reported throughout the PIONEER programme for oral semaglutide. Furthermore, the safety profile of oral semaglutide in PIONEER 6 was consistent with the established safety profile observed in previous PIONEER clinical trials. \"We are very encouraged that PIONEER 6 demonstrated cardiovascular safety as well as a significant reduction in both CV and all-cause mortality following oral semaglutide treatment in people with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"Based on the strong clinical data reported throughout the PIONEER clinical trial programme, we have now established a solid efficacy and safety profile for oral semaglutide and we are looking forward to sharing the results with regulatory authorities during 2019.\" Novo Nordisk expects to file oral semaglutide for regulatory review in the US and EU in the first half of 2019. As announced in August 2018, Novo Nordisk has since the approval of Ozempic\u00ae (once-weekly injectable semaglutide) engaged in a constructive dialogue with the US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) on minimising the need for additional separate large cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) to obtain a cardiovascular (CV) indication for semaglutide in different formulations Following the results of the PIONEER 6 trial, Novo Nordisk is now evaluating the potential to obtain a CV indication for Ozempic\u00ae based on the already obtained clinical data from the CVOT SUSTAIN 6 in combination with the CVOT PIONEER 6 with oral semaglutide. Novo Nordisk will continue these discussions with the FDA. PIONEER 6 was an event-driven, pre-approval cardiovascular outcomes trial for oral semaglutide. It was a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the cardiovascular safety of oral semaglutide vs placebo when added to standard of care in 3,183 people with type 2 diabetes at high risk of cardiovascular events. The PIONEER phase 3a clinical development programme for oral semaglutide is a global development programme with enrolment of 8,845 people with type 2 diabetes across 10 clinical trials, which have all been completed in 2018.

Resultaterne for forekomsten af alvorlige kardiovaskul\u00e6re h\u00e6ndelser for oral semaglutid var drevet af en statistisk signifikant reduktion i kardiovaskul\u00e6r d\u00f8d p\u00e5 51% (risikoratio 0,49, p=0,03), mens ikke-d\u00f8deligt myokardieinfarkt (risikoratio 1,18, ikke-signifikant) eller ikke-d\u00f8deligt slagtilf\u00e6lde (risikoratio 0,74, ikke-signifikant) var stort set ligeligt fordelt mellem de to behandlingsgrupper. Der blev endvidere observeret en statistisk signifikant reduktion i den samlede d\u00f8delighed p\u00e5 49% (risikoratio 0,51, p=0,008) i oral semaglutids fav\u00f8r. Forbedringerne for de sekund\u00e6re endepunkter, herunder langtidsblodsukker (HbA1c), v\u00e6gt og blodtryk, svarede til de resultater, der er rapporteret for oral semaglutid gennem hele PIONEER-programmet. Endvidere var sikkerhedsprofilen for oral semaglutid i PIONEER 6 konsistent med den sikkerhedsprofil, tidligere kliniske PIONEER-studier har fastsl\u00e5et. \"Vi er meget tilfredse med, at PIONEER 6 cementerer den kardiovaskul\u00e6re sikkerhed og samtidig viser, at b\u00e5de hjerte-kar-d\u00f8deligheden og den samlede d\u00f8delighed falder signifikant efter behandling med oral semaglutid hos mennesker med type 2-diabetes, som har h\u00f8j risiko for hjerte-kar-sygdom,\" siger Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, koncerndirekt\u00f8r for forskning og udvikling i Novo Nordisk. \"Baseret p\u00e5 de st\u00e6rke kliniske data, der er rapporteret hele vejen igennem PIONEER-programmet, har vi nu dokumenteret en solid effekt- og sikkerhedsprofil for oral semaglutid, og vi ser frem til at dele resultaterne med registreringsmyndighederne i 2019.\" Novo Nordisk forventer at indsende registreringsans\u00f8gning for oral semaglutid i USA og EU i f\u00f8rste halv\u00e5r af 2019. Som meddelt i august 2018 har Novo Nordisk siden godkendelsen af Ozempic\u00ae (semaglutid til injektion \u00e9n gang ugentligt) haft en konstruktiv dialog med de amerikanske sundhedsmyndigheder, FDA, om at minimere behovet for yderligere separate store kardiovaskul\u00e6re sikkerhedsstudier for at opn\u00e5 godkendelse af en kardiovaskul\u00e6r indikation for semaglutid i forskellige formuleringer. Efter resultaterne fra PIONEER 6 evaluerer Novo Nordisk nu muligheden for at opn\u00e5 en kardiovaskul\u00e6r indikation for Ozempic\u00ae baseret p\u00e5 de allerede foreliggende kliniske data fra det kardiovaskul\u00e6re sikkerhedsstudie SUSTAIN 6 i kombination med PIONEER 6 med oral semaglutid. Novo Nordisk vil forts\u00e6tte disse dr\u00f8ftelser med FDA. PIONEER 6 er et h\u00e6ndelsesdrevet kardiovaskul\u00e6rt sikkerhedsstudie med oral semaglutid gennemf\u00f8rt inden godkendelse.

Oral semaglutide is an investigational GLP-1 taken once daily as a tablet. PIONEER 9 was a phase 3a safety and efficacy trial investigating 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide compared with Victoza\u00ae and with placebo in 243 Japanese adults with type 2 diabetes. The trial successfully achieved its primary objective[1] by demonstrating that, from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.2%, people treated with 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide experienced statistically significant reductions in HbA1c of 1.1%, 1.5% and 1.7%, respectively, compared to a reduction of 0.1% with placebo after 26 weeks. Furthermore, 14 mg oral semaglutide achieved a statistically significantly greater reduction in HbA1c compared to a reduction of 1.4% with Victoza\u00ae. After 52 weeks, people treated with 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide experienced statistically significantly greater reductions in HbA1c of 0.9%, 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively, compared to an increase of 0.5% for people treated with placebo. Furthermore, people treated with Victoza\u00ae experienced a reduction in HbA1c of 1.1%, which was not statistically significant in favour of oral semaglutide. The Japan Diabetes Society (JDS) treatment target of HbA1c <7.0% was achieved by 50%, 67% and 80% of people treated with 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide, respectively, compared to 49% of people treated with Victoza\u00ae and 12% of people treated with placebo at week 52. From a mean baseline body weight of 71.1 kg, people treated with 14 mg oral semaglutide experienced a statistically significantly greater weight reduction of 2.8 kg after 52 weeks compared to 1.0 kg with placebo and a weight increase of 0.4 kg with Victoza\u00ae. People treated with 3 and 7 mg oral semaglutide experienced a body weight reduction of 0.0 kg and 0.6 kg, respectively. In this 52-week trial, oral semaglutide was well-tolerated and with a safety profile consistent with GLP-1-based therapy. The most common adverse events for oral semaglutide were constipation and mild to moderate nausea, which diminished over time. The proportion of people who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 2-4% for people treated with oral semaglutide. \"Achieving target blood glucose levels remains a challenge for many people living with type 2 diabetes,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"In PIONEER 9, an impressive 80% of Japanese people with type 2 diabetes treated with the highest dose of oral semaglutide achieved the Japan Diabetes Society target for good glycaemic control, with a safety profile consistent with injectable GLP-1 therapies.\" PIONEER 9 was a 52-week, randomised, double-blinded placebo-controlled and open-label active-controlled phase 3 safety and efficacy trial. It had 5 treatment arms comparing the dose-response, safety, and efficacy of 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide with placebo and with Victoza\u00ae 0.9 mg in Japanese people with type 2 diabetes, treated with diet and exercise alone or in addition to an oral anti-diabetic drug as monotherapy. PIONEER 9 randomised 243 people in a 1:1:1:1:1 manner to receive once-daily treatment with either a dose of oral semaglutide 3, 7 or 14 mg, Victoza\u00ae or placebo. The primary endpoint was the change in baseline HbA1c to week 26.

Oral semaglutid er en ny GLP-1 under udvikling, der tages \u00e9n gang dagligt som en tablet. PIONEER 9 var et fase 3a-sikkerheds- og effektstudie, der unders\u00f8gte 3, 7 og 14 mg oral semaglutid sammenlignet med Victoza\u00ae og med placebo i 243 voksne japanere med type 2-diabetes. Studiet opfyldte sit prim\u00e6re m\u00e5l[1], idet det viste, at i forhold til et gennemsnitligt baselineniveau for langtidsblodsukkeret (HbA1c) ved studiets begyndelse p\u00e5 8,2% opn\u00e5ede deltagere i behandling med 3, 7 og 14 mg oral semaglutid statistisk signifikante reduktioner i HbA1c p\u00e5 henholdsvis 1,1%, 1,5% og 1,7%, mod en reduktion p\u00e5 0,1% med placebo efter 26 uger. Endvidere medf\u00f8rte 14 mg oral semaglutid en statistisk signifikant st\u00f8rre reduktion i HbA1c, mod en reduktion p\u00e5 1,4% med Victoza\u00ae. Efter 52 uger oplevede deltagere i behandling med 3, 7 og 14 mg oral semaglutid statistisk signifikant st\u00f8rre reduktioner i HbA1c p\u00e5 henholdsvis 0,9%, 1,3% og 1,5%, mod en stigning p\u00e5 0,5% for deltagere i behandling med placebo. Endvidere oplevede deltagere i behandling med Victoza\u00ae en reduktion i HbA1c p\u00e5 1,1%, hvilket ikke var statistisk signifikant i oral semaglutids fav\u00f8r. Behandlingsm\u00e5let om HbA1c <7,0% som fastsat af den japanske diabetesorganisation Japan Diabetes Society (JDS) blev ved uge 52 n\u00e5et af 50%, 67% og 80% af deltagere i behandling med henholdsvis 3, 7 og 14 mg oral semaglutid, mod 49% af deltagere i behandling med Victoza\u00ae og 12% af deltagere, der fik placebo. I forhold til en gennemsnitsv\u00e6gt p\u00e5 71,1 kg ved studiets begyndelse opn\u00e5ede deltagere i behandling med 14 mg oral semaglutid et statistisk signifikant st\u00f8rre v\u00e6gttab p\u00e5 2,8 kg efter 52 uger, mod et v\u00e6gttab p\u00e5 1,0 kg med placebo og en v\u00e6gtstigning p\u00e5 0,4 kg med Victoza\u00ae. Deltagere i behandling med 3 og 7 mg oral semaglutid opn\u00e5ede v\u00e6gttab p\u00e5 henholdsvis 0,0 kg og 0,6 kg. Oral semaglutid var i dette 52-ugers studie veltolereret med en sikkerhedsprofil, der var konsistent med GLP-1-baseret behandling. De mest almindelige bivirkninger for oral semaglutid var forstoppelse og mild til moderat kvalme, som aftog med tiden. Andelen af deltagere, som afsluttede behandlingen f\u00f8r tid p\u00e5 grund af bivirkninger, var 2-4% for deltagere, som blev behandlet med oral semaglutid. \"Det er stadig en udfordring for mange med type 2-diabetes at n\u00e5 de anbefalede behandlingsm\u00e5l for blodsukkerniveauet,\" siger Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, koncerndirekt\u00f8r for forskning og udvikling i Novo Nordisk. \"I PIONEER 9 var det hele 80% af de japanere med type 2-diabetes, som blev behandlet med den h\u00f8jeste dosis oral semaglutid, der n\u00e5ede Japan Diabetes Societys behandlingsm\u00e5l for god blodsukkerregulering - med en sikkerhedsprofil, der er konsistent med GLP-1-behandlinger i injektionsform.\" Om PIONEER 9 og det kliniske udviklingsprogram PIONEER PIONEER 9 var et 52-ugers randomiseret, dobbeltblindet placebo-kontrolleret og ikke-blindet aktivt kontrolleret fase 3-sikkerheds- og effektstudie. Studiet havde fem behandlingsarme, som sammenlignede dosisrespons, sikkerhed og effekt for 3, 7 og 14 mg oral semaglutid med placebo og med Victoza\u00ae 0,9 mg i japanere med type 2-diabetes, som blev behandlet med di\u00e6t og motion alene eller som supplement til et diabetesl\u00e6gemiddel i tabletform som monoterapi.

The research platform of Embark Biotech, a recent spin-out from Center for Basic Metabolic Research at University of Copenhagen, builds on novel and unique insights into receptors that stimulate energy expenditure without triggering the sympathetic nervous system (the 'fight-or-flight' response). The aim of the collaboration is to develop novel drug candidates that help people with obesity lose weight by burning off excess energy instead of storing it as fat. The potential addition of energy expenditure drugs would make a meaningful difference in the treatment of obesity.\u00a0The work behind the research platform and the spin-out of Embark Biotech has been supported by Novo Seeds and the Novo Nordisk Foundation since 2016. \"The present project builds on the frontline insight into energy expenditure of the group of Zach Gerhart-Hines, who we recruited from the US to Center for Basic Metabolic Research just few years ago. Zach's group has fully exploited the special knowledge we have in cell surface receptor pharmacology to generate several innovative drug discovery projects, and we see the research collaboration with Novo Nordisk, a global leader within obesity care, as the optimal way of developing the technology to ultimately benefit the patients\", says Thue W. Schwartz, professor at Center for Basic Metabolic Research and co-founder of Embark. As part of the collaboration agreement, Embark will receive research support for activities conducted in the collaboration, and Novo Nordisk has an option to license exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialise products discovered in the collaboration. \"We are excited to get started on this project which aims at developing next- generation anti-obesity therapies\" says Marcus Schindler, senior vice president of Global Drug Discovery in Novo Nordisk. \"There is a huge unmet medical need for treatment of obesity. While more than 650 million people are currently living with obesity[1], it is rarely acknowledged, diagnosed or treated as a serious chronic and complex disease. We believe that Novo Nordisk and Embark together have both the capability and capacity to explore this new mechanism of action.\" Embark Biotech ApS is a spin-out platform biotech company from University of Copenhagen, dedicated to deciphering the therapeutic potential of energy expenditure. The academic founders include Professor Thue W Schwartz, Associate Professor Zach Gerhart-Hines, Postdoc Jakob Bondo Hansen and CEO, Casper Tind Hansen. The research platform\u00a0and\u00a0spin-out of Embark Biotech has been supported by exploratory pre-seed and pre-seed grants from Novo Seeds administered on behalf of the Novo Nordisk Foundation and by starting grants from the European Research Council (ERC) and the\u00a0Danish Council for Independent Research, as well as proof-of-concept grants from the European Research Council and the University of Copenhagen Tech Transfer Office.

Oral semaglutid er en ny GLP-1-analog under udvikling, der tages \u00e9n gang dagligt som en tablet. Studiet, som strakte sig over 52 uger, unders\u00f8gte effekten og sikkerheden af 3, 7\u00a0og 14 mg oral semaglutid sammenlignet med placebo hos 731\u00a0deltagere med type 2-diabetes, som blev behandlet med insulin og gennemsnitligt havde haft diabetes i 15 \u00e5r. I de f\u00f8rste 26 uger af behandlingsperioden m\u00e5tte den samlede daglige insulindosis ikke overstige niveauet ved studiets start (baseline), mens insulinbehandlingen i den efterf\u00f8lgende 26-ugers periode blev justeret uden restriktioner. Der blev i PIONEER 8 anvendt to forskellige statistiske metoder til at vurdere effekten af oral semaglutid: en prim\u00e6r statistisk metode[1], som kr\u00e6ves i henhold til nye regulatoriske retningslinjer, og som vurderer effekten uanset oph\u00f8r af behandlingen og brug af anden behandling; og en sekund\u00e6r statistisk metode[2], der beskriver effekten, mens behandlingen p\u00e5g\u00e5r og uden brug af anden behandling. Studiet opfyldte sit prim\u00e6re m\u00e5l vurderet efter den prim\u00e6re statistiske metode, idet det viste statistisk signifikante og st\u00f8rre reduktioner i langtidsblodsukker (HbA1c) og v\u00e6gt ved alle tre doseringer af oral semaglutid sammenlignet med placebo, alle givet som supplement til insulin, ved uge 26. Vurderet efter den sekund\u00e6re statistiske metode og ud fra et gennemsnitligt baselineniveau p\u00e5 8,2% opn\u00e5ede deltagere i behandling med 3, 7 og 14 mg oral semaglutid ved uge 26 reduktioner i HbA1c p\u00e5 henholdsvis 0,6%, 1,0% og 1,4% mod ingen reduktion (0,0%) hos deltagere, der fik placebo, alle givet som supplement til insulin, og henholdsvis 0,5%, 0,8% og 1,2% mod 0,0% ved uge 52. Behandlingsm\u00e5let om HbA1c p\u00e5 under 7,0% som fastsat af American Diabetes Association (ADA) blev ved uge 52 n\u00e5et af 36%, 47% og 64% af deltagere i behandling med henholdsvis 3, 7 og 14 mg oral semaglutid, mod 10% af deltagere, der fik placebo. I forhold til en gennemsnitsv\u00e6gt ved studiets begyndelse p\u00e5 85,9 kg opn\u00e5ede deltagere i behandling med 3, 7 og 14 mg oral semaglutid ved uge 52 endvidere et v\u00e6gttab p\u00e5 henholdsvis 1,0 kg, 2,9 kg og 4,3 kg mod en v\u00e6gtstigning p\u00e5 0,6 kg hos deltagere, der fik placebo, alle givet som supplement til insulin. Den gennemsnitlige samlede insulindosis ved baseline var 60, 62 og 54 enheder pr. dag for deltagere i behandling med henholdsvis 3, 7 og 14 mg oral semaglutid, mod 56 enheder pr. dag for deltagere, der fik placebo, og den samlede insulindosis var ved uge 52 steget med 2 enheder pr. dag, reduceret med 6 enheder pr. dag og reduceret med 7 enheder pr. dag for deltagere i behandling med henholdsvis 3, 7 og 14 mg oral semaglutid, mod en stigning p\u00e5 10 enheder pr. dag for deltagere, der fik placebo. I 52-ugers-studiet opn\u00e5ede deltagere i behandling med 3, 7 og 14 mg oral semaglutid f\u00e5 tilf\u00e6lde og sammenlignelige niveauer af hypoglyk\u00e6mi (alvorlig eller bekr\u00e6ftet ved blodsukkerm\u00e5ling) sammenlignet med placebo. Oral semaglutid var veltolereret med en profil, der var konsistent med GLP-1-baseret behandling. Den mest almindelige bivirkning for oral semaglutid var mild til moderat kvalme, som aftog med tiden. I PIONEER 8 var der 11-23% af de deltagere, der blev behandlet med oral semaglutid, som oplevede kvalme, mod 7% af deltagere, der fik placebo. Andelen af deltagere, som afsluttede behandlingen f\u00f8r tid p\u00e5 grund af bivirkninger, var 7-14% for deltagere, som blev behandlet med oral semaglutid, mod 3% for deltagere, der fik placebo. \"Mennesker med type 2-diabetes, som har behov for insulinbehandling, kan have sv\u00e6rt ved at opn\u00e5 en optimal blodsukkerregulering p\u00e5 grund af v\u00e6gtstigning og risiko for hypoglyk\u00e6mi,\" siger Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, koncerndirekt\u00f8r for forskning og udvikling i Novo Nordisk. \"I PIONEER 8 har vi set, at oral semaglutid er i stand til at forbedre blodsukkerreguleringen hos mennesker, som har haft diabetes i mange \u00e5r og i forvejen er i behandling med insulin - samtidig med yderligere fordele i form af klinisk betydningsfuldt v\u00e6gttab og uden \u00f8get risiko for hypoglyk\u00e6mi.\" PIONEER 8 var et 52-ugers randomiseret, dobbeltblindet, placebo-kontrolleret, multicenter-, multinationalt parallelgruppestudie med fire behandlingsgrupper. Studiet unders\u00f8gte effekt og sikkerhed af 3, 7 og 14\u00a0mg oral semaglutid sammenlignet med placebo hos mennesker med type 2-diabetes, som blev behandlet med basalinsulin alene eller alle kombinationer af basal\/bolusinsulin eller miksinsulin, herunder kombinationer af opl\u00f8selige insuliner. Insulinbehandlingen kunne kombineres med metformin. Den randomiserede 52-ugers behandlingsperiode blev delt i to: de f\u00f8rste 26 uger, hvor insulindosis blev begr\u00e6nset til niveauet f\u00f8r randomisering, efterfulgt af en 26-ugers-periode, hvor insulinbehandlingen blev justeret uden restriktioner. PIONEER 8 omfattede 731\u00a0deltagere, som gennemsnitligt havde haft diabetes i 15 \u00e5r. De blev randomiseret 1:1:1:1 til at modtage enten en dosis p\u00e5 3, 7 eller 14 mg oral semaglutid eller placebo som supplement til insulin. Det prim\u00e6re endepunkt og de bekr\u00e6ftende sekund\u00e6re endepunkter var \u00e6ndring i HbA1c og v\u00e6gt ved uge 26 i forhold til baseline. Vigtige sekund\u00e6re endepunkter var bl.a. \u00e6ndring i HbA1c og v\u00e6gt ved uge 52 i forhold til baseline. PIONEER, det kliniske fase 3a-program for oral semaglutid, er et globalt udviklingsprogram med en samlet deltagelse af 8.845 mennesker med type 2-diabetes i 10 kliniske studier, som alle forventes afsluttet i 2018.

Oral semaglutide is an investigational GLP-1 analogue taken once daily as a tablet. The 52-week trial investigated the efficacy and safety of 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide compared with placebo in 731 people with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin and an average duration of diabetes of 15 years. During the first 26-week treatment period, the total daily insulin dose was not allowed to be increased above baseline followed by a 26-week period where the insulin treatment was adjusted without restrictions. Two distinct statistical approaches to evaluating the effects of oral semaglutide were applied in the PIONEER 8 trial; a primary statistical approach[1] required by recent regulatory guidance evaluating the effect regardless of discontinuation of treatment and use of rescue medication, and a secondary statistical approach[2] describing the effect while on treatment and without use of rescue medication. When applying the primary statistical approach, the trial achieved its primary objective by demonstrating statistically significant and superior reductions in HbA1c and body weight with all three doses of oral semaglutide compared to placebo, all in addition to insulin, at week 26. When applying the secondary statistical approach, from a mean baseline of 8.2%, people treated with 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide achieved reductions in HbA1c of 0.6%, 1.0% and 1.4% respectively, compared to no reduction (0.0%) in people treated with placebo, all in addition to insulin, at week 26, and 0.5%, 0.8% and 1.2% respectively, compared with 0.0% at week 52. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) treatment target of HbA1c below 7.0% was achieved by 36%, 47% and 64% of people treated with 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide respectively, compared to 10% of people treated with placebo at week 52. In addition, from a mean baseline body weight of 85.9 kg, people treated with 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide experienced a weight loss of 1.0 kg, 2.9 kg and 4.3 kg, respectively, compared to a weight increase of 0.6 kg in people treated with placebo at week 52, all in addition to insulin. The mean total insulin dose at baseline was 60, 62 and 54 units\/day for people treated with 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide respectively, compared to 56 IU\/day for people treated with placebo, and the total insulin dose at week 52 was increased by 2 units\/day, reduced by 6 units\/day and reduced by 7 units\/day for people treated with 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide respectively, compared to an increase of 10 units\/day for people treated with placebo. In the 52-week trial, people treated with 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide experienced few and comparable levels of severe or blood glucose-confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes compared to placebo. Oral semaglutide was well-tolerated and with a profile consistent with GLP-1-based therapy. The most common adverse event for oral semaglutide was mild to moderate nausea, which diminished over time. In PIONEER 8, 11-23% of people treated with oral semaglutide experienced nausea, compared to 7% of people treated with placebo. The proportion of people who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 7-14% for people treated with oral semaglutide compared to 3% with placebo. \"For people with type 2 diabetes and requiring insulin treatment, it can be challenging to reach optimal blood sugar control levels due to weight gain and risk of hypoglycaemia,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"In PIONEER 8, oral semaglutide was able to improve blood sugar control for people with a long duration of diabetes and already treated with insulin, with the benefit of clinically meaningful weight reduction, and without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia.\" About PIONEER 8 and the PIONEER clinical trial programmePIONEER 8 was a 52-week, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, multinational trial with four arms comparing the efficacy and safety of 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide with placebo in people with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin alone or basal\/bolus insulin in any combination or premix insulin including combinations of soluble insulins. The insulin treatment could be combined with metformin. The 52-week randomised treatment period was split into two; an initial 26-week period during which the insulin dose was capped at pre-randomisation levels, followed by a 26-week period where insulin treatment was adjusted without any restrictions. PIONEER 8 randomised 731 people with an average of duration of diabetes of 15 years in a 1:1:1:1 manner to receive either a dose of oral semaglutide 3, 7 and 14 mg or placebo in addition to insulin. The primary endpoint and confirmatory secondary endpoints were change from baseline to week 26 in HbA1c and body weight. Key secondary endpoints included change in HbA1c and bodyweight from baseline to week 52. The PIONEER phase 3a clinical development programme for oral semaglutide is a global development programme with enrolment of 8,845 people with type 2 diabetes across 10 clinical trials, which are all expected to complete in 2018.

New data presented today at the 44th Annual Conference of the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) showed that the study population receiving Fiasp\u00ae achieved superior reductions in overall blood sugar levels (HbA1c), compared to the group on conventional insulin aspart, when both treatments were dosed at mealtime (estimated treatment difference (ETD) -0.17%). In addition, significantly lower overall post-meal blood sugar levels (1-hour after the meal) were achieved with Fiasp\u00ae compared to conventional insulin aspart1. \"Fiasp\u00ae has already helped to reduce challenges around mealtime blood sugar control for adults with diabetes, and it is exciting to see that similar benefits are achieved with children and adolescents in this trial,\" said Dr Bruce Bode, Diabetes Specialist with Atlanta Diabetes Associates in Atlanta, Georgia, and lead research of the study. \"These findings show that Fiasp\u00ae may offer a suitable option to improve blood sugar control and better meet the needs of this specific population.\" Another group of study participants, that injected Fiasp\u00ae 20 minutes after the start of the meal, achieved similar overall blood sugar levels to those taking conventional insulin aspart dosed at mealtime (non-significant ETD of 0.13% in favour of conventional insulin aspart). These results confirm the non-inferior profile of action of Fiasp\u00ae when dosed 20 minutes after the start of the meal, compared with conventional insulin aspart dosed at mealtime1. \"It can be hard for the parents and caregivers of children with type 1 diabetes to know exactly how much or how fast their children will eat, making the dosing of mealtime insulin challenging in relation to both timing and quantity,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"These results show that Fiasp\u00ae may be able to ease some of the burden of diabetes management at mealtimes for children and adolescents, as well as those who care for them. We hope to make this ultra-fast treatment option available to benefit this population as soon possible.\" There were no significant differences in the overall rate of severe or blood-sugar confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes, or overall rates of other adverse events such as nausea or injection site reactions, confirming the safety profile of Fiasp\u00ae in comparison to conventional insulin aspart1. The onset 7 trial (777 people randomised) was a 26-week, phase 3a, partially double-blinded, basal-bolus, treat-to-target trial, evaluating the efficacy and safety of Fiasp\u00ae compared with conventional insulin aspart in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. The study investigated Fiasp\u00ae dosed at mealtime (0-2 minutes before starting the meal) and 20 minutes after the start of the meal, in comparison to conventional insulin aspart dosed at mealtime (0-2 minutes before starting the meal). All treatment arms involved a multiple daily injection routine (basal-bolus) using Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) as the basal insulin. Fiasp\u00ae (fast-acting insulin aspart) is the only approved, new-generation, ultra-fast acting2-4 mealtime insulin injection. Fiasp\u00ae is insulin aspart in an innovative formulation, in which two excipients have been added: Vitamin B3 (niacinamide) to increase the speed of absorption and a naturally occurring amino acid (L-Arginine) for stability5. The result is a mealtime insulin that more closely mimics the natural physiological insulin response of a person without diabetes after a meal, compared with conventional insulin aspart5. Fiasp\u00ae (fast-acting insulin aspart) is approved in the US, Canada, Switzerland, Australia and the EU (including Norway & Iceland), along with a number of other markets. It is also currently under regulatory review in several other countries around the world. Fiasp\u00ae is currently indicated for the treatment of adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes only.

When public health strategies and individual care plans take into account the prevailing local cultures and associated conventions and behaviours, they are much more likely to be successful.\" Fuelled by rapidly increasing rates of obesity, diabetes could affect one in nine adults by 2045 - more than 730 million people.2 Within the same time frame, annual diabetes-related healthcare costs are expected to increase by 39% from 775 billion US dollars to more than 1 trillion dollars, further highlighting the urgency for action.4 Within their findings, researchers pointed to a number of social and cultural factors contributing to the rise of diabetes in cities around the world, including:1 A second study presented by Cities Changing Diabetes researchers at EASD 2018 demonstrated that rates of diabetes and obesity are accelerating in every region of the world today. North America and Europe, where obesity has been rising for decades, are expected to have the highest future type 2 diabetes prevalence but also the slowest future increases.5 Africa, on the other hand, is projected to see a near-threefold increase in the number of people living with diabetes as the population ages and obesity prevalence increases.5 Achieving a 25% reduction of obesity prevalence on the continent would result in 15.3 million fewer people with type 2 diabetes in 2045.5 \"Whether it's by initiating door-to-door care provision, relocating clinics within urban communities or through enabling peer support among religious faith groups, the many partners in the Cities Changing Diabetes programme are already acting to great effect on these research findings,\" said Niels Lund, vice president for Health Advocacy, Novo Nordisk. \"However, halting the rise of diabetes requires others to learn from their approach and to develop strategies that reflect local needs. To this end, the Cities Changing Diabetes programme is an open and inclusive partnership in which anyone with a stake in the prevention and treatment of diabetes is welcome to participate.\" The first study carried out Vulnerability Assessments in five highly diverse cities - Copenhagen, Houston, Mexico City, Shanghai and Tianjin - to assess the impact of cultural factors on vulnerability to type 2 diabetes. This included traditions and conventions, health beliefs and food practices, gender attitudes, and local practices to care seeking. Using semi-structured interviews, assessments were conducted with a total of 740 people.1 The second study investigated the regional prevalence of type 2 diabetes from 2017-2045, using past and target trend scenarios. The past trend scenario assumes that future increase in obesity prevalence is extrapolated linearly, and in a target scenario obesity prevalence is reduced by 25% in 2045. BMI data for all countries worldwide 2000-2014 were obtained from the Non-communicable Disease Risk Factor Collaboration, and the share of people in each age and BMI class were projected depending on scenario.5 Cities Changing Diabetes is a first-of-its-kind partnership programme with an ambitious global goal to reduce obesity by 25% so that only 1 in 10 people live with diabetes by 2045. More than 100 local partners - including city leaders and ministries, academia, diabetes associations, health insurers, community groups and business corporations - collaborate across disciplines and in new forms of public-private partnerships to map the diabetes problem, share solutions and drive actions to bend the curve on urban diabetes. The programme was initiated in 2014 by three global partners: University College London, Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen and Novo Nordisk. Today, 17 cities representing more than 130 million citizens are active partners: Beijing, Beirut, Buenos Aires, Copenhagen, Hangzhou, Houston, Jakarta, Johannesburg, Koriyama, Leicester, M\u00e9rida, Mexico City, Rome, Shanghai, Tianjin, Vancouver and Xiamen.

Lowering blood sugar to target levels is important to help prevent the complications of diabetes, but reductions can increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. In this post-hoc analysis, based on the reduction in hypoglycaemia risk with Tresiba\u00ae found in the maintenance period of the SWITCH trials, it is estimated that people with diabetes may achieve a mean HbA1c reduction of 0.70% (type 1 diabetes) and 0.96% (type 2 diabetes) with Tresiba\u00ae compared to insulin glargine U100 at similar rates of hypoglycaemia.1 \"Episodes of hypoglycaemia can be dangerous for people with diabetes and can often be a significant barrier to achieving glycaemic control,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"These findings add to already published evidence showing a reduced risk of hypoglycaemia with Tresiba\u00ae, providing further confidence that this treatment may help people with diabetes achieve blood sugar control.\" This post-hoc analysis is based on patient-level data from the SWITCH 1 and 2 trials. The SWITCH trials demonstrated statistically significantly lower rates of overall symptomatic hypoglycaemia versus insulin glargine U100 in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.2,3 About the new analysisThis post-hoc analysis investigated the individual patient-level risk of hypoglycaemia by HbA1c with Tresiba\u00ae and insulin glargine U100 to compare how glycaemic control differs at a similar rate of hypoglycaemia. For each trial participant at each visit their HbA1c level was linked with the number of hypoglycaemic events (blood glucose-confirmed [<3.1 mmol\/L] with symptoms or severe [third-party assistance]) since last visit. Reduction of hypoglycaemia risk with Tresiba\u00ae was calculated using the reduction in hypoglycaemia seen with Tresiba\u00ae compared to insulin glargine U100 in the SWITCH trials.1 About SWITCH 1 and 2SWITCH 1 and SWITCH 2 were two phase 3b, 64-week, double-blinded, randomised, treat-to-target, 2-period cross-over trials that investigated the hypoglycaemia profile of Tresiba\u00ae compared with insulin glargine U100 in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and at least one risk factor for hypoglycaemia, respectively. The trial design included a titration period in which the doses of study treatments (Tresiba\u00ae or insulin glargine U100) were gradually increased over a 16-week period, followed by a 16-week maintenance period during which a stable dose of study treatment was maintained.2,3 The primary endpoint was the number of severe or blood glucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes observed in participants during the maintenance period.2,3 About hypoglycaemia Hypoglycaemia occurs when blood sugar levels are too low and cannot provide the body's organs with the energy they need. Hypoglycaemia can cause a range of symptoms including confusion, trembling, sweating, increased heart rate, difficulty with concentration and speech.4,5 In severe cases it can lead to a seizure, coma or even death.4,6 About Tresiba\u00ae Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) is a once-daily basal insulin that provides a duration of action beyond 42 hours with a flat and stable glucose-lowering effect.7,8 Tresiba led to an effective reduction in HbA1c in clinical trials and showed a lower risk of hypoglycaemia in certain patient populations and studies compared to insulin glargine U100, in particular in type 2 diabetes.2,3,8,9 It also provides for a lower day-to-day variability in glucose lowering effect versus insulin glargine U100.8 Tresiba\u00ae received its first regulatory approval in September 2012 and has since been approved in more than 80 countries globally. It is commercially available in more than 61 countries.

Ryzodeg\u00ae is a combination of insulin degludec and insulin aspart (IDegAsp) in one pen for the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes. The results from the Step by Step trial were presented today at the 54th Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD 2018) in Berlin, Germany.1 \"Complicated treatment regimens that require multiple injections at different times of day can be difficult for patients to adhere to, potentially leading to poor blood sugar control,\" said Dr Athena Philis-Tsimikas, Step by Step lead investigator and corporate vice president, Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute. \"These trial results show that once-daily IDegAsp can offer people with type 2 diabetes a much simpler option with fewer injections compared with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart, to achieve effective blood sugar control.\" After 26 weeks, people in the once-daily Ryzodeg\u00ae treatment arm received 50% fewer injections and significantly fewer total daily insulin units (12%) compared with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart.1 Once-daily Ryzodeg\u00ae demonstrated a statistically significant 45% lower rate of nocturnal severe or blood glucose (BG)-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes compared with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart after 26 weeks. The rate of overall severe or BG-confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes was numerically lower for once-daily Ryzodeg\u00ae compared with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart.1 \"Hypoglycaemic episodes, especially at night, are often frightening for people with diabetes. Not only does once-daily Ryzodeg\u00ae offer a much simpler solution but it also significantly reduces the risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia compared with basal-bolus treatment,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"By reducing the number of daily injections, we hope that Ryzodeg\u00ae can help reduce the burden of diabetes, and make it easier for people with diabetes to comply with treatment and help them towards achieving better outcomes.\" The Step by Step trial compared the efficacy and safety of Ryzodeg\u00ae with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart in people with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin, with or without oral antidiabetic treatment in need of insulin intensification.1 The trial was a 38-week, international, open-label, randomised, treat-to-target trial involving 532 adults from seven countries.1,2 If participants were not on target at Week 26 or Week 32, they went on to receive an intensified insulin regimen, as would happen in real-life clinical practice.1 The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c after 26 weeks.1,2 Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in HbA1c after 38 weeks, responder rate (%) for HbA1c <7% after 26 and 38 weeks, and number of treatment-emergent severe or BG-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes during 26 and 38 weeks.1,2 Ryzodeg\u00ae is a combination of two distinct insulin analogues (insulin degludec and insulin aspart in the ratio of 70% and 30%), making it the first combination of a long-acting basal insulin and a mealtime insulin in one pen for people with type 1 and 2 diabetes.3-6 Ryzodeg\u00ae incorporates the benefits of the insulin degludec molecule.7,8 Ryzodeg\u00ae is given as an injection once or twice daily with main meal(s).4 Ryzodeg\u00ae offers a simpler regimen with fewer injections than basal and bolus therapy, in one pen.3 Ryzodeg\u00ae received its first regulatory approval in December 2012 and European Medicines Agency approval in January 2013. Since then, Ryzodeg\u00ae has been approved in more than 90 countries, including the US in September 2015. It is now commercially available in 20 countries.

The announcement follows the signing of a long-term lease on a good manufacturing practice (GMP) facility, previously operated by Asterias Biotherapeutics. The site will support Novo Nordisk's increased commitment to develop stem-cell based therapies within type 1 diabetes and other serious chronic diseases. Once operational in 2019, the facility will fulfil the supply of stem cell-based therapies for Novo Nordisk's clinical trial programmes. \"Our ambition is to develop stem cell-based therapies for a range of serious chronic diseases where we see significant unmet medical need,\" said Jacob Sten Petersen, corporate vice president and head of Stem Cell Research & Development (R&D), Novo Nordisk. \"The reliable, large-scale supply of therapies is a vital component in our efforts, so I am delighted that we have established this facility that further demonstrates our strong commitment to this field.\" In addition to the lease agreement, Novo Nordisk has secured a two-year non-exclusive licence on Asterias' intellectual property relating to stem cell manufacturing technology. To facilitate collaboration between the two parties and enable Asterias to progress its own clinical programmes, Novo Nordisk will sublease laboratory, manufacturing and office space within the facility back to Asterias until the end of 2021. The establishment of the production site follows Novo Nordisk's announcement in May of an agreement with the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) in which it licensed a technology to enable the generation of GMP compliant human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines in addition to the rights to develop these into future regenerative medicine therapies. Working in a GMP laboratory at UCSF, the partners are deriving cell lines that are defining a new quality standard in the production of stem cell-based therapies. Novo Nordisk's R&D in this field is anchored in its recently established Stem Cell Transformational Research Unit, based in M\u00e5l\u00f8v, Denmark. The unit oversees multiple partnership projects pursuing stem cell-based treatments for diabetes, Parkinson's disease, chronic heart failure and dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The new production facility will directly support these projects, enabling the future expansion of Novo Nordisk's stem cell research portfolio into the clinic. Stem cell-based therapy is emerging as a treatment option for a number of serious chronic diseases. It has the potential to provide novel treatments for diseases with high unmet medical needs where no or inadequate therapy exists. Pluripotent stem cells have an unlimited capacity for self-renewal and the potential to be differentiated into any specialised cell type in the body. The Novo Nordisk stem cell technology platform is based on human embryonic stem cells (hESC) that can be used for generation of cell products for a wide range of therapeutic indications.

Det sker efter underskrivelsen af et langtidslejem\u00e5l p\u00e5 en fabrik, som tidligere blev drevet af Asterias Biotherapeutics. Fabrikken er GMP-godkendt og lever op til de g\u00e6ldende standarder for god fremstillingspraksis. Det nye anl\u00e6g skal underst\u00f8tte Novo Nordisks \u00f8gede engagement i udvikling af stamcellebaserede behandlinger til type 1-diabetes og andre alvorlige kroniske sygdomme. Fabrikken vil, n\u00e5r den st\u00e5r klar i 2019, levere stamcellebaserede behandlinger til Novo Nordisks kliniske fors\u00f8gsprogrammer. \"Det er vores ambition at udvikle stamcellebaserede behandlinger til en r\u00e6kke alvorlige kroniske sygdomme, hvor vi ser et betydeligt ud\u00e6kket medicinsk behov,\" siger Jacob Sten Petersen, funktionschef og leder af Stem Cell Research & Development i Novo Nordisk. \"I den sammenh\u00e6ng er det afg\u00f8rende, at vi kan sikre en p\u00e5lidelig produktion af behandlinger i stor skala, s\u00e5 jeg er meget glad for, at vi har etableret denne fabrik, som tydeligt understreger vores store engagement p\u00e5 dette omr\u00e5de.\" Foruden lejeaftalen har Novo Nordisk f\u00e5et en to\u00e5rig ikke-eksklusiv licens p\u00e5 Asterias' immaterielle rettigheder relateret til teknologien bag stamcelleproduktion. For at fremme samarbejdet mellem de to parter og g\u00f8re det muligt for Asterias at arbejde videre med egne kliniske programmer vil Novo Nordisk tilbageleje laboratorie-, produktions- og kontorlokaler p\u00e5 fabriksomr\u00e5det til Asterias indtil slutningen af 2021. Etableringen af produktionsanl\u00e6gget sker i forl\u00e6ngelse af en aftale, som Novo Nordisk indgik i maj med University of California San Francisco (UCSF). Denne aftale indebar, at Novo Nordisk fik licens p\u00e5 en teknologi, der skal g\u00f8re det muligt af fremstille humane embryonale stamcellelinjer (hESC) i overensstemmelse med god fremstillingspraksis, foruden rettighederne til at udvikle disse cellelinjer til fremtidige regenerative medicinske behandlinger. Cellelinjerne udvindes af partnerne i et GMP-laboratorium p\u00e5 UCSF og vil s\u00e6tte en ny kvalitetsstandard indenfor fremstilling af stamcellebaserede behandlinger. Novo Nordisks forskning og udvikling indenfor dette omr\u00e5de er forankret i det nyetablerede Stem Cell Transformational Research Unit, som er placeret i M\u00e5l\u00f8v i Danmark. Enheden st\u00e5r for flere forskellige partnerskabsprojekter, der fokuserer p\u00e5 stamcellebaserede behandlinger for diabetes, Parkinsons sygdom, kronisk hjertesvigt og \u00f8jensygdommen t\u00f8r aldersrelateret makuladegeneration (AMD). Den nye fabrik vil direkte st\u00f8tte disse projekter og muligg\u00f8re en fremtidig udbredelse af Novo Nordisks portef\u00f8lje indenfor stamcelleforskning til klinikken. Stamcellebaseret behandling er i stigende grad i fokus til behandling af en r\u00e6kke alvorlige kroniske sygdomme. Det har potentiale til at blive banebrydende for behandlingen af sygdomme med et stort ud\u00e6kket medicinsk behov, hvor der ikke findes behandling, eller hvor behandlingen er mangelfuld. Pluripotente stamceller har ubegr\u00e6nset evne til selvfornyelse og potentiale til at differentiere sig til en hvilken som helst specialiseret celletype i kroppen. Novo Nordisks stamcelleteknologiplatform er baseret p\u00e5 humane embryonale stamceller, der kan anvendes til at frembringe celleprodukter til en lang r\u00e6kke terapeutiske indikationer.

NovoPen\u00ae 6 og NovoPen Echo\u00ae Plus skal p\u00e5 l\u00e6ngere sigt gradvist erstatte NovoPen\u00ae 5 og NovoPen Echo\u00ae i de lande, hvor disse pensystemer markedsf\u00f8res i dag. \"Efter tilbagemeldingerne fra behandlerne vidste vi, at en global lancering ville v\u00e6re det rigtige,\" siger Camilla Sylvest. Hun refererer til en svensk pilotlancering i 2017-18 i samarbejde med Glooko. \"Under afpr\u00f8vningen noterede sundhedsudbyderne, at dialogen med patienterne blev bedre, uden at det var n\u00f8dvendigt at investere mere tid.\" Marcel Gmuender, som er globalt ansvarlig for Roche Diabetes Care, tilf\u00f8jer: \"Synkronisering af Novo Nordisks insulindata med vores digitale diabetesbehandlingsl\u00f8sninger som mySugr og Accu-Chek Smart Pix vil \u00f8ge behandlingskvaliteten og hj\u00e6lpe med til at skabe mere b\u00e6redygtige sundhedssystemer.\" Novo Nordisk vil i de kommende \u00e5r ogs\u00e5 integrere insulindoseringsdata med data fra Dexcoms systemer til kontinuerlig blodsukkermonitorering. \"Vi tror, at et fuldt integreret \u00f8kosystem repr\u00e6senterer en v\u00e6sentlig mulighed for at forbedre livskvaliteten for mennesker, der tager flere daglige injektioner,\" siger Steve Pacelli, direkt\u00f8r for Strategy & Corporate Development i Dexcom. \"Vi er glade for at udvide vores samarbejde med Novo Nordisk,\" siger Russ Johannesson, administrerende direkt\u00f8r for Glooko. \"Vi er sp\u00e6ndte p\u00e5 at udvikle vores integrerede l\u00f8sninger og ser frem til at hj\u00e6lpe flere mennesker med at regulere deres diabetes via Glooko-platformen.\" Novo Nordisk forventer efter lanceringen af de intelligente flergangsinsulinpenne at levere intelligente l\u00f8sninger for pr\u00e6fyldte engangsinjektionspenne senere i 2019.

The global survey investigated cardiovascular disease (CVD) awareness among 12,695 people with type 2 diabetes and revealed that 2 in 3 had CVD risk factors such as high blood pressure, uncontrolled blood glucose levels and high cholesterol and\/or had experienced a CVD event such as angina, heart attack, stroke or heart failure. However, 1 in 4 respondents had never discussed, or cannot remember discussing, CVD risk factors with a doctor and only 1 in 4 considered themselves to be at low risk of CVD.2 Commenting on the findings, IDF President Professor Nam H. Cho said: \"These survey findings confirm our concerns about the increasing global prevalence of diabetes and its associated complications. Awareness of the risks and consequences of the disease remains pitifully low and education to address diabetes complications is lacking. We urge governments to invest in measures to detect type 2 diabetes early and ensure that health professionals are trained to guide people to make positive changes to their lifestyle and better manage their diabetes. This will help people to avoid disabling and life-threating diabetes complications.\" Diabetes currently affects 425 million adults worldwide,3 with most cases being type 2 diabetes. CVD, which includes stroke, coronary heart disease and peripheral artery disease,4 is the leading cause of disability and death in people with type 2 diabetes.1 In the Taking Diabetes to Heart survey, 3 in 4 people with type 2 diabetes said they relied on information about CVD from their doctor. More than half of respondents said they needed more information about the risk factors associated with the development of CVD to better understand the risks in order to help prevent them.2 \"Cardiovascular disease can have a devastating impact on the lives of people with type 2 diabetes and their families,\" said Professor Stephen Gough, global chief medical officer\u00a0of Novo Nordisk. \"The IDF survey findings are striking and reinforce the importance of raising awareness of CVD risk and its impact on people living with type 2 diabetes. We are committed to continue working with IDF while utilising these global findings to inform future efforts that can help improve health outcomes.\" Taking Diabetes to Heart will culminate in a comprehensive report with regional and country-specific results and resources to help support knowledge and awareness of CVD among people with type 2 diabetes and those at risk around the world.

Respondents from over 130 countries participated around the world, with more than 12,000 responses received. The survey is now closed. Results from the survey will be used to inform policy and decision-making around this common and serious complication of diabetes.3 The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) is an umbrella organisation of over 240 national diabetes associations in 168 countries and territories. It represents the interests of the growing number of people with diabetes and those at risk. The Federation has been leading the global diabetes community since 1950.

The REAL 3 trial data were presented today at the 57th Annual Meeting of the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology in Athens, Greece. The trial compared three somapacitan doses (0.04, 0.08 or 0.16 mg\/kg\/wk) to Norditropin\u00ae 0.034 mg\/kg\/day. Annualised height velocity did not differ significantly for the 0.08 and 0.16 mg\/kg\/wk doses compared to Norditropin\u00ae. The mean annualised height velocity for the three dose levels of somapacitan was 8.0 cm, 10.9 cm and 12.9 cm, respectively, as compared to 11.4 cm for daily Norditropin\u00ae. Somapacitan was well tolerated at all doses investigated, with no clinically relevant safety or local tolerability issues identified.1 \"Today children with growth hormone deficiency require daily injections, which can be a considerable treatment burden for patients and caregivers. A once-weekly treatment would represent a significant development for these children and their families, helping them to live less disrupted lives,\" said lead investigator Prof Lars S\u00e4vendahl of the Karolinska Institutet and Pediatric Endocrinology Unit, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. \"The injection fatigue following years of daily administration could negatively impact adherence, thereby leading to worse treatment outcomes,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"In line with our long-term commitment, we are investigating the potential of somapacitan as a once-weekly growth hormone treatment for children with growth hormone deficiency.\" REAL 3 was a multinational, randomised, parallel-group, active-controlled trial with the primary endpoint to evaluate the efficacy of multiple dose regimens of once-weekly somapacitan after 26 weeks of treatment in 59 growth hormone treatment-na\u00efve pre-pubertal children with growth hormone deficiency, compared to daily Norditropin\u00ae administration. Participants were randomised to either a dose of somapacitan (0.04, 0.08 or 0.16 mg\/kg\/wk) or Norditropin\u00ae 0.034 mg\/kg\/day. The trial demonstrated dose dependency with no statistically significant difference in height velocity between somapacitan and daily growth hormone at the two upper doses of somapacitan. The mean annualised height velocity for the three dose levels of somapacitan was 8.0 cm, 10.9 cm and 12.9 cm, respectively, as compared to 11.4 cm for daily Norditropin\u00ae. The observed safety profile in the trial was consistent with that known for Norditropin\u00ae.1,2 Somapacitan is a long-acting analogue of human growth hormone which is under investigation as a possible treatment for growth hormone deficiency. Somapacitan is built on the near twenty year-long protein technology applied for prolongations of insulins, GLP-1 and now growth hormone. Somapacitan has been modified from native human growth hormone to increase its binding to the plasma protein albumin, making it suitable for once-weekly dosing.3 Childhood growth hormone deficiency is a rare condition in which there is not enough growth hormone circulating in the blood to ensure normal growth. Affected children experience slowed or halted growth from the age of two to three years onwards. If treatment is started early, affected children may grow to a normal height. Currently available growth hormone treatments must be administered as a daily subcutaneous injection.4-6 Further information ______________________  References 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 S\u00e4vendal L, Rasmussen MH, Horikawa R, et al.

These are the first grants made to the ambitious partnership that aims to initially raise 100 million dollars to fund the mobilisation of knowledge, tools, capacities and finances to scale-up action to defeat NCDs in low-resource countries. Through four tracks of action the Partnership will contribute to: For the Danish government, this grant is a way to show its commitment to developing and strengthening partnerships as an essential part of the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 set by the UN. \"We believe that this Partnership has high potential to address the increasing burden connected with diabetes and hypertension in low-resource countries in a new and innovative way. If we are to fulfil the promises of the Sustainable Development Goals we must engage with new partners and move out of the comfort zone of the usual development engagements,\" says Ulla T\u00f8rn\u00e6s, Minister for Development Cooperation, Denmark. For Novo Nordisk, this Partnership is a critical next step in improving access to diabetes care in low-resource countries where inefficient procurement and supply chains can result in high prices for patients due to mark-ups and shortage of essential NCD medicines. In supporting Defeat-NCD, Novo Nordisk will continue to optimise its supply chain procedures and share its knowledge on handling and distributing cold chain products. \"From experience, we know that the inefficient procurement and supply chains in many low-resource countries are critical barriers between life-saving medicines and the people who need them most. We hope that this Partnership can simplify processes around the tender bidding and ensure efficient supply of low-cost human insulin,\" says Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen, CEO of Novo Nordisk. The next step for the Partnership is to expand the number of partners to accelerate progress within the four tracks at national level in low-resource countries. About the Defeat-NCD PartnershipThe mission of the Defeat-NCD Partnership is to enable and assist all low-resource countries to scale-up action on NCDs. NCDs threaten progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which has a specific target (SDG 3.4) of reducing premature deaths from NCDs by one-third by 2030. The partnership will initially focus on diabetes and hypertension - conditions that are closely related and that contribute to the burden of premature death and disability caused by NCDs.2,3 Subsequently, the Partnership will address other NCDs of major prevalence and impact such as certain cancers and lung conditions. The Defeat-NCD Partnership was established in January 2018 to help tackle the most significant global health challenge of the century - NCDs. The public-private partnership is hosted by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) and includes governments, multilateral agencies, civil society, academia, philanthropic foundations and the private sector.

Bevillingerne er de f\u00f8rste til det ambiti\u00f8se partnerskab, der i f\u00f8rste omgang har sat sig som m\u00e5l at rejse 100 mio. dollars. Form\u00e5let er at bidrage til mobilisering af viden, v\u00e6rkt\u00f8jer, kompetencer og finansiering for at styrke indsatsen for at bek\u00e6mpe ikke-smitsomme sygdomme (non-communicable diseases, NCD) i lav- og middelindkomstlande. Partnerskabet vil bidrage indenfor fire fokusomr\u00e5der: For den danske regering er bevillingen en m\u00e5de at vise sit engagement i at udvikle og styrke partnerskaber som et vigtigt skridt p\u00e5 vejen til opn\u00e5else af FN's verdensm\u00e5l for b\u00e6redygtig udvikling i 2030. \"Vi tror, at dette partnerskab har stort potentiale til at adressere den stigende byrde for\u00e5rsaget af diabetes og forh\u00f8jet blodtryk i lav- og middelindkomstlande p\u00e5 en ny og innovativ m\u00e5de. Hvis vi skal leve op til verdensm\u00e5lene, er vi n\u00f8dt til at bev\u00e6ge os udenfor vores komfortzone med nye partnerskaber og nye udviklingssamarbejder,\" siger minister for udviklingssamarbejde Ulla T\u00f8rn\u00e6s. For Novo Nordisk er partnerskabet et vigtigt n\u00e6ste skridt i forhold til at forbedre adgangen til diabetesbehandling i lav- og middelindkomstlande, hvor ineffektive indk\u00f8bssystemer og prisforh\u00f8jelser i distributionsleddene kan medf\u00f8re h\u00f8je priser for patienterne og mangel p\u00e5 livsvigtige l\u00e6gemidler til behandling af ikke-smitsomme sygdomme. Ved at st\u00f8tte Defeat-NCD Partnership vil Novo Nordisk forts\u00e6tte med at optimere processerne omkring distributionsleddene og dele sin viden om h\u00e5ndtering og distribution af k\u00f8lekr\u00e6vende medicinske produkter. \"Vi ved af erfaring, at ineffektive indk\u00f8bssystemer og distributionsled i mange lande med lav- og middelindkomst skaber v\u00e6sentlige forhindringer for at f\u00e5 livsvigtig medicin ud til de mennesker, der har mest brug for det. Vi h\u00e5ber, at dette partnerskab kan forenkle processerne omkring licitationer og sikre en effektiv forsyning af human insulin til overkommelige priser,\" siger Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen, administrerende direkt\u00f8r for Novo Nordisk. N\u00e6ste skridt for partnerskabet er f\u00e5 flere partnere med i projektet for at fremskynde indsatsen indenfor de fire fokusomr\u00e5der p\u00e5 nationalt niveau i lav- og middelindkomstlande. Missionen for Defeat-NCD Partnership er at hj\u00e6lpe alle lav- og middelindkomstlande med at styrke indsatsen mod ikke-smitsomme sygdomme. Ikke-smitsomme sygdomme truer fremgangen for den globale 2030-b\u00e6redygtighedsagenda, som har et specifikt m\u00e5l (SDG 3.4) om at reducere for tidlige d\u00f8dsfald som f\u00f8lge af ikke-smitsomme sygdomme med en tredjedel inden 2030. Partnerskabet vil i f\u00f8rste omgang fokusere p\u00e5 diabetes og forh\u00f8jet blodtryk - sygdomme, der er t\u00e6t forbundne, og som bidrager til problemet med for tidlig d\u00f8d og invaliditet som f\u00f8lge af ikke-smitsomme sygdomme.2,3 Senere vil partnerskabet adressere andre alvorlige og almindeligt udbredte ikke-smitsomme sygdomme, herunder visse kr\u00e6ftsygdomme og lungelidelser. Defeat-NCD Partnership blev etableret i januar 2018 for at im\u00f8deg\u00e5 \u00e5rhundredets st\u00f8rste globale sundhedsudfordring: ikke-smitsomme sygdomme. Det offentligt-private partnerskab er forankret i FN's kontor for projektledelse (UNOPS) og omfatter regeringer, multilaterale organisationer, civilsamfund, filantropiske fonde og den private sektor.

Oral semaglutide is an investigational GLP-1 analogue taken once daily as a tablet. The trial investigated the safety, tolerability and efficacy of 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide compared with 0.75 mg once-weekly dulaglutide in 458 Japanese people with type 2 diabetes. Prior to enrolment, participants were inadequately controlled on one oral antidiabetic drug. The trial achieved its primary objective by demonstrating a comparable number of adverse events with oral semaglutide compared to 0.75 mg dulaglutide. The proportion of people treated with 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide who experienced gastro-intestinal adverse events were 31%, 39% and 54%, respectively, compared to 40% with dulaglutide; the most frequently reported events being constipation and nausea. The proportion of people who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was between 3% and 6% of people treated with oral semaglutide, compared to 3% of people treated with dulaglutide. Two distinct statistical approaches to evaluating the efficacy of oral semaglutide vs dulaglutide were applied in the PIONEER 10 trial; a primary statistical approach[1] evaluating the effect regardless of discontinuation of treatment and use of rescue medication, and a secondary statistical approach[2] describing the effect while on treatment and without use of rescue medication. When applying the primary statistical approach, statistically significantly greater reductions in HbA1c and body weight were seen with oral semaglutide 14 mg than 0.75 mg dulaglutide at week 52. When applying the secondary statistical approach, from a baseline of 8.3%, people treated with 14 mg oral semaglutide experienced a statistically significantly greater reduction in HbA1c of 1.8% compared to 1.3% with 0.75 mg dulaglutide after 52 weeks. The reductions in HbA1c were 0.7% and 1.4% for people treated with 3 and 7 mg oral semaglutide, respectively. Reductions in body weight from baseline were also statistically significantly greater with 14 mg oral semaglutide at week 52, with a reduction of 1.9 kg compared to a weight gain of 1.1 kg with dulaglutide. People treated with 3 and 7 mg oral semaglutide experienced a weight gain of 0.1 kg and weight reduction of 1.0 kg, respectively. In addition, applying the secondary statistical approach, The Japanese Diabetes Society (JDS)\u00a0 treatment target of HbA1c below 6.5% was achieved by 21%, 43% and 58% of people on treatment with 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide, respectively, compared to 41% of the people treated with 0.75 mg dulaglutide.\u00a0(TEXT UPDATED 28 SEPT 2018) \"Many people with type 2 diabetes in Japan remain uncontrolled on oral antidiabetic treatments,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"When adding oral semaglutide to the treatment of this group of people, this study has demonstrated that oral semaglutide is both well tolerated and more efficacious compared to subcutaneous dulaglutide.\" About PIONEER 10 and the PIONEER clinical trial programmePIONEER 10 was a 57-week, randomised, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-centre, single country trial with four treatment arms comparing the safety, tolerability and efficacy of 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide with 0.75 mg dulaglutide (the approved dose by the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in Japan) in Japanese people with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with one oral antidiabetic drug (sulfonylurea, glinide, thiazolidinedione, alpha-glucosidase inhibitor or sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor). PIONEER 10 randomised 458 people in a 2:2:2:1 manner to receive either a dose of oral semaglutide 3, 7 or 14 mg once daily or 0.75 mg dulaglutide once weekly. The primary endpoint was the number of adverse events during exposure to the drug, assessed up to 57 weeks. Key secondary endpoints included the change from baseline to week 26 and 52 in HbA1c and change from baseline to week 26 and 52 in body weight. The PIONEER phase 3a clinical development programme for oral semaglutide is a global development programme with enrolment of 8,845 people with type 2 diabetes across 10 clinical trials, which are all expected to complete in 2018.

Studiet opfyldte sit prim\u00e6re m\u00e5l, idet det viste et sammenligneligt antal bivirkninger med oral semaglutid sammenlignet med 0,75 mg dulaglutid. Andelen af deltagere i behandling med 3, 7 og 14 mg oral semaglutid, som oplevede mave-tarm-bivirkninger, var henholdsvis 31%, 39% og 54%, mod 40% med dulaglutid; de hyppigst rapporterede bivirkninger var forstoppelse og kvalme. Andelen af deltagere, som afsluttede behandlingen f\u00f8r tid p\u00e5 grund af bivirkninger, var mellem 3% og 6% for deltagere, der blev behandlet med oral semaglutid, mod 3% for deltagere, der blev behandlet med dulaglutid. Der blev i PIONEER 10 anvendt to forskellige statistiske metoder til vurdering af effekten af oral semaglutid sammenlignet med dulaglutid: en prim\u00e6r statistisk metode[1], som vurderer effekten uanset oph\u00f8r af behandlingen og brug af anden behandling; og en sekund\u00e6r statistisk metode[2], der beskriver effekten, mens behandlingen p\u00e5g\u00e5r og uden brug af anden behandling. Vurderet efter den prim\u00e6re statistiske metode s\u00e5s statistisk signifikant st\u00f8rre reduktioner i langtidsblodsukker (HbA1c) og v\u00e6gt ved behandling med 14 mg oral semaglutid end ved behandling med 0,75 mg dulaglutid ved uge 52.

To enable increased investment in transformational biological and technological innovation within both core and new therapy areas, approximately 400 employees will be laid off from R&D roles in Denmark and China. To support its strategic ambitions, Novo Nordisk will establish four Transformational Research Units in 2018 to pursue novel treatment modalities and platform technologies. The biotech-like units, based in Denmark, the US and the UK, will operate as satellites of Novo Nordisk's central R&D function and will drive innovation in priority fields such as translational cardio-metabolic research and stem cell research. Furthermore, to drive a faster and more efficient path towards lead molecule selection and development, Novo Nordisk will significantly increase its investment in automation and digital capabilities including machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). The integration of laboratory infrastructure and IT systems will also be prioritised to increase the efficiency of the R&D organisation. \"Delivering on our ambition of achieving even higher levels of innovation across a broader and more diverse range of chronic diseases requires that we have the optimal future skill base and allocate resources to our priority areas,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, chief science officer, Novo Nordisk. \"Unfortunately, this implies that a number of valued colleagues will lose their jobs in order to ensure that we have sufficient new research capabilities needed to support our long-term growth ambitions.\" The restructuring and re-allocation of resources supports Novo Nordisk's ambition to transform the way it works within R&D in order to identify and develop truly innovative drug candidates. This will be facilitated by the identification and pursuit of new therapeutic approaches based on external collaborations - a priority that Novo Nordisk will accelerate via the establishment of a new Business Development unit in Cambridge, MA, US. To date in 2018, Novo Nordisk has announced a range of external agreements. \u00a0These include the acquisition of the UK-based biotech start-up Ziylo to enhance research within glucose-responsive insulins and a number of partnership agreements with universities and biotech in the fields of cardio-metabolic and stem cell research. \"Thanks to our exciting internal assets and external partnerships, we are well-positioned to continue our leadership position by providing innovation that improves the health of people living with serious chronic diseases,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen.

The comparators included in SUSTAIN 1-5 were placebo, sitagliptin, exenatide extended release and insulin glargine U100. The overall incidence of MACE was low across the SUSTAIN 1-5 trials and, due to the low number of events, this reduction did not achieve statistical significance.1 About Ozempic\u00aeOzempic\u00ae\u00a0(semaglutide) is a once-weekly analogue of human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes, as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications, or in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes.3 Ozempic\u00ae was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on 5 December, 2017, by Health Canada on 4 January, 2018, by the European Commission on 9 February, 2018 and on 23 March, 2018 by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.4-7 About the SUSTAIN clinical trial programmeThe SUSTAIN global clinical development programme for Ozempic\u00ae comprises eight phase 3a trials, encompassing more than 8,000 adults with type 2 diabetes. The phase 3a programme involves a broad range of people with type 2 diabetes, including some with high cardiovascular risk profiles. The primary analysis of the SUSTAIN 6 trial was published in The New England Journal of Medicine.2 The primary outcome measure was a composite outcome of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or cardiovascular death. Ozempic\u00ae treated patients had a significant 26% lower risk of MACE vs those receiving placebo over 2 years (hazard ratio 0.74; 95% confidence interval 0.58-0.95).2 SUSTAIN 6 was designed to assess non-inferiority, i.e. demonstrate no increased risk of major cardiovascular events vs placebo, when added to standard of care. Testing for superiority was not part of the pre-specified analysis. About Novo Nordisk Novo Nordisk is a global healthcare company with 95 years of innovation and leadership in diabetes care.

Disse resultater pr\u00e6senteres i dag p\u00e5 ESC Congress 2018 arrangeret af European Society of Cardiology i M\u00fcnchen i Tyskland.1 \"Hjerte-kar-sygdom er den hyppigste \u00e5rsag til invaliditet og d\u00f8d hos mennesker med type 2-diabetes, og l\u00e6gerne har i stigende grad fokus p\u00e5 at reducere risikoen for hjerte-kar-sygdom,\" siger professor Stephen Bain, School of Medicine, Swansea University, Storbritannien. \"Vi har i kliniske studier set, at forskellige diabetesbehandlinger har forskellig effekt p\u00e5 forekomsten af hjerte-kar-sygdom. Disse post hoc-analyser dokumenterer yderligere, at Ozempic\u00ae gennemg\u00e5ende reducerer hjerte-kar-risikoen hos mennesker med type 2-diabetes, selvom deres kardiovaskul\u00e6re risikoprofiler som udgangspunkt er forskellige.\" Post hoc-analyserne af SUSTAIN 6 viste, at risikoen for alvorlig kardiovaskul\u00e6r sygelighed gennemg\u00e5ende blev reduceret hos mennesker med h\u00f8j risiko for hjerte-kar-sygdom, som blev behandlet med Ozempic\u00ae, uanset deres kardiovaskul\u00e6re risikoprofil ved studiets begyndelse, herunder uanset om de tidligere havde haft et hjerteanfald eller et slagtilf\u00e6lde, og uanset om de havde kardiovaskul\u00e6re risikofaktorer eller konstateret hjerte-kar-sygdom.1 SUSTAIN 6-studiet, som blev gennemf\u00f8rt f\u00f8r godkendelsen af Ozempic\u00ae, unders\u00f8gte forekomsten af hjerte-kar-sygdom hos 3.297 mennesker med type 2-diabetes og konstateret hjerte-kar-sygdom eller mindst \u00e9n kardiovaskul\u00e6r risikofaktor, sammenlignet med placebo, begge givet som supplement til standardbehandling.2 Den samlede post hoc-metaanalyse af effektstudierne SUSTAIN 1-5 med tilsammen 4.807 deltagere viste en tendens til lavere risiko for alvorlig kardiovaskul\u00e6r sygelighed hos deltagere i behandling med Ozempic\u00ae. De behandlinger, der blev sammenlignet med i SUSTAIN 1-5, var placebo, sitagliptin, exenatid extended release og insulin glargin U100. Den samlede forekomst af alvorlig kardiovaskul\u00e6r sygelighed var lav i alle SUSTAIN 1-5-studierne, og p\u00e5 grund af det lave antal h\u00e6ndelser var denne reduktion ikke statistisk signifikant.1 Ozempic (semaglutid) er en ugentlig analog af det naturlige hormon glukagonlignende peptid-1 (GLP-1), der er godkendt til behandling af voksne med utilstr\u00e6kkeligt reguleret type 2-diabetes som supplement til di\u00e6t og motion med henblik p\u00e5 at forbedre blodsukkerreguleringen hos voksne med type 2-diabetes, som monoterapi, n\u00e5r metformin ikke er hensigtsm\u00e6ssig p\u00e5 grund af intolerans eller kontraindikation, eller som supplement til andre l\u00e6gemidler til behandling af diabetes.3 Ozempic\u00ae blev godkendt af de amerikanske sundhedsmyndigheder (FDA) den 5. december 2017, af de canadiske sundhedsmyndigheder (Health Canada) den 4. januar 2018, af Europa-Kommissionen den 9. februar 2018 og af det japanske sundhedsministerium (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare) den 23. marts 2018.4-7 Det globale kliniske udviklingsprogram SUSTAIN med Ozempic\u00ae omfatter otte fase 3a-studier med en samlet deltagelse af flere end 8.000 voksne med type 2-diabetes. Fase 3a-programmet omfatter en bred vifte af mennesker med type 2-diabetes, herunder deltagere med h\u00f8j risiko for hjerte-kar-sygdom. Den prim\u00e6re analyse af SUSTAIN 6-studiet blev publiceret i The New England Journal of Medicine.2 Det prim\u00e6re endepunkt var forekomsten af alvorlige kardiovaskul\u00e6re h\u00e6ndelser, defineret som ikke-d\u00f8deligt myokardieinfarkt (hjerteanfald), ikke-d\u00f8deligt slagtilf\u00e6lde eller hjerte-kar-relateret d\u00f8d. Patienter i behandling med Ozempic\u00ae havde en signifikant 26% lavere risiko for alvorlig kardiovaskul\u00e6r sygelighed sammenlignet med dem, der fik placebo, gennem to \u00e5r (risikoratio 0,74; 95% konfidensinterval 0,58-0,95).2 SUSTAIN 6 havde til form\u00e5l at vurdere ikke-inferi\u00f8ritet, dvs. vise ingen \u00f8get risiko for alvorlig kardiovaskul\u00e6r sygelighed sammenlignet med placebo, n\u00e5r det blev givet som supplement til standardbehandling.

Selskabsmeddelelse Nr 68 \/ 2018","158":"Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark, 20 August 2018 - Novo Nordisk today announced the headline results from PIONEER 5, a phase 3a trial with oral semaglutide in adults with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment. Oral semaglutide is an investigational GLP-1 analogue taken once daily as a tablet. The 26-week trial investigated the efficacy and safety of 14 mg oral semaglutide compared with placebo in 324 people with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment inadequately controlled with metformin, sulfonylurea alone or in combination with metformin, or basal insulin alone or in combination with metformin. Two distinct statistical approaches to evaluating the effects of oral semaglutide were applied in the PIONEER 5 trial; a primary statistical approach[1] required by recent regulatory guidance evaluating the effect regardless of discontinuation of treatment and use of rescue medication, and a secondary statistical approach[2] describing the effect while on treatment and without use of rescue medication. The trial achieved its primary objective according to the primary statistical approach by demonstrating statistically significant and superior reductions in HbA1c with oral semaglutide compared to placebo at week 26. Furthermore, people treated with oral semaglutide achieved statistically significant and superior reductions in body weight compared to placebo at week 26. When applying the secondary statistical approach, people treated with oral semaglutide experienced a statistically significantly greater reduction in HbA1c of 1.1% compared to 0.1% with placebo. Reduction in body weight was statistically significantly greater with oral semaglutide at week 26, with a reduction of 3.7 kg compared to 1.1 kg with placebo. From a baseline HbA1c of 8.0%, the proportion of people achieving the American Diabetes Association (ADA) target of HbA1c below 7.0% was statistically significantly greater with 14 mg oral semaglutide, with 64% achieving the target at week 26, compared to 21% with placebo. In this 26-week trial, oral semaglutide was well-tolerated in people with moderate renal impairment, with a profile consistent with GLP-1-based therapies. The most common adverse event for oral semaglutide was mild to moderate nausea. In PIONEER 5, 19% of people treated with oral semaglutide experienced nausea, compared to 8% of people treated with placebo. The proportion of people who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 15% for people treated with oral semaglutide compared to 6% with placebo. \"The results from PIONEER 5 showed that oral semaglutide is efficacious and has a solid safety profile in people with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment, thereby further expanding the solid clinical profile of oral semaglutide,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"Renal impairment is a serious diabetes complication and people with this condition have limited oral anti-diabetic treatment options, and if approved oral semaglutide represents an efficacious new solution for these people.\" About PIONEER 5 and the PIONEER clinical trial programme PIONEER 5 was a 26-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, multinational trial with two arms comparing the efficacy and safety of 14 mg oral semaglutide with placebo in people with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 30-59 ml\/min\/1.73m2) inadequately controlled with metformin, sulfonylurea alone or in combination with metformin, or basal insulin alone or in combination with metformin. PIONEER 5 randomised 324 people in a 1:1 manner to receive either a dose of 14 mg oral semaglutide or placebo once daily. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 26 in HbA1c. Key secondary endpoints included change in body weight, change in fasting plasma glucose from baseline to week 26 and proportion of people achieving HbA1c below 7.0% at 26 weeks. The PIONEER phase 3a clinical development programme for oral semaglutide is a global development programme with enrolment of 8,845 people with type 2 diabetes across 10 clinical trials, which are all expected to complete in 2018.

Oral semaglutid er en ny GLP-1-analog under udvikling, der tages som en tablet \u00e9n gang dagligt. Studiet, som strakte sig over 26 uger, unders\u00f8gte effekten og sikkerheden af 14\u00a0mg oral semaglutid sammenlignet med placebo i 324\u00a0deltagere med type 2-diabetes og moderat nedsat nyrefunktion, som var utilstr\u00e6kkeligt reguleret med metformin, sulfonylurinstof alene eller i kombination med metformin, eller med basalinsulin alene eller i kombination med metformin. Der blev i PIONEER 5 anvendt to forskellige statistiske metoder til vurdering af effekten af oral semaglutid: en prim\u00e6r statistisk metode[1], som kr\u00e6ves i henhold til nye regulatoriske retningslinjer, og som vurderer effekten uanset oph\u00f8r af behandlingen og brug af anden behandling; og en sekund\u00e6r statistisk metode[2], der beskriver effekten, mens behandlingen p\u00e5g\u00e5r og uden brug af anden behandling. Studiet opfyldte sit prim\u00e6re m\u00e5l vurderet ud fra den prim\u00e6re statistiske metode, idet det viste statistisk signifikante og st\u00f8rre reduktioner i langtidsblodsukkeret (HbA1c) ved behandling med oral semaglutid sammenlignet med placebo ved uge 26. Deltagere, der blev behandlet med oral semaglutid, opn\u00e5ede endvidere statistisk signifikante og st\u00f8rre reduktioner i v\u00e6gt sammenlignet med placebo ved uge 26. Ved anvendelse af den sekund\u00e6re statistiske metode opn\u00e5ede deltagere i behandling med oral semaglutid en statistisk signifikant st\u00f8rre reduktion i HbA1c p\u00e5 1,1% mod 0,1% med placebo. Reduktionen i v\u00e6gt var statistisk signifikant st\u00f8rre med oral semaglutid ved uge 26 med en reduktion p\u00e5 3,7\u00a0kg mod 1,1\u00a0kg med placebo. Fra et baselineniveau p\u00e5 8,0% var andelen af deltagere, der n\u00e5ede behandlingsm\u00e5let om HbA1c p\u00e5 under 7,0% som fastsat af American Diabetes Association (ADA), statistisk signifikant st\u00f8rre med 14\u00a0mg oral semaglutid, idet 64% af deltagerne n\u00e5ede m\u00e5let ved uge 26 mod 21% af deltagere, der fik placebo. Oral semaglutid var i dette 26-ugers studie veltolereret hos deltagere med moderat nedsat nyrefunktion med en profil, der var konsistent med GLP-1-baserede behandlinger. Den mest almindelige bivirkning for oral semaglutid var mild til moderat kvalme. I PIONEER 5 oplevede 19% af deltagere i behandling med oral semaglutid kvalme mod 8% af deltagere, der fik placebo. Andelen af deltagere, som afsluttede behandlingen f\u00f8r tid p\u00e5 grund af bivirkninger, var 15% for deltagere, der blev behandlet med oral semaglutid, mod 6% for deltagere, der fik placebo. \"Resultaterne fra PIONEER 5 viser, at oral semaglutid er virkningsfuld og har en robust sikkerhedsprofil hos mennesker med type 2-diabetes og moderat nedsat nyrefunktion; det betyder s\u00e5ledes, at oral semaglutid f\u00e5r en endnu mere solid klinisk profil,\" siger Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, koncerndirekt\u00f8r for forskning og udvikling i Novo Nordisk. \"Nedsat nyrefunktion er en alvorlig komplikation forbundet med diabetes, og mennesker med denne sygdom har begr\u00e6nsede behandlingsmuligheder med diabetesl\u00e6gemidler i tabletform. Hvis godkendt bliver oral semaglutid en ny, virkningsfuld l\u00f8sning for disse mennesker.\" Om PIONEER 5 og det kliniske udviklingsprogram PIONEER PIONEER 5 var et 26-ugers randomiseret, dobbeltblindet, placebo-kontrolleret, multicenter-, multinationalt parallelgruppestudie med to behandlingsgrupper. Studiet unders\u00f8gte effekt og sikkerhed af 14\u00a0mg oral semaglutid sammenlignet med placebo hos mennesker med type 2-diabetes og moderat nedsat nyrefunktion (estimeret glomerul\u00e6r filtreringshastighed [eGFR] 30-59\u00a0ml\/min.\/1,73\u00a0m2), som var utilstr\u00e6kkeligt reguleret med metformin, sulfonylurinstof alene eller i kombination med metformin, eller med basalinsulin alene eller i kombination med metformin. PIONEER 5 omfattede 324\u00a0deltagere, som blev randomiseret 1:1 til at modtage enten en dosis p\u00e5 14 mg oral semaglutid eller placebo \u00e9n gang dagligt. Det prim\u00e6re endepunkt var \u00e6ndring i HbA1c ved uge 26 i forhold til baseline. Vigtige sekund\u00e6re endepunkter var \u00e6ndring i v\u00e6gt, \u00e6ndring i fastende plasmablodsukker fra baseline til uge 26 samt andelen af deltagere, der opn\u00e5ede HbA1c p\u00e5 under 7,0% ved uge 26.

Carbometrics has licenced rights for all non-therapeutic uses of glucose binding molecules including applications in diagnostics and glucose monitoring BRISTOL and COPENHAGEN, 17 August 2018 \u00ad- Ziylo and Novo Nordisk A\/S today announced that Novo Nordisk has acquired all of the shares of Ziylo, a University of Bristol spin-out company based at Unit DX science incubator in Bristol, UK. Ziylo has been pioneering the use of its platform technology - synthetic glucose binding molecules - for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. The acquisition gives Novo Nordisk full rights to Ziylo's glucose binding molecule platform to develop glucose responsive insulins. The development of glucose responsive insulins is a key strategic area for Novo Nordisk in its effort to develop this next generation of insulin which would lead to a safer and more effective insulin therapy. A glucose responsive insulin would help eliminate the risk of hypoglycaemia, which is the main risk associated with insulin therapy and one of the main barriers for achieving optimal glucose control. Thus, a glucose responsive insulin could also lead to better metabolic control and thus overall reduce the burden of diabetes for people living with the disease. Prior to closing of the acquisition, certain research activities have been spun out of Ziylo to a new company, Carbometrics. Carbometrics has entered into a research collaboration with Novo Nordisk to assist with ongoing optimisation of glucose binding molecules for use in glucose responsive insulins. Carbometrics has licenced rights to develop non-therapeutic applications of glucose binding molecules, with a focus on developing continuous glucose monitoring applications. Ziylo's glucose binding molecules are synthetic molecules that were designed by Professor Anthony Davis at the University of Bristol. These stable, synthetic molecules exhibit an unprecedented selectivity to glucose in complex environments such as blood. The combination of this technology with state-of-the-art insulin engineering pioneered by Novo Nordisk aspires to realise the world's first glucose responsive insulin and transform the treatment of diabetes. \"We believe the glucose binding molecules discovered by the Ziylo team together with Novo Nordisk world-class insulin capabilities have the potential to lead to the development of glucose responsive insulins which we hope can remove the risk of hypoglycaemia and ensure optimal glucose control for people with diabetes,\" said Marcus Schindler, senior vice president, Global Drug Discovery, Novo Nordisk. \"Novo Nordisk is the ideal company to maximise the potential of the Ziylo glucose binding molecules in glucose responsive insulins and diabetes applications, and it brings hope of a truly groundbreaking treatment to diabetes patients,\" said Harry Destecroix, PhD, chief executive officer and co-founder of Ziylo. \"Novo Nordisk is the leader in the diabetes field, with deep clinical development and regulatory expertise and an established commercial infrastructure to deliver important new therapies to patients.\" Novo Nordisk acquires all shares in Ziylo for an upfront payment and earn-outs with contingent milestone payments. Total payments under the agreement could ultimately exceed 800 million dollars upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestones by Novo Nordisk.

Ziylo har v\u00e6ret pioner indenfor anvendelse af selskabets platformteknologi - syntetiske glukosebindende molekyler - til behandling og diagnostik. K\u00f8bet giver Novo Nordisk de fulde rettigheder til Ziylos platformteknologi med henblik p\u00e5 udvikling af glukoseresponsive insuliner. Udvikling af glukoseresponsive insuliner er et vigtigt strategisk omr\u00e5de for Novo Nordisk i relation til arbejdet med at udvikle den n\u00e6ste generation af insulin, der ventes at f\u00f8re til sikrere og mere virkningsfuld behandling. En glukoseresponsiv insulin ville kunne hj\u00e6lpe med til at eliminere risikoen for hypoglyk\u00e6mi (lavt blodsukker), som er den v\u00e6sentligste risiko i forbindelse med insulinbehandling og en af de st\u00f8rste barrierer for at opn\u00e5 optimal blodsukkerregulering. En glukoseresponsiv insulin vil s\u00e5ledes ogs\u00e5 kunne forbedre den metaboliske kontrol og dermed samlet set mindske generne ved diabetes for dem, der har sygdommen. Forud for indg\u00e5else af aftalen er visse forskningsaktiviteter blevet skilt ud fra Ziylo og placeret i et nyt selskab ved navn Carbometrics. Carbometrics er indg\u00e5et i et forskningssamarbejde med Novo Nordisk for at hj\u00e6lpe med den l\u00f8bende optimering af glukosebindende molekyler til brug i glukoseresponsive insuliner. Carbometrics har f\u00e5et licensrettighederne til udvikling af ikke-terapeutiske anvendelser af glukosebindende molekyler med fokus p\u00e5 udvikling af anvendelser indenfor kontinuerlig blodsukkerm\u00e5ling. Ziylos glukosebindende molekyler er syntetiske molekyler udviklet af professor Anthony Davis fra University of Bristol. Disse stabile syntetiske molekyler udviser en hidtil uset selektivitet overfor glukose i komplekse omgivelser som f.eks. blod. Ambitionen er, at kombinationen af denne teknologi med Novo Nordisks avancerede insulinforskning vil f\u00f8re til udviklingen af verdens f\u00f8rste glukoseresponsive insulin og revolutionere behandlingen af diabetes. \"Vi er overbevist om, at Ziylos glukosebindende molekyler kombineret med Novo Nordisks verdensklasse-ekspertise p\u00e5 insulinomr\u00e5det vil kunne skabe grobund for udvikling af glukoseresponsive insuliner, som, vi h\u00e5ber, vil kunne fjerne risikoen for hypoglyk\u00e6mi og sikre optimal blodsukkerregulering for mennesker med diabetes,\" siger Marcus Schindler, direkt\u00f8r for Global Drug Discovery i Novo Nordisk. \"Novo Nordisk er den ideelle virksomhed til fuldt ud at udnytte potentialet i Ziylos glukosebindende molekyler i form af glukoseresponsive insuliner og andre diabetesrelaterede anvendelser, og det er vores h\u00e5b, at det vil give helt nye og innovative behandlingsmuligheder for mennesker med diabetes,\" siger Harry Destecroix, ph.d., administrerende direkt\u00f8r for og medstifter af Ziylo. \"Novo Nordisk er f\u00f8rende indenfor diabetes og har en omfattende ekspertise indenfor klinisk udvikling og regulatoriske anliggender. Derudover har de en veletableret kommerciel infrastruktur, s\u00e5 vigtige nye behandlinger kan n\u00e5 ud til patienterne.\" Novo Nordisk overtager den samlede aktiebeholdning i Ziylo mod en forudbetaling samt resultatafh\u00e6ngige milep\u00e6lsbetalinger. De samlede betalinger i henhold til aftalen kan potentielt overstige 800 mio. dollars, s\u00e5fremt Novo Nordisk n\u00e5r visse milep\u00e6le relateret til udvikling, godkendelse og salg.

Oral semaglutide is an investigational GLP-1 analogue taken once daily as a tablet. The 78-week trial investigated the efficacy and long-term safety of 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide compared with 100 mg sitagliptin in 1,864 people with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin, with or without sulfonylurea. The confirmatory endpoints were assessed after 26 weeks of treatment. Two distinct statistical approaches to evaluating the effects of oral semaglutide were applied in the PIONEER 3 trial; a primary statistical approach[1] required by recent regulatory guidance evaluating the effect regardless of discontinuation of treatment and use of rescue medication, and a secondary statistical approach[2] describing the effect while on treatment and without use of rescue medication. The trial achieved its primary objective according to the primary statistical approach by demonstrating statistically significant and superior reductions in HbA1c with oral semaglutide 7 and 14 mg compared to sitagliptin at week 26. Furthermore, people treated with oral semaglutide 7 and 14 mg achieved statistically significant and superior reductions in body weight compared to sitagliptin at week 26. When applying the secondary statistical approach for week 26 and week 78, respectively, people treated with 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide experienced statistically significantly greater reductions in HbA1c of 1.1% and 0.7% with 7 mg oral semaglutide, 1.4% and 1.1% with 14 mg oral semaglutide compared to 0.8% and 0.4% with sitagliptin.\u00a0 Reductions in HbA1c with 3 mg oral semaglutide at 26 and 78 weeks were 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively, and the reduction was statistically significantly less than sitagliptin at 26 week, but was not statistically different at week 78. Reductions in body weight from baseline were statistically significantly greater with 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide at week 26 and 78, respectively, with reductions of 1.2 and 1.9 kg for 3 mg oral semaglutide, 2.2 and 2.7 kg for 7 mg oral semaglutide and 3.3 and 3.5 kg for 14 mg oral semaglutide compared to 0.7 and 1.1 kg with sitagliptin. In this 78-week trial, oral semaglutide was well-tolerated and with a profile consistent with GLP-1-based therapy. The most common adverse event for oral semaglutide was mild to moderate nausea, which diminished over time. In PIONEER 3, 7-15% of people treated with oral semaglutide experienced nausea, compared to 7% of people treated with sitagliptin. The proportion of people who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 6-12% for people treated with oral semaglutide compared to 5% with sitagliptin. \"With the results from the PIONEER 3 trial, we have shown that the two highest doses of oral semaglutide achieved superior improvements in glycaemic control and body weight compared to sitagliptin with a favourable safety profile consistent with GLP-1-based therapy\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"Furthermore, PIONEER 3 is an important trial, as it demonstrates long-term safety and efficacy of oral semaglutide\" About PIONEER 3 and the PIONEER clinical trial programmePIONEER 3 was a 78-week, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, multinational trial with four arms comparing the efficacy and safety of 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide with 100 mg sitagliptin in people with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin, with or without sulfonylurea. PIONEER 3 randomised 1,864 people in a 1:1:1:1 manner to receive either a dose of oral semaglutide 3, 7 and 14 mg or 100 mg sitagliptin once daily. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 26 in HbA1c. Key secondary endpoints included change in HbA1c and body weight from baseline to week 78. The PIONEER phase 3a clinical development programme for oral semaglutide is a global development programme with enrolment of 8,845 people with type 2 diabetes across 10 clinical trials, which are all expected to complete in 2018.

Oral semaglutid er en ny GLP-1-analog under udvikling, der tages som en tablet \u00e9n gang dagligt. Studiet, som strakte sig over 78 uger, unders\u00f8gte effekten og den langsigtede sikkerhed af 3, 7 og 14 mg oral semaglutid sammenlignet med 100 mg sitagliptin i 1.864 deltagere med type 2-diabetes, som var utilstr\u00e6kkeligt reguleret med metformin med eller uden et sulfonylurinstof. De bekr\u00e6ftende endepunkter blev vurderet efter 26 ugers behandling. Der blev i PIONEER 3 anvendt to forskellige statistiske metoder til vurdering af effekten af oral semaglutid: en prim\u00e6r statistisk metode[1], som kr\u00e6ves i henhold til nye regulatoriske retningslinjer, og som vurderer effekten uanset oph\u00f8r af behandlingen og brug af anden behandling; og en sekund\u00e6r statistisk metode [2], der beskriver effekten, mens behandlingen p\u00e5g\u00e5r og uden brug af anden behandling. Studiet opfyldte sit prim\u00e6re m\u00e5l vurderet ud fra den prim\u00e6re statistiske metode, idet det viste statistisk signifikante og st\u00f8rre forbedringer i langtidsblodsukkeret (HbA1c) ved behandling med 7 og 14 mg oral semaglutid sammenlignet med sitagliptin ved uge 26.

Ved anvendelse af den sekund\u00e6re statistiske metode ved henholdsvis uge 26 og uge 78 opn\u00e5ede deltagere i behandling med 7 og 14 mg oral semaglutid statistisk signifikant st\u00f8rre reduktioner i HbA1c p\u00e5 1,1% og 0,7% med 7 mg oral semaglutid, 1,4% og 1,1% med 14 mg oral semaglutid, mod 0,8% og 0,4% med sitagliptin. Reduktionerne i HbA1c med 3 mg oral semaglutid ved uge 26 og uge 78 var henholdsvis 0,5% og 0,3%, og reduktionen var statistisk signifikant mindre end med sitagliptin ved uge 26, men var ikke statistisk forskellig ved uge 78. Reduktionerne i v\u00e6gt i forhold til udgangspunktet ved studiets begyndelse (baseline) var statistisk signifikant st\u00f8rre med 3, 7 og 14 mg oral semaglutid ved henholdsvis uge 26 og 78, med reduktioner p\u00e5 1,2 og 1,9 kg for 3 mg oral semaglutid, 2,2 og 2,7 kg for 7 mg oral semaglutid og 3,3 og 3,5 kg for 14 mg oral semaglutid, mod 0,7 og 1,1 kg med sitagliptin. Oral semaglutid var i dette 78-ugers studie veltolereret med en profil, der var konsistent med GLP-1-baseret behandling. Den mest almindelige bivirkning for oral semaglutid var mild til moderat kvalme, som aftog med tiden. I PIONEER 3 oplevede 7-15% af deltagerne i behandling med oral semaglutid kvalme, sammenlignet med 7% af dem, der fik sitagliptin. Andelen af deltagere, som afsluttede behandlingen f\u00f8r tid p\u00e5 grund af bivirkninger, var 6-12% for deltagere, der blev behandlet med oral semaglutid, mod 5% for deltagere i behandling med sitagliptin. \"Med resultaterne fra PIONEER 3-studiet har vi vist, at de to h\u00f8jeste doser af oral semaglutid medf\u00f8rte st\u00f8rre forbedringer i blodsukkerregulering og v\u00e6gt sammenlignet med sitagliptin med en gunstig sikkerhedsprofil, der var konsistent med GLP-1-baseret behandling,\" siger Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, koncerndirekt\u00f8r for forskning og udvikling i Novo Nordisk. \"Derudover er PIONEER 3 et vigtigt studie, fordi det dokumenterer den langsigtede sikkerhed og effekt af oral semaglutid.\" PIONEER 3 var et 78-ugers randomiseret, dobbeltblindet, dobbelt-placebo- og aktivt kontrolleret, multicenter-, multinationalt parallelgruppestudie med fire behandlingsgrupper. Studiet unders\u00f8gte effekt og sikkerhed af 3, 7 og 14 mg oral semaglutid med 100 mg sitagliptin hos mennesker med type 2-diabetes, som var utilstr\u00e6kkeligt reguleret med metformin med eller uden et sulfonylurinstof.

The trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide compared with placebo as monotherapy over 26 weeks in adults with type 2 diabetes.1 The new data will be presented tomorrow, 24 June, 2018 at the American Diabetes Association's 78th Scientific Sessions (ADA) in Orlando, FL, US. Two distinct approaches to evaluating the effects of oral semaglutide were applied in the PIONEER 1 trial; a primary approach utilising an intention-to-treat principle required by recent regulatory guidance, evaluating the treatment effect including the effect of rescue medication and regardless of premature trial product discontinuation; a secondary approach utilising an on-treatment principle evaluated the treatment effect while on trial product and without use of rescue medication. Applying the intention-to-treat principle, the trial achieved its primary objective by demonstrating that people treated with any of the three doses of oral semaglutide achieved significant HbA1c reductions compared to placebo (p<0.001 for all estimated treatment differences in HbA1c for oral semaglutide vs placebo). Furthermore, people treated with 14 mg oral semaglutide achieved significant reductions (p<0.001) in weight vs placebo while weight reductions with 7 mg and 3 mg doses did not reach statistical significance.1 \"Despite advancements in the diabetes treatment landscape, many people with type 2 diabetes still struggle to reach their HbA1c target,\" said Vanita Aroda, MD, associate director, diabetes clinical research, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, U.S. \"Based on the first results of PIONEER, I am optimistic about the potential of having an oral GLP-1 receptor agonist that may help patients achieve their HbA1c and blood sugar goals.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When applying the on-treatment principle, from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.0%, people treated with 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide achieved HbA1c reductions of 0.8%, 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively, compared to 0.1% with placebo.1 In addition, 59%, 72% and 80% of people, respectively, treated with oral semaglutide achieved the ADA treatment target of HbA1c below 7% compared to 34% treated with placebo.1 Furthermore, when applying the on-treatment principle, people treated with 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide experienced a weight reduction of 1.7 kg, 2.5 kg and 4.1 kg, respectively, compared to 1.5 kg with placebo.1 Moreover, 21%, 29% and 44% of people treated with oral semaglutide achieved a weight reduction of 5% or more compared to 16% with placebo.1 The most common adverse events (>5%) were mild or moderate nausea, which occurred in 5-16% of people treated with oral semaglutide and diminished over time, compared with 6% in those treated with placebo. Overall, adverse events were reported by 58%, 53% and 57% of people treated with 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide, respectively, and in 56% of people treated with placebo. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events ranged from 2% to 7% for people treated with oral semaglutide, compared to 2% for people treated with placebo.1 About oral semaglutide\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Semaglutide is an analogue of human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) that is provided in tablet formulation with an absorption enhancer SNAC (sodium N-(8-[2-hydroxybenzoyl] amino) caprylate).2 SNAC increases the bioavailability of semaglutide, facilitating absorption of semaglutide from the stomach, thereby enabling oral dosing.3 Oral semaglutide is in phase 3 development for blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes. About PIONEER 1 and the PIONEER clinical trial programmePIONEER 1 was a 26-week, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, four-armed, parallel-group, multicentre, multinational trial comparing the efficacy and safety of three dose levels of once-daily oral semaglutide vs placebo in adults with type 2 diabetes treated with diet and exercise only. PIONEER 1 randomized 703 people in a randomised 1:1:1:1 manner to receive either a dose of oral semaglutide (3, 7 or 14 mg) or placebo once daily. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline at week 26. The proportion of patients achieving HbA1c of <7% and change in body weight were secondary endpoints.

While the primary endpoint of SUSTAIN 7 was change in HbA1c, this post-hoc exploratory analysis examined the secondary endpoint of change in body weight by baseline BMI.1 The results will be presented 24 June, 2018 at the American Diabetes Association's 78th Scientific Sessions (ADA) in Orlando, US. Greater weight reductions were demonstrated across all BMI subgroups (<25, 25-<30, 30-<35, >35 kg\/m2) with Ozempic\u00ae 0.5 mg vs dulaglutide 0.75 mg (range of weight reduction across all subgroups: 3.6-5.5 kg vs 0.9-3.4 kg) and with Ozempic\u00ae 1.0 mg vs dulaglutide 1.5 mg (range of weight reduction across all subgroups: 5.2-7.6 kg vs 2.0-3.8 kg), from a mean baseline of 95.2 kg.1 Adults with a higher baseline BMI (>25 kg\/m2) taking Ozempic\u00ae generally achieved greater weight reductions than those with lower baseline BMI (<25 kg\/m2).1 In addition, more people achieved weight reductions of >5% and\u00a0>10% with Ozempic\u00ae vs dulaglutide in all BMI subgroups.1 \"Globally, up to ninety percent of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or have obesity.2 Therefore, it is important to consider how to manage weight in this population,\" said Dr Adie Viljoen, SUSTAIN 7 chief investigator and consultant chemical pathologist, East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, UK. \"Based on the SUSTAIN clinical trial programme, Ozempic\u00ae can help people living with type 2 diabetes manage their HbA1C and has the potential to help them lose some weight.\" Across BMI subgroups, fewer people reported gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events with the low dulaglutide dose (0.75 mg) compared with the other three treatment groups (Ozempic\u00ae 0.5 and 1.0 mg and dulaglutide 1.5 mg).1 The most common adverse events (>5%) for both Ozempic\u00ae dosages were GI adverse events.1 About Ozempic\u00aeOzempic\u00ae\u00a0(semaglutide) is a once-weekly analogue of human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes.3 Ozempic\u00ae was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on 5 December, 2017, by Health Canada on 4 January, 2018, by the European Commission on 9 February, 2018 and on 23 March by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.3-6 About the SUSTAIN clinical trial programmeThe SUSTAIN global clinical development programme for Ozempic\u00ae comprises eight phase 3a trials, encompassing more than 8,000 adults with type 2 diabetes. The phase 3a programme involves a broad range of people with type 2 diabetes, including some with high cardiovascular risk profiles. The primary analysis of the SUSTAIN 7 trial was published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology earlier this year. The primary outcome measure was change in HbA1c from baseline after 40 weeks of treatment. Change in body weight from baseline to week 40 was a predefined secondary endpoint.7 In this post-hoc exploratory analysis, which was conducted using Mixed Models for Repeated Measurements, the interaction effect between treatment and subgroup was not statistically significant (semaglutide 0.5 mg vs dulaglutide 0.75 mg: p= 0.9118; semaglutide 1.0 mg vs dulaglutide 1.5 mg: p= 0.8175).1 Further information ______________________  References: 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Viljoen A, Bl\u00fcher M, Chow F, et al.

The retrospective, non-interventional comparative effectiveness study, which included more than 4,000 adults with type 2 diabetes who were starting basal insulin for the first time, showed that after six months those treated with Tresiba\u00ae had significantly lower HbA1c compared to those treated with insulin glargine U300 (-1.5% vs. -1.2% respectively; p=0.029).1 As a secondary endpoint, there was a 30% lower rate of hypoglycaemic episodes with Tresiba\u00ae compared to insulin glargine U300 (p=0.045).1 In this study, hypoglycaemic events, ranging from mild to severe, were registered using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes 9\/10 following diagnosis from a physician.2 This real-world study also showed in another secondary endpoint that people treated with Tresiba\u00ae were more likely to stay on their treatment. Those treated with insulin glargine U300 had a 37% higher rate of discontinuing treatment after two years (p<0.001).1 \"Real-world studies are important to understanding how clinical trials may translate into real value for patients in everyday clinical practice,\" said Todd Hobbs, vice president and US chief medical officer of Novo Nordisk. \"The CONFIRM results add to the body of evidence on Tresiba\u00ae for adults with type 2 diabetes.\" The CONFIRM study is a retrospective, non-interventional comparative effectiveness study that investigated Tresiba\u00ae and insulin glargine U300 (Toujeo\u00ae) in 4,056 insulin-na\u00efve (defined as no evidence of basal insulin use at least 365 days prior to index date) adults with type 2 diabetes in the US. Study groups were equal in size (n=2,028) and patients in each group were comparable after matching for baseline characteristics. Patients were uncontrolled on one or more oral antidiabetic drugs or a GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonist and prescribed Tresiba\u00ae or insulin glargine U300 according to local practice. Electronic health records were sourced from multiple health systems in the US. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c (blood sugar control) from baseline to six months follow-up. Secondary endpoints included rate of hypoglycaemia, proportion of patients with at least one hypoglycaemic episode and the rate of treatment discontinuation. As with all real-world studies, CONFIRM was not randomised and it carries the limitations of real-world evidence. This includes potential under-reporting of hypoglycaemia (however, this is the case in both treatment arms in CONFIRM meaning that the rate ratio as well as the odds ratio are expected to be preserved), and the short follow-up period of 3-6 months (though this corresponds to when the largest changes in HbA1c tend to occur and is commonly used in many trials). Additionally, in CONFIRM there is only evidence of prescribed basal insulin and not actual use (whether the medication was picked up at the pharmacy). Hypoglycaemia occurs when blood sugar levels are too low and cannot provide the body's organs with the energy they need. Hypoglycaemia can cause a range of symptoms including confusion, trembling, sweating, increased heart rate, difficulty with concentration and speech, and in severe cases can lead to a seizure or coma.3-6 About Tresiba\u00aeTresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) is a once-daily basal insulin that provides a duration of action beyond 42 hours with a flat and stable glucose-lowering effect.7,8 It has been shown to provide a lower risk of overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia, and low variability in blood sugar levels versus insulin glargine U100.8,9 Tresiba\u00ae received its first regulatory approval in September 2012 and has since been approved in more than 80 countries globally. It is now commercially available in more than 61 countries. Further information References 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tibaldi J, Haldrup S, Sandberg V, et al.

Sekund\u00e6re endepunkter omfattede forekomsten af hypoglyk\u00e6mi, andelen af patienter med mindst \u00e9t tilf\u00e6lde af hypoglyk\u00e6mi og hyppigheden af behandlingsfrafald. Som alle andre real-world-studier var CONFIRM ikke randomiseret og er underlagt de begr\u00e6nsninger, der f\u00f8lger med real-world evidens. Det omfatter bl.a. potentiel underrapportering af hypoglyk\u00e6mi (g\u00e6lder dog for begge behandlingsgrupper i CONFIRM, hvilket betyder, at s\u00e5vel rate ratio som odds ratio forventes fastholdt) og den korte opf\u00f8lgningsperiode p\u00e5 3-6 m\u00e5neder (omend det svarer til det tidsrum, hvor de st\u00f8rste \u00e6ndringer i HbA1c almindeligvis forekommer, og er almindeligt anvendt i mange studier). Yderligere er der i CONFIRM-studiet kun evidens for ordineret basalinsulin og ikke for den faktiske brug (om medicinen blev hentet p\u00e5 apoteket). Hypoglyk\u00e6mi opst\u00e5r, n\u00e5r blodsukkeret falder til et meget lavt niveau, s\u00e5 kroppens organer ikke f\u00e5r tilf\u00f8rt den energi, der er n\u00f8dvendig for at fungere. Typiske symptomer er forvirring, rysten, sveden, hjertebanken, koncentrations- og\/eller talebesv\u00e6r og i alvorlige tilf\u00e6lde kramper eller bevidstl\u00f8shed.3-6 Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) er en basalinsulin til dosering \u00e9n gang dagligt med en virkningsvarighed p\u00e5 mere end 42 timer med en flad og stabil blodsukkers\u00e6nkende effekt.7,8. Studier har vist, at Tresiba\u00ae medf\u00f8rer en lavere risiko for generel, natlig og alvorlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi samt en lav variation i blodsukkeret sammenlignet med insulin glargin U100.8,9. Tresiba\u00ae blev godkendt af registreringsmyndighederne f\u00f8rste gang i september 2012 og er siden blevet godkendt i flere end 80 lande verden over.

Mean body weight remained unchanged in the Xultophy\u00ae study group versus a 2.0 kg weight gain with insulin glargine U-100. Treatment with Xultophy\u00ae demonstrated a 58% lower rate of hypoglycaemia versus insulin glargine U-100 (0.37 events\/patient-year of exposure vs 0.90 events\/patient-year of exposure respectively; p=0.0035). The average total daily insulin dose was significantly less with Xultophy\u00ae than insulin glargine U-100 (36 units per day vs 54 units per day respectively; p<0.0001).1 \"Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease that often requires treatment intensification,\" said Dr Athena Philis-Tsimikas, DUAL IX lead investigator and corporate vice president, Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute. \"Xultophy\u00ae may be an appropriate treatment option for those adults who are unable to meet their blood sugar goals on their current medication.\" Adverse events were similar across both treatment groups; the most common adverse events (>5%) in the Xultophy\u00ae treated patients included viral upper respiratory tract infection, headaches, back pain, increased lipase and nausea. The safety profile of Xultophy\u00ae in DUAL IX was consistent with previous Xultophy\u00ae clinical trials.1 Additional DUAL IX patient-reported outcomes will be presented on Monday 25 June at ADA: About DUAL IXDUAL IX was a phase 3b, 26-week, randomised, open-label, multicentre trial conducted in 11 countries including 420 patients. The trial was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of Xultophy\u00ae versus insulin glargine U-100 as add-on therapy in adults uncontrolled on sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i) treatment with or without additional oral antidiabetic drug therapy.2 A hypoglycaemic event in DUAL IX was defined as an event requiring assistance from another person or blood glucose (BG) confirmed (less than 56 mg\/dL) with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia. About Xultophy\u00aeXultophy\u00ae is a once-daily fixed-ratio combination injection of insulin degludec, a long-acting human insulin analogue, and liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. In Europe, Xultophy\u00ae is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control as an adjunct to diet and exercise in addition to other oral medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes.3 In the US, Xultophy\u00ae is called Xultophy\u00ae 100\/3.6, and is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on basal insulin (less than 50 U daily) or liraglutide (less than or equal to 1.8 mg daily). In the US, Xultophy\u00ae 100\/3.6 is not indicated for use as an add-on to oral diabetes medications.4 Further information _______________________  References1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Philis-Tsimikas A, Billings LK, Busch R, et al.

Plainsboro, NJ: Novo Nordisk Inc; November 2016.","174":"Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark, 20 June 2018 - Novo Nordisk today announced the successful completion and headline results of the phase 3a trials PIONEER 4 comparing oral semaglutide as a treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes to Victoza\u00ae (1.8 mg liraglutide) and placebo, and PIONEER 7 comparing oral semaglutide as a treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes to sitagliptin 100 mg. Oral semaglutide is a new GLP-1 analogue taken once daily as a tablet. Two distinct statistical approaches to evaluate the effects of oral semaglutide were applied in the PIONEER 4 and 7 trials; a primary statistical approach[1] required by recent regulatory guidance, evaluating the effect regardless of discontinuation of treatment and use of rescue medication, and a secondary statistical approach[2] describing the effect while on treatment and without use of rescue medication. PIONEER 4PIONEER 4 was a 52-week double-blinded, double-dummy trial investigating the efficacy and safety of 14 mg oral semaglutide compared with Victoza\u00ae 1.8 mg and placebo in 711 people with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin, with or without an SGLT-2 inhibitor. PIONEER 4 achieved its primary objective according to the primary statistical approach by demonstrating a non-inferior reduction in HbA1c and statistically significant and superior weight loss at 26 weeks with oral semaglutide compared to Victoza\u00ae. Furthermore, oral semaglutide provided statistically significant and superior reductions in HbA1c and weight compared to placebo. When applying the secondary statistical approach for week 26 and week 52, respectively, people treated with oral semaglutide experienced a reduction in HbA1c of 1.3% and 1.2% compared to 1.1% and 0.9% with Victoza\u00ae whereas placebo declined by 0.1% and increased by 0.2%. Reductions in HbA1c were statistically significantly greater with oral semaglutide compared to both Victoza\u00ae and placebo. Reduction in body weight from baseline was statistically significantly greater with oral semaglutide at 4.7 and 5.0 kg at 26 and 52 weeks, respectively, compared to 3.2 and 3.1 kg with Victoza\u00ae, and 0.7 and 1.2 kg with placebo. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) treatment target of HbA1c below 7.0% was achieved by 69% of people treated with oral semaglutide, 63% of people treated with Victoza\u00ae and 18% of people treated with placebo after 52 weeks; the difference between oral semaglutide and placebo was statistical significant. In the trial, oral semaglutide was well-tolerated and with a profile consistent with GLP-1-based therapy. The most common adverse event for oral semaglutide was mild to moderate nausea which diminished over time. In PIONEER 4, 20% of people treated with oral semaglutide experienced nausea, compared to 18% of people treated with Victoza\u00ae and 4% of people treated with placebo. The proportion of people who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 11% for people treated with oral semaglutide compared to 9% for people treated with Victoza\u00ae and 4% for people receiving placebo. PIONEER 7PIONEER 7 was a 52-week open-label trial investigating the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide with dose adjustment based on clinical evaluation of glycaemic control and drug tolerability compared with the DPP-IV inhibitor 100 mg sitagliptin in 504 people with type 2 diabetes, inadequately controlled on 1-2 oral antidiabetics. The trial achieved its primary objective according to the primary statistical principle by demonstrating that oral semaglutide was statistically significant and superior to sitagliptin 100 mg in the proportion of people achieving the American Diabetes Association (ADA) treatment target of HbA1c below 7% at week 52. Oral semaglutide also demonstrated statistically significant and superior reductions in body weight versus sitagliptin. When applying the secondary statistical approach, people treated with oral semaglutide experienced a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c of 1.4% compared to 0.7% with sitagliptin at week 52. From a baseline HbA1c of 8.3%, 63% of people treated with oral semaglutide achieved the target HbA1c below 7% after 52 weeks of treatment compared to 28% of people treated with sitagliptin, and the difference was statistically significant. The reduction in body weight of 2.9 kg with oral semaglutide was statistically significantly greater at week 52 compared to 0.8 kg with sitagliptin. After 52 weeks of treatment, approximately 9% of the people receiving oral semaglutide treatment were receiving 3 mg oral semaglutide, while approximately 31% and 60% were receiving 7 mg and 14 mg oral semaglutide, respectively. In the trial, oral semaglutide was well-tolerated and with a profile consistent with GLP-1-based therapy. The most common adverse event for oral semaglutide was mild to moderate nausea, which diminished over time. In PIONEER 7, 21% of people treated with oral semaglutide experienced nausea, compared to 2% of people treated with sitagliptin. The proportion of people who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 9% for people treated with oral semaglutide compared to 3% for people treated with sitagliptin. \"With the significant one-year results in a real-world dose setting, oral semaglutide was superior to sitagliptin by documenting a greater proportion of people achieving the ADA target,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"At the same time, we have shown that oral semaglutide is even more efficacious in lowering glucose and body weight than the most widely used injectable GLP-1 treatment, Victoza\u00ae\". About PIONEER 4, PIONEER 7 and the PIONEER clinical trial programmePIONEER 4 was a 52-week, randomised, double-blinded, double-dummy, active- and placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, multinational trial with three arms comparing the efficacy and safety of 14 mg oral semaglutide compared to Victoza\u00ae and vs placebo in people with type 2 diabetes, inadequately controlled on metformin with or without a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor. PIONEER 4 randomised 711 people in a 2:2:1 manner to receive either 14 mg oral semaglutide, Victoza\u00ae 1.8 mg, or placebo once daily. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 26 in HbA1c. Key secondary endpoints included change in HbA1c and body weight from baseline to week 52. PIONEER 7 was a 52-week, randomised, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, multinational trial with two arms comparing the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide using a flexible dose adjustment (3, 7 or 14 mg) based on clinical evaluation (glycaemic target and tolerability) of their response to treatment compared with sitagliptin in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, inadequately controlled on 1-2 oral antidiabetics. PIONEER 7 enrolled 504 people randomised 1:1 to receive either oral semaglutide or 100 mg sitagliptin once daily. The primary endpoint was HbA1c below 7% as per the ADA treatment target at week 52. Key secondary endpoints included change in HbA1c and body weight from baseline to week 52. Novo Nordisk plans to report the PIONEER 3 trial comparing 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide with 100 mg sitagliptin before the end of second quarter of 2018. The PIONEER phase 3a clinical development programme for oral semaglutide is a global development programme with enrolment of 8,845 people with type 2 diabetes across 10 clinical trials, which are all expected to complete in 2018.

Der blev i PIONEER 4 og 7 anvendt to forskellige statistiske metoder til vurdering af effekten af oral semaglutid: en prim\u00e6r statistisk metode[1], som kr\u00e6ves i henhold til nye regulatoriske retningslinjer, og som vurderer effekten uanset oph\u00f8r af behandlingen og brug af anden behandling; og en sekund\u00e6r statistisk metode [2], der beskriver effekten, mens behandlingen p\u00e5g\u00e5r og uden brug af anden behandling. PIONEER 4 blev gennemf\u00f8rt som et 52-ugers dobbeltblindet, dobbelt-placebokontrolleret studie, som unders\u00f8gte effekt og sikkerhed af 14 mg oral semaglutid sammenlignet med Victoza\u00ae 1,8 mg og placebo i 711 deltagere med type 2-diabetes, som var utilstr\u00e6kkeligt reguleret med metformin med eller uden en SGLT-2-h\u00e6mmer. PIONEER 4 opfyldte sit prim\u00e6re m\u00e5l vurderet ud fra den prim\u00e6re statistiske metode, idet det viste en ikke-inferi\u00f8r reduktion i langtidsblodsukkeret (HbA1c) og et statistisk signifikant og st\u00f8rre v\u00e6gttab ved 26 uger med oral semaglutid sammenlignet med Victoza\u00ae. Oral semaglutid medf\u00f8rte desuden statistisk signifikante og st\u00f8rre reduktioner i HbA1c og v\u00e6gt sammenlignet med placebo. Ved anvendelse af den sekund\u00e6re statistiske metode ved henholdsvis uge 26 og uge 52 opn\u00e5ede deltagere i behandling med oral semaglutid en reduktion i HbA1c p\u00e5 1,3% og 1,2% mod 1,1% og 0,9% med Victoza\u00ae, mens placebo faldt med 0,1% og steg med 0,2%. Reduktionerne i HbA1c var statistisk signifikant st\u00f8rre med oral semaglutid sammenlignet b\u00e5de med Victoza\u00ae og placebo. Reduktionen i v\u00e6gt i forhold til udgangspunktet ved studiets begyndelse (baseline) var statistisk signifikant st\u00f8rre med oral semaglutid, nemlig 4,7 og 5,0 kg ved henholdsvis 26 og 52 uger, mod 3,2 og 3,1 kg med Victoza\u00ae og 0,7 og 1,2 kg med placebo. Behandlingsm\u00e5let om HbA1c p\u00e5 under 7,0% som fastsat af American Diabetes Association (ADA) blev n\u00e5et af 69% af de deltagere, der blev behandlet med oral semaglutid, 63% af dem, der fik Victoza\u00ae, og 18% af dem, der fik placebo, efter 52 uger; forskellen mellem oral semaglutid og placebo var statistisk signifikant. I studiet var oral semaglutid veltolereret med en profil, der var konsistent med GLP-1-baseret behandling. Den mest almindelige bivirkning for oral semaglutid var mild til moderat kvalme, som aftog med tiden. I PIONEER 4 oplevede 20% af deltagerne i behandling med oral semaglutid kvalme, mod 18% af dem, der fik Victoza\u00ae, og 4% af dem, der fik placebo. Andelen af deltagere, som afsluttede behandlingen f\u00f8r tid som f\u00f8lge af bivirkninger, var 11% for deltagere, der blev behandlet med oral semaglutid, mod 9% for deltagere, der fik Victoza\u00ae, og 4% for deltagere, der fik placebo. PIONEER 7 blev gennemf\u00f8rt som et 52-ugers ikke-blindet studie, som unders\u00f8gte effekt og sikkerhed af oral semaglutid med dosisjustering baseret p\u00e5 klinisk vurdering af blodsukkerregulering og l\u00e6gemidlets tolerabilitet sammenlignet med DPP-IV-h\u00e6mmeren 100 mg sitagliptin i 504 deltagere med type 2-diabetes, som var utilstr\u00e6kkeligt reguleret med 1-2 diabetesl\u00e6gemidler i tabletform. Studiet opfyldte sit prim\u00e6re m\u00e5l vurderet ud fra den prim\u00e6re statistiske metode, idet det viste, at oral semaglutid var statistisk signifikant og bedre end sitagliptin 100 mg med hensyn til andelen af deltagere, der n\u00e5ede behandlingsm\u00e5let om HbA1c p\u00e5 under 7% som fastsat af American Diabetes Association (ADA) ved uge 52. Oral semaglutid viste desuden statistisk signifikante og st\u00f8rre reduktioner i v\u00e6gt sammenlignet med sitagliptin. Vurderet ud fra den sekund\u00e6re statistiske metode opn\u00e5ede deltagere i behandling med oral semaglutid en statistisk signifikant reduktion i HbA1c p\u00e5 1,4% mod 0,7% med sitagliptin ved uge 52. Fra et baseline-HbA1c-niveau p\u00e5 8,3% n\u00e5ede 63% af deltagere i behandling med oral semaglutid behandlingsm\u00e5let om HbA1c p\u00e5 under 7% efter 52 ugers behandling mod 28% af deltagere i behandling med sitagliptin, og forskellen var statistisk signifikant. Reduktionen i v\u00e6gt p\u00e5 2,9 kg med oral semaglutid var statistisk signifikant st\u00f8rre ved uge 52 sammenlignet med 0,8 kg med sitagliptin. Efter 52 ugers behandling fik ca. 9% af de deltagere, der blev behandlet med oral semaglutid, 3 mg oral semaglutid, mens ca. 31% og 60% fik henholdsvis 7 mg og 14 mg oral semaglutid. I studiet var oral semaglutid veltolereret med en profil, der var konsistent med GLP-1-baseret behandling. Den mest almindelige bivirkning for oral semaglutid var mild til moderat kvalme, som aftog med tiden. I PIONEER 7 oplevede 21% af deltagerne i behandling med oral semaglutid kvalme, mod 2% deltagere, der fik sitagliptin. Andelen af deltagere, som afsluttede behandlingen f\u00f8r tid som f\u00f8lge af bivirkninger, var 9% for deltagere, der blev behandlet med oral semaglutid, mod 3% for deltagere i behandling med sitagliptin. \"Disse markante et\u00e5rsresultater, der er opn\u00e5et med et doseringsm\u00f8nster som i klinisk praksis, viste, at oral semaglutid var bedre end sitagliptin, idet de dokumenterede, at en st\u00f8rre andel af patienter n\u00e5ede ADA's behandlingsm\u00e5l,\" siger Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, koncerndirekt\u00f8r for forskning og udvikling i Novo Nordisk. \"Samtidig har vi vist, at oral semaglutid er endnu mere virkningsfuldt med hensyn til at s\u00e6nke blodsukker og v\u00e6gt end Victoza\u00ae, som er den mest udbredte GLP-1-behandling til injektion.\" PIONEER 4 var et 52-ugers randomiseret, dobbeltblindet, dobbelt-placebokontrolleret, aktivt- og placebokontrolleret, multicenter-, multinationalt parallelgruppestudie med tre behandlingsgrupper. Studiet unders\u00f8gte effekt og sikkerhed af 14 mg oral semaglutid sammenlignet med Victoza\u00ae og med placebo hos mennesker med type 2-diabetes, som var utilstr\u00e6kkeligt reguleret med metformin med eller uden en sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT)-2-h\u00e6mmer. PIONEER 4 omfattede 711 deltagere, som blev randomiseret 2:2:1 til at modtage enten 14 mg oral semaglutid, Victoza\u00ae 1,8 mg eller placebo \u00e9n gang dagligt. Det prim\u00e6re endepunkt var \u00e6ndring i HbA1c ved uge 26 i forhold til baseline. Vigtige sekund\u00e6re endepunkter var blandt andet \u00e6ndring i HbA1c og v\u00e6gt ved uge 52 i forhold til baseline. PIONEER 7 var et 52-ugers randomiseret, ikke-blindet, aktivt kontrolleret, multicenter-, multinationalt parallelgruppestudie med to behandlingsgrupper. Studiet unders\u00f8gte effekt og sikkerhed af oral semaglutid ved hj\u00e6lp af fleksibel dosisjustering (3, 7 eller 14 mg) baseret p\u00e5 klinisk vurdering (glyk\u00e6misk behandlingsm\u00e5l og tolerabilitet) af behandlingsrespons sammenlignet med sitagliptin hos mennesker med type 2-diabetes, som var utilstr\u00e6kkeligt reguleret med 1-2 diabetesl\u00e6gemidler i tabletform. PIONEER 7 omfattede 504 deltagere, som blev randomiseret 1:1 til at modtage enten oral semaglutid eller 100 mg sitagliptin \u00e9n gang dagligt. Det prim\u00e6re endepunkt var HbA1c under ADA's behandlingsm\u00e5l p\u00e5 7% ved uge 52. Vigtige sekund\u00e6re endepunkter var blandt andet \u00e6ndring i HbA1c og v\u00e6gt ved uge 52 i forhold til baseline. Novo Nordisk planl\u00e6gger at rapportere resultater fra PIONEER 3-studiet, der har sammenlignet 3, 7 og 14 mg oral semaglutid med 100 mg sitagliptin, inden udgangen af andet kvartal af 2018. PIONEER, det kliniske fase 3a-program for oral semaglutid, er et globalt udviklingsprogram med en samlet deltagelse af 8.845 mennesker med type 2-diabetes i 10 kliniske studier, som alle forventes afsluttet i 2018.

Oral semaglutide is a new GLP-1 analogue taken once daily as a tablet. The 52-week, open label trial investigated the efficacy and safety of 14 mg oral semaglutide compared with 25 mg empagliflozin in 816 people with type 2 diabetes, inadequately controlled on metformin. The confirmatory endpoints were defined after 26 weeks of treatment. Two distinct statistical approaches to evaluating the effects of oral semaglutide were applied in the PIONEER 2 trial; a primary statistical approach[1] required by recent regulatory guidance evaluating the effect regardless of discontinuation of treatment and use of rescue medication, and a secondary statistical approach[2] describing the effect while on treatment and without use of rescue medication. The trial achieved its primary objective according to the primary statistical approach by demonstrating a statistically significant and superior improvement in HbA1c with oral semaglutide compared to empagliflozin at 26 weeks. Difference in weight loss at 26 weeks between oral semaglutide and empagliflozin was not statistically significant when applying the primary statistical approach. When applying the secondary statistical approach, people treated with 14 mg oral semaglutide achieved a statistically significant improvement in HbA1c of 1.4% at 26 weeks and 1.3% at 52 weeks, compared to an improvement in HbA1c of 0.9% and 0.8% with 25 mg empagliflozin at 26 and 52 weeks, respectively. The 14 mg dose of oral semaglutide demonstrated weight loss of 4.2 kg at 26 weeks and 4.7 kg at 52 weeks versus 3.8 kg with 25 mg empagliflozin at both 26 weeks and 52 weeks. The increased weight loss with oral semaglutide was statistically significant compared to empagliflozin at the 52-week time point. In addition, applying the secondary statistical approach, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) treatment target of HbA1c below 7.0% was achieved by 72% of people treated with 14 mg oral semaglutide compared with 47% of people treated with 25 mg empagliflozin at 52 weeks. In the trial, oral semaglutide was well-tolerated and with a profile consistent with GLP-1-based therapy. The most common adverse event for oral semaglutide was mild to moderate nausea, which diminished over time. In PIONEER 2, 20% of people treated with oral semaglutide experienced nausea during the trial. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 11% for people treated with 14 mg oral semaglutide compared to 4% for people treated with 25 mg empagliflozin. \"We are very excited about these results, which demonstrate that people treated with 14 mg oral semaglutide for one year achieved statistically significant reductions in blood glucose and body weight compared to people treated with 25 mg empagliflozin,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"PIONEER 2 is an important milestone in the clinical development of oral semaglutide and we look forward to further understanding the clinical profile of oral semaglutide in the remaining PIONEER trials.\" About PIONEER 2 and the PIONEER clinical trial programmePIONEER 2 was a 52-week, randomised, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, multinational trial with two arms comparing the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide with empagliflozin in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, inadequately controlled on metformin. 816 people were enrolled in PIONEER 2 and randomised 1:1 to receive either 14 mg oral semaglutide or 25 mg empagliflozin once daily. The confirmatory endpoints were change in HbA1c and body weight from baseline to week 26. Key secondary endpoints included change in HbA1c and body weight from baseline to week 52.

I studiet var oral semaglutid veltolereret med en profil, der var konsistent med GLP-1-baseret behandling. Den mest almindelige bivirkning for oral semaglutid var mild til moderat kvalme, som aftog med tiden. I PIONEER 2 oplevede 20% af deltagere i behandling med oral semaglutid kvalme i studiet. Andelen af deltagere, som afsluttede behandlingen f\u00f8r tid som f\u00f8lge af bivirkninger, var 11% for deltagere, der blev behandlet med 14 mg oral semaglutid, mod 4% for deltagere, der fik 25 mg empagliflozin. \"Vi er meget tilfredse med disse resultater, som viser, at mennesker, der er blevet behandlet med 14 mg oral semaglutid i et \u00e5r, opn\u00e5r statistisk signifikante reduktioner i blodsukker og v\u00e6gt i forhold til mennesker, der er blevet behandlet med 25 mg empagliflozin,\" siger Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, koncerndirekt\u00f8r for forskning og udvikling i Novo Nordisk. \"PIONEER 2 er en vigtig milep\u00e6l i den kliniske udvikling af oral semaglutid, og vi ser frem til at opn\u00e5 yderligere indsigt i den kliniske profil for oral semaglutid i de resterende PIONEER-studier.\" PIONEER 2 blev gennemf\u00f8rt som et 52-ugers randomiseret, ikke-blindet, aktivt kontrolleret, multicenter-, multinationalt parallelgruppestudie med to behandlingsgrupper.

PIONEER 2 omfattede 816 deltagere, som blev randomiseret 1:1 til at modtage enten 14 mg oral semaglutid eller 25 mg empagliflozin \u00e9n gang dagligt. De bekr\u00e6ftende endepunkter var \u00e6ndring i HbA1c og v\u00e6gt ved uge 26 i forhold til udgangspunktet ved studiets begyndelse. Vigtige sekund\u00e6re endepunkter var blandt andet \u00e6ndring i HbA1c ved uge 52 i forhold til udgangspunktet ved studiets begyndelse. Det kliniske fase 3a-program for oral semaglutid, PIONEER, er et globalt udviklingsprogram med en samlet deltagelse af 8.845 mennesker med type 2-diabetes i 10 kliniske studier, som alle forventes afsluttet i 2018.

The data were presented this week at both the 25th European Congress on Obesity (ECO 2018) in Vienna, Austria and the 23rd Annual International Meeting of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR 2018) in Baltimore, US.1,2 This retrospective effectiveness study investigated the impact of Saxenda\u00ae treatment in people with overweight and obesity across six weight management clinics in Canada. After six months, people treated with Saxenda\u00ae as an adjunct to diet and exercise achieved 7.1% weight loss from baseline, with 63.4% and 35.2% of people losing >5% and >10% of their body weight, respectively.1,2 Results from the real-world study were in line with those observed in the SCALE clinical trial programme.3 \"Obesity is a chronic and multifactorial disease, requiring a range of treatment options to help people achieve and maintain weight loss,\" said Dr Sean Wharton of the Wharton Medical Clinic, Toronto, Canada and lead investigator of this study.\u00a0\"Weight loss of 5 to 10% can have significant health benefits, including reducing the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. In this study we are seeing real-world evidence of people treated with Saxenda\u00ae achieving clinically meaningful weight loss.\" People treated with Saxenda\u00ae for at least six months also experienced improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors including blood glucose levels and systolic blood pressure.1,2 \"Saxenda\u00ae is an important treatment option for people with obesity and reflects our commitment to help reduce the impact of obesity and improve the health of people living with the disease,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"It is great to see real-world evidence for Saxenda\u00ae, demonstrating that people are experiencing the benefits of Saxenda\u00ae seen in clinical trials.\" Saxenda\u00ae was generally well tolerated, with gastrointestinal side effects being the most frequently reported adverse events. The study objective was to investigate the real-world clinical effectiveness of Saxenda\u00ae in combination with diet and exercise. This retrospective study included a total of 311 people who had received Saxenda\u00ae for weight management, of which 167 people received treatment for at least six months. People whose records were included in the study had an average body mass index (BMI) of 40.7 kg\/m2 and weight of 114.8 kg at baseline.1 Saxenda\u00ae (liraglutide 3 mg) is a once-daily glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue with 97% similarity to naturally occurring human GLP-1,4,5 a hormone that is released in response to food intake.6 Like human GLP-1, Saxenda\u00ae regulates appetite by increasing feelings of fullness and satiety, while lowering feelings of hunger and prospective food consumption, thereby leading to reduced food intake. As with other GLP-1 analogues, Saxenda\u00ae stimulates insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner.4,5 Saxenda\u00ae was evaluated in the SCALE (Satiety and Clinical Adiposity - Liraglutide Evidence) phase 3a clinical trial programme. In Canada, Saxenda\u00ae is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management in adult patients with an initial BMI of\u00a0>30 kg\/m2 (obese), or\u00a0>27 kg\/m2 to <30 kg\/m2 (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbidity such as dysglycaemia (prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus), hypertension, dyslipidaemia or obstructive sleep apnoea.4 Guidance is given in the label that treatment with Saxenda\u00ae should be discontinued after 12 weeks on the liraglutide 3.0 mg\/day dose, if patients have not lost at least 5% of their initial body weight.4 About obesityObesity is a disease7 that requires long-term management. It is associated with many serious health consequences8 and decreased life expectancy.9 Obesity-related complications include type 2 diabetes,8 heart disease,10 hypertension,10 dyslipidaemia,10 obstructive sleep apnoea,11 chronic kidney disease,12 non-alcoholic fatty liver disease13 and certain types of cancer.14,15 It is a complex and multifactorial disease that is influenced by physiological, psychological, environmental, socio-economic and genetic factors.16,17,18 The global increase in the prevalence of obesity is a public health issue that has severe cost implications to healthcare systems.19,20 In 2016, 13% of adults, or approximately 650 million adults, were living with obesity worldwide.19 Further information _______________________ References 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wharton S, Liu A, Pakseresht A, et al.

Det viser nye forskningsdata, som pr\u00e6senteres i denne uge b\u00e5de p\u00e5 den 25. \u00e5rlige europ\u00e6iske fedmekongres, European Congress on Obesity (ECO 2018), i Wien, \u00d8strig, og det 23. \u00e5rlige internationale m\u00f8de i International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR 2018) i Baltimore, USA.1,2 Studiet var et retrospektivt effektivitetsstudie, der unders\u00f8gte virkningen af behandling med Saxenda\u00ae hos overv\u00e6gtige og sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtige personer p\u00e5 seks v\u00e6gttabsklinikker i Canada. Personer, som blev behandlet med Saxenda\u00ae som supplement til di\u00e6t og motion, havde efter seks m\u00e5neder opn\u00e5et et v\u00e6gttab p\u00e5 7,1% i forhold til udgangspunktet ved studiets begyndelse (baseline), idet 63,4% og 35,2% af personerne tabte sig henholdsvis >5% og >10%.1,2 Resultaterne fra dette s\u00e5kaldte real-world-studie, som blev gennemf\u00f8rt i klinisk praksis, var i overensstemmelse med resultaterne fra det kliniske udviklingsprogram SCALE.3 \"Sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt er en kronisk og kompleks sygdom, som kr\u00e6ver flere forskellige behandlingsmuligheder for at hj\u00e6lpe folk til at opn\u00e5 og fastholde v\u00e6gttab,\" siger dr. Sean Wharton fra Wharton Medical Clinic, Toronto, Canada, som er fors\u00f8gsansvarlig for studiet.\u00a0\"Et v\u00e6gttab p\u00e5 5-10% kan have store sundhedsm\u00e6ssige fordele, blandt andet ved at neds\u00e6tte patientens risiko for at udvikle hjerte-kar-sygdom og type 2-diabetes. Vi har i dette studie set, at mennesker, der f\u00e5r Saxenda\u00ae, rent faktisk opn\u00e5r et klinisk betydningsfuldt v\u00e6gttab i den virkelige verden.\" Personer, som blev behandlet med Saxenda\u00ae i mindst seks m\u00e5neder, oplevede desuden forbedringer i kardiometaboliske risikofaktorer, herunder blodsukker og systolisk blodtryk.1,2 \"Saxenda\u00ae er en vigtig behandlingsmulighed for mennesker med sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt og afspejler vores ambition om at medvirke til at mindske p\u00e5virkningen fra denne sygdom og forbedre sundheden for mennesker, der lever med sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt,\" siger Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, koncerndirekt\u00f8r for forskning og udvikling i Novo Nordisk. \"Det er positivt, at det nu ogs\u00e5 er dokumenteret i klinisk praksis, at folk oplever de samme fordele ved Saxenda\u00ae, som vi har set i kliniske studier.\" Saxenda\u00ae var generelt veltolereret, og de hyppigst rapporterede bivirkninger var relateret til mave-tarm-systemet. Studiets form\u00e5l var at unders\u00f8ge virkningen af Saxenda\u00ae i klinisk praksis i kombination med di\u00e6t og motion. Dette retrospektive studie omfattede i alt 311 personer, som havde f\u00e5et Saxenda\u00ae til v\u00e6gtregulering; heraf fik 167 behandling i mindst seks m\u00e5neder. Personer, hvis data var inkluderet i studiet, havde et gennemsnitligt BMI p\u00e5 40,7 kg\/m2 og en v\u00e6gt p\u00e5 114,8 kg ved studiets begyndelse (baseline).1 Saxenda\u00ae (liraglutid 3 mg) er en GLP-1-analog (glukagonlignende peptid-1) til dosering \u00e9n gang dagligt. Molekylet har 97% lighed med kroppens eget GLP-1,4,5 som er et tarmhormon, der frigives, n\u00e5r man spiser.6 Ligesom naturligt GLP-1 regulerer Saxenda\u00ae appetitten ved at \u00f8ge m\u00e6thedsfornemmelsen og d\u00e6mpe signaler om sult og spisetrang, hvilket f\u00f8rer til et lavere madindtag. Som med andre GLP-1-receptoragonister stimulerer Saxenda\u00ae insulinsekretionen og reducerer glukagonsekretionen p\u00e5 en glukoseafh\u00e6ngig m\u00e5de.4,5 Saxenda\u00ae er unders\u00f8gt i det kliniske fase 3a-program SCALE (Satiety and Clinical Adiposity - Liraglutide Evidence). I Canada og EU er Saxenda\u00ae godkendt som supplement til en kaloriefattig kost og \u00f8get fysisk aktivitet til v\u00e6gtregulering hos voksne med et BMI p\u00e5\u00a0>30 kg\/m2 (sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtige), eller\u00a0>27 kg\/m2 til <30 kg\/m2 (overv\u00e6gtige) med mindst \u00e9n v\u00e6gtrelateret komplikation som f.eks. dysglyk\u00e6mi (pr\u00e6diabetes eller type 2-diabetes), forh\u00f8jet blodtryk, dyslipid\u00e6mi eller obstruktiv s\u00f8vnapn\u00f8.4 Indl\u00e6gssedlen indeholder vejledning om, at behandling med Saxenda\u00ae b\u00f8r indstilles efter 12 ugers behandling med 3,0 mg liraglutid dagligt, hvis der ikke er opn\u00e5et et v\u00e6gttab p\u00e5 mindst 5% af startv\u00e6gten.4 Sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt er en sygdom,7 der kr\u00e6ver vedvarende indsats. Den er forbundet med mange alvorlige helbredsm\u00e6ssige f\u00f8lgevirkninger8 og nedsat forventet levetid.9 F\u00f8lgesygdomme til sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt er bl.a. type 2-diabetes,8 hjertesygdom,10 forh\u00f8jet blodtryk,10 dyslipid\u00e6mi,10 obstruktiv s\u00f8vnapn\u00f8,11 kronisk nyresygdom,12 ikke-alkoholisk fedtleversygdom13 og visse former for kr\u00e6ft.14,15 Det er en kompleks sygdom, der er p\u00e5virket af flere forskellige forhold, herunder fysiologiske, psykologiske, milj\u00f8m\u00e6ssige, socio\u00f8konomiske og genetiske faktorer.16,17,18 Den globale stigning i forekomsten af sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt er en trussel mod folkesundheden med betydelig indvirkning p\u00e5 de offentlige sundhedsudgifter.19,20 I 2016 var 13% af verdens voksne befolkning, eller omkring 650 mio. voksne, sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtige.19 Dette er en overs\u00e6ttelse af den originale engelske pressemeddelelse.

Up to 10 cycles of temperature changes and storage at 40\u00b0C did not affect potency.1 About NovoEight\u00aeNovoEight\u00ae\u00a0is a B-domain truncated recombinant human coagulation factor VIII for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A.3 About haemophilia AHaemophilia is a chronic, inherited bleeding disorder that primarily affects males. People with haemophilia A are either missing or have a malfunctioning factor VIII protein, which is needed for proper blood clotting. People with haemophilia A have a tendency to bleed longer than most or to bleed internally into joints, muscles or organs because they are missing this clotting factor. To manage the disease and stop bleeding, people with haemophilia A must replace the missing factor VIII protein, which is accomplished by intravenous injection of the clotting factor.4 Globally, it is estimated that 150,000 people have been diagnosed with haemophilia A.5\u00a0The disease is severely underdiagnosed in developing countries.

This has been made possible through an exclusive collaboration with the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) in which a first milestone in the development of human embryonic stem cell lines has been reached. Under the terms of the agreement with UCSF, Novo Nordisk has licenced a technology to enable the generation of good manufacturing practice (GMP) compliant human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines as well as the rights to further develop these into future regenerative medicine therapies. In early May, the partners reached an important milestone with the inauguration of a new GMP laboratory at UCSF where employees from the university and Novo Nordisk will be working together on deriving the cell lines that are expected to define a new quality standard in production of stem cell-based therapies. After two decades of intensive research focusing on the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into insulin-producing beta cells, Novo Nordisk has now achieved preclinical proof-of-concept. Together with Cornell University, Novo Nordisk has also made significant progress in developing an encapsulation device that will protect the beta cells that are transplanted into patients from attack by the immune system. Novo Nordisk anticipates that the first clinical trial could be initiated within the next few years. \"Finding a cure for diabetes is part of Novo Nordisk's vision and recent progress in our stem cell research and the access to robust and high-quality cell lines raises hopes for people with type 1 diabetes. Our collaboration with UCSF is also expected to accelerate current and future partnerships to develop stem cell-based therapies for treatment of other serious chronic diseases\", said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. Stem cell-based therapy is a rapidly growing field that may produce novel treatments for a number of diseases with high unmet medical needs. The development of GMP grade stem cell lines in collaboration with UCSF has enabled Novo Nordisk to expand the focus on serious chronic diseases beyond diabetes. Through partnerships with the Swedish biotech company Biolamina and Lund University, activities have been initiated to develop stem cell-based treatments for Parkinson's disease. In another partnership with Biolamina and the DUKE National University Singapore Medical School, the research focus is on chronic heart failure and age-related macular degeneration. Novo Nordisk has an ambition to pursue further collaborations to develop stem cell-based therapies for other serious chronic diseases. About stem cellsStem cell-based therapy is emerging as a treatment option for a number of serious chronic diseases. It has the potential to provide novel treatments for diseases with high unmet medical needs where no or inadequate therapies exist. Pluripotent stem cells have an unlimited capacity for self-renewal and the potential to be differentiated into any specialised cell type in the body. The Novo Nordisk stem cell technology platform is based on human embryonic stem cells (hESC) that can be used for generation of cell products for a wide range of therapeutic indications.

Diabetes is a global epidemic, currently affecting around 60 million people in Europe. Hypoglycaemia is a common and serious complication of diabetes, particularly affecting people with diabetes on insulin therapy; very low levels of blood glucose can lead to cognitive decline, cardiovascular events and even death. As much about hypoglycaemia remains unknown, the recently started European research project Hypo-RESOLVE (Hypoglycaemia - Redefining SOLutions for better liVEs) aims to provide researchers and clinicians with more validated data about the condition by: \"Our mission within Hypo-RESOLVE is to provide an evidence-based classification of hypoglycaemia based on secure data from 100 to 150 recently conducted clinical trials,\" explained Dr Bastiaan de Galan, coordinator of Hypo-RESOLVE and internist at the department of Internal Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center, in the Netherlands. \"With this statistical power, we will be able to make valid statements about the glucose thresholds below which hypoglycaemia constitutes a great risk for people living with diabetes.\" Dr Stephen Gough, Global Chief Medical Officer at Novo Nordisk in Denmark and Hypo-RESOLVE project leader added: \"This consortium brings together world leaders from the field of diabetes to reduce the burden of hypoglycaemia. Hypo-RESOLVE paves the way for further research on glucose-lowering interventions that will serve people living with diabetes, clinicians and healthcare companies.\" The voices of people living with diabetes will be at the heart of Hypo-RESOLVE, through the establishment of a Patient Advisory Committee. It will ensure that patients' insights, opinions and wishes are taken into account across all the multiple components of the project. \"Hypoglycaemia presents a huge psychological burden for people with diabetes. We believe that the Patient Advisory Committee will help contribute to a better understanding of the disease's impact on people with diabetes and ultimately help improve their lives,\" said Prof Nam H. Cho, President of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). \"Through this project, we also hope to strengthen public awareness of hypoglycaemia and diabetes generally.\" Hypo-RESOLVE is supported with funding of 26.8 million euros from the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), a joint undertaking of the European Commission and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF), and the Leona M. and Harry B.

M\u00e5let er at finde bedre l\u00f8sninger, som kan mindske belastningen og konsekvenserne af hypoglyk\u00e6mi (lavt blodsukker) i forbindelse med diabetes. Hypo-RESOLVE modtager 26,8 mio. euro i st\u00f8tte fra Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), som er et f\u00e6llesforetagende iv\u00e6rksat af Europa-Kommissionen og European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) og Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust. Diabetes er en global epidemi, som i dag ber\u00f8rer omkring 60 mio. mennesker i Europa. Hypoglyk\u00e6mi er en almindelig og alvorlig komplikation til diabetes, som is\u00e6r rammer mennesker med diabetes i insulinbehandling. Hypoglyk\u00e6mi er en tilstand, hvor blodsukkeret er s\u00e5 lavt, at det p\u00e5virker hjernens funktion og kan f\u00f8re til hjerte-kar-tilf\u00e6lde og i de mest udtalte tilf\u00e6lde d\u00f8dsfald. Der er meget, man ikke ved om hypoglyk\u00e6mi, og form\u00e5let med det nystartede europ\u00e6iske forskningsprojekt er derfor at give forskere og klinikere adgang til flere validerede data om denne tilstand. Det skal ske ved at: \"Vores m\u00e5l med Hypo-RESOLVE er at foretage en evidensbaseret klassificering af hypoglyk\u00e6mi baseret p\u00e5 sikre data fra 100 til 150 nyligt gennemf\u00f8rte kliniske fors\u00f8g,\" forklarer dr. Bastiaan de Galan, koordinator for Hypo-RESOLVE og specialist i intern medicin ved Radboud university medical center i Holland. \"P\u00e5 dette solide statistiske grundlag vil vi mere pr\u00e6cist kunne definere de nedre gr\u00e6nser for blodsukkeret, hvor hypoglyk\u00e6mi udg\u00f8r en stor risiko for mennesker med diabetes.\" Dr. Stephen Gough, global medicinsk direkt\u00f8r for Novo Nordisk i Danmark og projektleder for Hypo-RESOLVE, tilf\u00f8jer: \"Det nye konsortium samler verdens f\u00f8rende akt\u00f8rer p\u00e5 diabetesomr\u00e5det med det form\u00e5l at mindske den belastning, som hypoglyk\u00e6mi medf\u00f8rer. Hypo-RESOLVE baner vejen for yderligere forskning i behandlingstiltag, der kan s\u00e6nke blodsukkerniveauet til gavn for mennesker med diabetes, klinikere og l\u00e6gemiddelvirksomheder.\" Som et centralt element i Hypo-RESOLVE bliver der etableret et r\u00e5dgivende patientudvalg. Udvalget skal sikre, at der bliver taget hensyn til patienternes erfaringer, synspunkter og \u00f8nsker i alle projektets mange aspekter. \"Hypoglyk\u00e6mi er en stor psykisk belastning for mennesker med diabetes. Vi mener, at det r\u00e5dgivende patientudvalg kan hj\u00e6lpe med til at skabe bedre forst\u00e5else for, hvordan hypoglyk\u00e6mi p\u00e5virker mennesker med diabetes, og i sidste ende v\u00e6re med til at forbedre deres livskvalitet,\" siger professor Nam H. Cho, pr\u00e6sident for International Diabetes Federation (IDF). \"Samtidig h\u00e5ber vi med dette projekt at kunne \u00f8ge offentlighedens kendskab til hypoglyk\u00e6mi og diabetes generelt.\" Projektets aktiviteter skydes officielt i gang ved det f\u00f8rste m\u00f8de, som afholdes i Danmark den 16.-17. maj 2018.

The partnership has three building blocks: Today, more than 65 million people are fleeing conflict. Humanitarian and health actors have historically focused their efforts on the acute health threats people face, such as injuries and infectious diseases. Yet, the health needs of people in humanitarian settings, including those who are forcibly displaced and the communities that host them, are far greater. \"Non-communicable diseases are a silent killer and often overlooked during times of armed conflict. All people need access to appropriate health infrastructure and medicines to manage their health. If you look at Yemen, Syria, Iraq and beyond, thousands will remain with life-threatening illnesses if they are not able to receive essential medical supplies such as insulin to treat diabetes\", says Peter Maurer, president of the ICRC. For people living in humanitarian crises, the risk of exacerbating their chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension is 2-3 times higher than it was beforehand. It is estimated that diabetes is the cause of one in four limb amputations in patients at ICRC Physical Rehabilitation Centres in Yemen, Syria and Iraq.[i]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The partnership will aspire to break new ground for ultimately meeting the urgent needs of millions of vulnerable people living with NCDs. \"Our three organisations are committed to addressing these unmet health needs through an explorative partnership that combines our respective areas of expertise,\" says Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen, CEO of Novo Nordisk. Anders Ladekarl, secretary general in the Danish Red Cross adds: \"As partner organisations we will use our influence and scale to do more to address the needs of people living with NCDs in humanitarian crisis, and advocate together with other humanitarian and health actors to promote this agenda. This partnership is a first step in realising our collective aspiration that all people with NCDs in humanitarian settings have access to care.\" To ensure solid data collection and evidence generation, the partnership will collaborate with the Health in Humanitarian Crises Centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) with Director Karl Blanchet as the lead academic partner. The ICRC will contribute its expertise of humanitarian operations and response, especially on providing healthcare to vulnerable populations in fragile and violent settings. Together with the DRC, the ICRC will lead the implementation of demonstration projects on the ground, including identifying people in need of treatment for diabetes and hypertension through the existing network of ICRC-supported health facilities. The DRC will contribute its knowledge on community health outreach and capacity building activities in humanitarian settings with a focus on prevention and management of chronic diseases. It will facilitate access to nationwide networks of civil society groups, providing relevant services in their specific local contexts. It will mobilize staff and volunteers, including health professionals, with significant experience in humanitarian operations and response. Novo Nordisk will adapt its ordering and production procedures to better serve the needs of humanitarian organisations as well as share its knowledge on handling and distributing cold chain products. It will share its wide experience of building capacity to widen access to diabetes care, including supporting the development of educational materials on diabetes prevention and care for a humanitarian context. The financial contribution to the partnership amounts to 21.5 million Danish kroner. The role of LSHTM will be to conduct needs assessment, guide the design of interventions and evaluate the interventions to improve NCD prevention and care in humanitarian settings. The ICRC helps people around the world affected by armed conflict and other situations of violence, doing everything possible to protect their dignity and relieve their suffering, often together with its Red Cross and Red Crescent partners. The ICRC also seeks to prevent hardship by promoting and strengthening humanitarian law and universal humanitarian principles. For more info, visit Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, ICRC.org.

EpiDestiny is eligible to receive more than 400 million US dollars in upfront, development and sales milestone payments and will get royalties on net sales. EpiDestiny and Novo Nordisk will collaborate to develop EPI01 in SCD and beta-thalassaemia. EpiDestiny retains all rights to continue development of EPI01 in oncology. Increasing levels of foetal haemoglobin (HbF) have important clinical benefits in SCD and beta-thalassaemia patients[1]. Elevated HbF correlated with increased red blood cell half-life, reduced number of pain crises and increased life expectancy1. EPI01 is a novel, orally available, disease-modifying therapy to increase HbF and interrupt SCD pathophysiology. EpiDestiny recently completed a phase 1 trial with EPI01 in SCD patients demonstrating increased HbF expression and safety after eight weeks of administration in a small patient cohort[2]. The clinical observations demonstrated the potential for EPI01 to serve as a safe and highly meaningful disease-modifying therapy for SCD. \"This is a great opportunity for Novo Nordisk to enter into a new therapeutic area closely related to our existing biopharmaceutical business and thereby utilise our core R&D and commercial capabilities to make a significant difference for patients living with a serious chronic disease. We are looking forward to working closely with EpiDestiny and their great network among sickle cell disease experts and the sickle cell community. We are confident that together we can make a significant difference for SCD patients and their families globally,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"We would like to extend our gratitude to all the dedicated patients, physicians and nurses who will participate in the clinical studies of EPI01 in SCD and beta-thalassaemia. Further, the collaboration with Novo Nordisk represents an important step in the continued development of EPI01 for patients with this underserved life-threatening disease. We are looking forward to sharing this programme with Novo Nordisk which has a long history of successfully developing and commercialising products within chronic specialty care across the globe\", said Santhosh Vadivelu, PhD, president and chief executive officer of EpiDestiny. \"The support we receive from Novo Nordisk will allow EpiDestiny to invest and explore the full potential of EPI01 within oncology and to pursue our other pipeline compounds in oncology and other indications.\" Sickle cell disease (SCD)[3], is among the most common inherited diseases affecting mostly people of African and Asian origin[4], with an estimated 30 million cases worldwide. \u00a0SCD is caused by mutations in the gene for the haemoglobin beta chain that carries oxygen in red blood cells. The resulting sickle haemoglobin molecule forms large fibrils in red blood cells which renders red blood cells rigid and deformed (sickle-shaped). The sickle-shaped red blood cells tends to aggregate and can block small blood vessels, lead to chronic anaemia, decreasing oxygen delivery and damaging multiple tissues and organs. Damage to organs such as the spleen impairs immunity and causes high risk of infections such as pneumonia. Large vessels in the brain can be affected by the rigid red blood cells and anaemia, leading to overt strokes in 10-15% of children and silent strokes in many more. Chronic anaemia also affects the heart and lungs, contributing to a life expectancy which may be reduced by several decades, since there are limited medicines that address the root cause of the disease. Beta-thalassaemia[5] is a related group of red blood cell diseases, also arising in human evolution because of malaria, and also caused by mutations in the gene for the haemoglobin beta chain. Instead of producing a mutated haemoglobin molecule, not enough of the haemoglobin chain is produced, leading to varying degrees of anaemia and decreased oxygen delivery. The most severe cases of beta-thalassaemia, thalassaemia major, require regular blood transfusions. The blood transfusions, although initially life-saving, eventually cause too much iron to accumulate in the body; this affects the heart and eventually causes death. EPI01 is an oral, fixed dose formulation of a DNA methyl-transferase enzyme 1 and cytidine deaminase inhibitor, decitabine and tetrahydrouridine, which has potential to work by increasing the amount of foetal haemoglobin that can substitute the defective haemoglobin in SCD patients, thereby intending to prevent the deformation of the red blood cells and improving the oxygen level in the blood. EpiDestiny has been granted Rare Pediatric Disease, Fast Track and Orphan Designations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for EPI01. EpiDestiny is a privately held, clinical stage biopharmaceutical company. Our goal is to spearhead a new era of gene control therapies that use small molecules to treat inherited and acquired genetic diseases such as sickle cell disease, beta-thalassaemia and cancer. Our mission is to provide access to disease modifying therapies to patients and transform the way patients are treated worldwide.\u00a0For more information, visit epidestiny.com, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube.

Novo Nordisk betaler mere end 400 mio. amerikanske dollars i samlede betalinger best\u00e5ende af milep\u00e6lsbetalinger relateret til udvikling og salg samt betaling ved underskrift af aftalen; EpiDestiny vil derudover modtage royalties af det fremtidige salg. EpiDestiny og Novo Nordisk vil samarbejde om at udvikle EPI01 til de to indikationer SCD og beta-talass\u00e6mi. EpiDestiny beholder alle rettigheder til at forts\u00e6tte udviklingen af EPI01 til onkologiske anvendelser. For\u00f8gelse af niveauet af f\u00f8talt h\u00e6moglobin (HbF) har vigtige kliniske fordele for patienter med SCD og beta-talass\u00e6mi[1]. For\u00f8gede m\u00e6ngder af HbF resulterer i for\u00f8get levetid af de r\u00f8de blodlegemer, f\u00e6rre smertetilf\u00e6lde og en h\u00f8jere forventet levealder1. EPI01 er en ny oral behandling, der sigter mod at modificere sygdomsbilledet ved at \u00f8ge dannelsen af HbF og derved mindske SCD-symptomerne. EpiDestiny har for nylig f\u00e6rdiggjort et klinisk fase 1-studie med EPI01 i SCD-patienter. Studiet viste for\u00f8get ekspression af HbF samt sikkerhed efter otte ugers dosering i en mindre SCD-patientpopulation[2]. De kliniske observationer viste, at EPI01 har potentiale til at fungere som en sikker og s\u00e6rdeles betydningsfuld sygdomsmodificerende behandling af SCD. \"Dette er en fantastisk mulighed for Novo Nordisk for at etablere sig p\u00e5 et nyt terapeutisk omr\u00e5de, der er t\u00e6t p\u00e5 vores eksisterende biofarmaceutiske forretning, og for at anvende vores kernekompetencer indenfor forskning, udvikling og markedsf\u00f8ring til at g\u00f8re en v\u00e6sentlig forskel for patienter med en alvorlig kronisk sygdom. Vi ser frem til at arbejde t\u00e6t sammen med EpiDestiny, som har et stort netv\u00e6rk blandt eksperter og patientforeninger indenfor SCD. Vi har stor tiltro til, at Novo Nordisk og EpiDestiny sammen kan g\u00f8re en v\u00e6sentlig forskel for SCD-patienter og deres familier verden over,\" siger Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, koncerndirekt\u00f8r for forskning og udvikling i Novo Nordisk. \"Aftalen med Novo Nordisk et vigtigt skridt i den fortsatte udvikling af EPI01 til behandling af seglcellean\u00e6mi, som er en livstruende, men desv\u00e6rre overset sygdom. Jeg f\u00f8ler mig overbevist om, at samarbejdet med Novo Nordisk, som har en lang historie bag sig med at udvikle og markedsf\u00f8re nye produkter til behandling af kroniske sygdomme over hele verden, vil v\u00e6re til gavn for de dedikerede patienter, l\u00e6ger og sygeplejersker, der deltager i vores kliniske studier,\" siger Santhosh Vadivelu, ph.d. og administrerende direkt\u00f8r for EpiDestiny. \"Med midlerne fra Novo Nordisk vil EpiDestiny f\u00e5 mulighed for at investere i og unders\u00f8ge det fulde potentiale af EPI01 indenfor onkologi samt videreudvikle andre l\u00e6gemiddelkandidater indenfor onkologi og andre indikationer.\" Seglcellean\u00e6mi (SCD)[3] er en af de mest almindelige arvelige sygdomme, som n\u00e6sten udelukkende forekommer i befolkningsgrupper med afrikanske og asiatiske r\u00f8dder[4]. Det sk\u00f8nnes, at der er omkring 30 mio. patienter globalt. SCD skyldes mutationer i genet for betak\u00e6den i det ilttransporterende h\u00e6moglobinmolekyle. Mutationerne resulterer i dannelsen af store fibriller i de r\u00f8de blodlegemer, hvilket bevirker, at de r\u00f8de blodlegemer bliver stive og deforme (antager seglform). Disse deforme blodlegemer klistrer sammen og kan blokere de sm\u00e5 blodkar, hvorved der opst\u00e5r kronisk blodmangel (an\u00e6mi) og v\u00e6vsskader, fordi ilten ikke n\u00e5r ud til de forskellige v\u00e6v og organer. Skade p\u00e5 organer som milten sv\u00e6kker patientens immunitet og medf\u00f8rer h\u00f8j risiko for infektioner som lungebet\u00e6ndelse. De store blodkar i hjernen kan blive p\u00e5virket af de stive r\u00f8de blodlegemer og blodmangel. Blandt b\u00f8rn med SCD vil ca. 10-15% f\u00e5 akut slagtilf\u00e6lde (apopleksi). Endnu flere vil f\u00e5 et eller flere uopdagede apoplektiske tilf\u00e6lde. Kronisk blodmangel p\u00e5virker desuden hjerte og lunger og bidrager til at forkorte livsl\u00e6ngden med mellem 25 og 30 \u00e5r, idet der findes meget begr\u00e6nsede medicinske behandlinger, der kan reducere \u00e5rsagen til sygdommen. Beta-talass\u00e6mi[5] er en besl\u00e6gtet gruppe af sygdomme i de r\u00f8de blodlegemer, som evolutionsm\u00e6ssigt ogs\u00e5 antages at h\u00e6nge sammen med malaria og ogs\u00e5 for\u00e5rsages af mutationer i genet for betaglobink\u00e6den. I stedet for at danne et muteret h\u00e6moglobinmolekyle dannes der ikke tilstr\u00e6kkeligt af h\u00e6moglobink\u00e6den, hvilket f\u00f8rer til forskellige grader af blodmangel og nedsat iltforsyning. I de mest alvorlige tilf\u00e6lde af beta-talass\u00e6mi, thalassaemia major, har patienterne behov for regelm\u00e6ssige blodtransfusioner. Selvom disse p\u00e5 kort sigt er livsn\u00f8dvendige, ophobes der p\u00e5 l\u00e6ngere sigt for meget jern i kroppen; dette p\u00e5virker hjertet, og patienterne risikerer for tidlig d\u00f8d. EPI01 er en oral formulering af to l\u00e6gemidler, decitabin og tetrahydrouridin, som potentielt kan virke ved at \u00f8ge m\u00e6ngden af f\u00f8talt h\u00e6moglobin. Det f\u00f8tale h\u00e6moglobin vil kunne erstatte det defekte h\u00e6moglobin hos SCD-patienter, s\u00e5 iltforsyningen til v\u00e6vet forbedres, samtidig med at de r\u00f8de blodlegemer i blodet ikke deformeres. EpiDestiny har af de amerikanske sundhedsmyndigheder (FDA) f\u00e5et tildelt Rare Pediatric Disease, Fast Track og Orphan Drug-status for EPI01. EpiDestiny er et privatejet biofarmaceutisk selskab med produkter i klinisk udvikling. Virksomhedens m\u00e5l er at tage hul p\u00e5 en ny \u00e6ra af behandling med oralt tilg\u00e6ngelige terapier, der fokuserer p\u00e5 genetisk kontrol i arvelige og erhvervede sygdomme s\u00e5som seglcellesygdom, beta-talass\u00e6mi og cancer.

The DEVOTE trial included 7,637 adults with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk and demonstrated non-inferiority of Tresiba\u00ae compared to insulin glargine U100 with regards to major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) with a hazard ratio of 0.91. MACE was defined as first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. As a pre-specified secondary end-point, treatment with Tresiba\u00ae resulted in 40% statistically significant lower rate of severe hypoglycaemia compared to insulin glargine U100. The glycaemic control between the two groups was similar at baseline and throughout the trial. The Tresiba\u00ae label was updated to reflect safety outcomes from the trial, the cardiovascular safety as well as the severe hypoglycaemia data. Furthermore, supplemental applications were submitted to the FDA in September 2016 for including data from the two SWITCH phase 3b trials in the label for Tresiba\u00ae. Following interactions with FDA, Novo Nordisk has withdrawn the applications related to the data from the SWITCH trials. \"It is well known that the fear of severe hypoglycaemia is a barrier to achieving good glycaemic control for many people with diabetes,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"We are therefore very pleased that the FDA has approved the updated label for Tresiba\u00ae as the only basal insulin to be labelled with a lower rate of severe hypoglycaemia compared to insulin glargine U100.\" The EU label for Tresiba\u00ae was updated in 2017 to reflect both the cardiovascular outcomes as well as the severe hypoglycaemia data of this long-acting basal insulin. About\u00a0DEVOTE DEVOTE\u00a0is a multinational, double-blinded clinical trial which investigated the cardiovascular safety of Tresiba\u00ae compared with insulin glargine U100 over 104 weeks. DEVOTE is the first cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) comparing two basal insulins and enrolled 7,637 people with type 2 diabetes. All participants were inadequately controlled with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and were already receiving standard of care to reduce their cardiovascular risk. The trial demonstrated that Tresiba\u00ae does not increase cardiovascular risk compared with insulin glargine U100, and provides a significant reduction in the rate of severe hypoglycaemia at similar levels of glycaemic control. About SWITCH 1 and 2 The two phase 3b, 2x32-weeks randomised, double-blind, cross-over, treat-to-target trials were initiated in January 2014 to compare the safety profile and efficacy of Tresiba\u00ae and insulin glargine U100. In the trials, adults were treated for a 16-week titration period followed by a 16-week maintenance period and subsequently switched to the comparator drug. The overall objective was to document the hypoglycaemia profile in type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, respectively. In SWITCH 1, 501 people with type 1 diabetes were randomised to cross-over treatment with Tresiba\u00ae and insulin glargine U100 in combination with insulin aspart. In SWITCH 2, 721 people with type 2 diabetes were randomised to cross-over treatment with Tresiba\u00ae and insulin glargine U100 in combination with oral antidiabetic drugs. About Tresiba\u00ae Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) is a once-daily basal insulin that provides a duration of action beyond 42 hours with a flat and stable glucose-lowering effect. It provides low variability in blood glucose levels and a lower risk of overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia vs insulin glargine U100. On occasions when administration at the same time of day is not possible, Tresiba\u00ae allows for flexibility in day-to-day dosing time with a minimum of eight hours between injections. Tresiba\u00ae received its first regulatory approval in September 2012 and has since been approved in more than 80 countries globally. Tresiba\u00ae was approved by the FDA on 26 September 2015 and it is now commercially available in more than 50 countries.

MACE var defineret som den f\u00f8rste forekomst af hjerte-kar-relateret d\u00f8dsfald, ikke-d\u00f8deligt myokardieinfarkt (hjerteanfald) eller ikke-d\u00f8deligt slagtilf\u00e6lde. Som et pr\u00e6specificeret sekund\u00e6rt endepunkt medf\u00f8rte behandling med Tresiba\u00ae en 40% statistisk signifikant lavere forekomst af alvorlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi (lavt blodsukker) sammenlignet med insulin glargin U100. Blodsukkerreguleringen i de to grupper var sammenlignelig ved studiets start og gennem hele studiet. Opdateringen af indl\u00e6gssedlen for Tresiba\u00ae sker med henblik p\u00e5 at afspejle de sikkerhedsrelaterede resultater fra studiet, herunder data for hjerte-kar-sikkerhed og alvorlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi. Novo Nordisk indsendte desuden supplerende ans\u00f8gninger til FDA i september 2016 om opdatering af indl\u00e6gssedlen for Tresiba\u00ae med data fra de to kliniske fase 3b-studier i SWITCH-programmet. Efter dialog med FDA har Novo Nordisk trukket ans\u00f8gningerne relateret til data fra SWITCH-studierne tilbage. \"Det er velkendt, at frygten for alvorlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi hos mange mennesker med diabetes er en barriere for at opn\u00e5 en god blodsukkerregulering,\" siger Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, koncerndirekt\u00f8r for forskning og udvikling i Novo Nordisk. \"Vi er derfor meget tilfredse med, at FDA har godkendt den opdaterede indl\u00e6gsseddel for Tresiba\u00ae som den eneste basalinsulin, hvor det fremg\u00e5r af indl\u00e6gssedlen, at det giver en lavere forekomst af alvorlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi sammenlignet med insulin glargin U100.\" I EU blev indl\u00e6gssedlen for Tresiba\u00ae opdateret i 2017, s\u00e5 den afspejler data for s\u00e5vel hjerte-kar-sygdom som for alvorlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi for denne langtidsvirkende basalinsulin. DEVOTE er et multinationalt, dobbeltblindet klinisk studie, som har unders\u00f8gt den kardiovaskul\u00e6re sikkerhed for Tresiba\u00ae sammenlignet med insulin glargin U100 i 104 uger. DEVOTE er det f\u00f8rste kardiovaskul\u00e6re sikkerhedsstudie, der har sammenlignet to basalinsuliner, og omfattede 7.637 mennesker med type 2-diabetes. Alle deltagere var utilstr\u00e6kkeligt reguleret med type 2-diabetes og \u00e5reforkalkningsbetinget hjerte-kar-sygdom og fik i forvejen standardbehandling for at reducere risikoen for hjerte-kar-h\u00e6ndelser. Studiet viste, at Tresiba\u00ae ikke \u00f8ger hjerte-kar-risikoen sammenlignet med insulin glargin U100, og at det medf\u00f8rer en signifikant reduktion i forekomsten af alvorlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi ved sammenlignelige niveauer af glyk\u00e6misk kontrol. De to 2x32-ugers randomiserede, dobbeltblindede, crossover-, treat to target- fase 3b-studier blev p\u00e5begyndt i januar 2014 med det form\u00e5l at sammenligne sikkerhedsprofilen og virkningen af Tresiba\u00ae og insulin glargin U100. I studierne blev voksne deltagere behandlet i en 16-ugers titreringsperiode efterfulgt af en 16-ugers vedligeholdelsesperiode, hvorefter de skiftede til den sammenlignende behandling. Det overordnede form\u00e5l var at dokumentere hypoglyk\u00e6miprofilen i henholdsvis type 1- og type 2-diabetes. I SWITCH 1 blev 501 deltagere med type 1-diabetes randomiseret til crossover-behandling med Tresiba\u00ae og insulin glargin U100 i kombination med insulin aspart. I SWITCH 2 blev 721 deltagere med type 2-diabetes randomiseret til crossover-behandling med Tresiba\u00ae og insulin glargin U100 i kombination med diabetesl\u00e6gemidler i tabletform. Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) er en basalinsulin til dosering \u00e9n gang dagligt med en virkningsvarighed p\u00e5 mere end 42 timer med en flad og stabil blodsukkers\u00e6nkende effekt. Tresiba\u00ae medf\u00f8rer en lav variation i blodsukkeret og en lavere risiko for generel, natlig og alvorlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi sammenlignet med insulin glargin U100. I situationer, hvor det ikke er muligt at tage insulin p\u00e5 det samme tidspunkt hver dag, giver Tresiba\u00ae mulighed for fleksibilitet med hensyn til injektionstidspunktet fra dag til dag, men med mindst otte timer mellem doserne. Tresiba\u00ae blev godkendt af registreringsmyndighederne f\u00f8rste gang i september 2012 og er siden blevet godkendt i flere end 80 lande verden over.

The submission is based on results from the pathfinder clinical trial programme. The pathfinder programme included more than 250 people with haemophilia A and investigated efficacy and safety of N8-GP in adults and children as well as people undergoing surgery. In the trial, adults treated prophylactically with N8-GP every fourth day experienced a median annualised bleeding rate of 1.3 episodes compared to 30.9 episodes for people treated on-demand. Paediatric participants experienced a median annualised bleeding rate of 1.95 episodes when administered twice weekly. In the surgery trial, all surgeries were effectively performed with N8-GP, and clinical efficacy evaluated by haemostatic response was reported as 'excellent' or 'good' in 43 out of the 45 performed surgeries. Across the pathfinder clinical trial programme, N8-GP demonstrated a safe and well-tolerated profile. \"We are excited to file the regulatory application for long-acting N8-GP in the US and EU,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"Based on the results from the global pathfinder clinical trial programme, we believe N8-GP can reduce the burden of treatment by decreasing the number of intravenous infusions while achieving the benefits in terms of efficacy and safety for people with haemophilia A.\" About N8-GP N8-GP (turoctocog alfa pegol) is a glycopegylated form of turoctocog alfa designed for prolonged half-life. The site specific glycopegylation is within the truncated B-domain. N8-GP is a B-domain modified form of turoctocog alfa and hence the active factor VIII generated by thrombin activation is identical to both activated endogenous FVIII and turoctocog alfa. About the pathfinder phase 3a clinical trial programmeThe pathfinder programme included more than 250 people with haemophilia A and investigated safety and efficacy of N8-GP, treatment of bleeds, prophylaxis and surgery, in adults as well as children. Pathfinder 2 was a global trial evaluating safety and efficacy of N8-GP, when administered for prophylaxis and on-demand treatment in people with haemophilia A, who are 12 years or older. 175 people were treated with a prophylactic regimen of 50 IU\/kg every fourth day, and 12 people received on-demand treatment. People were treated for up to 21 months, resulting in median annualised bleeding rates of 1.3 and 30.9 episodes for people treated prophylactically and on-demand, respectively. The pharmacokinetic data documented a single dose half-life of 18.4 hours and a mean trough level of 4% measured immediately before next dose for people on prophylaxis treatment. Pathfinder 3 was a surgery trial which was performed as an open-label, multi-national trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of N8-GP when administered for perioperative management in previously treated patients with severe haemophilia A who were 12 years or older. The trial included 33 people who underwent 45 major surgeries. People received a single preoperative dose of N8-GP, at a median of 51 IU\/kg. All surgeries were effectively performed with N8-GP, and clinical efficacy evaluated by haemostatic response was reported as 'excellent' or 'good' in 43 out of the 45 performed surgeries. N8-GP appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. Pathfinder 5 was a paediatric trial which was performed as a global trial evaluating safety and efficacy for N8-GP, when administered for prophylaxis in previously treated children with haemophilia A, who were between 0 to 11 years old. In the trial, 34 children 0-5 years of age and 34 children 6-11 years of age received prophylactic treatment and treatment of bleeding episodes. All children were treated with a regimen of 50-75 IU\/kg twice weekly for 26 weeks. Median annualised bleeding rates of 1.95 episodes were obtained in the trial. N8-GP appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile.

Oral semaglutide is a new GLP-1 analogue taken once daily as a tablet. The global 26-week trial investigated the efficacy and safety of 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide compared with placebo in 703 people with type 2 diabetes. Two distinct approaches to evaluating the effect of oral semaglutide were applied in the PIONEER 1 trial; a primary statistical principle[1] required by recent regulatory guidelines evaluating the effect regardless of treatment adherence and a secondary statistical principle[2] describing the effect if people had adhered to treatment and did not initiate rescue medication. The trial achieved its primary objective according to the primary statistical principle by demonstrating significant and superior improvements in HbA1c (long-term blood sugar) for all three doses of oral semaglutide compared to placebo. Moreover, the 14 mg dose of oral semaglutide demonstrated significant and superior weight loss versus placebo, weight loss was observed for the 7 mg and 3 mg doses but did not reach statistical significance. Applying the secondary statistical principle, people treated with 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide achieved reductions in HbA1c of 0.8%, 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively, compared to a reduction of 0.1% in people treated with placebo from a mean baseline of 8.0%. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) treatment target of HbA1c below 7.0% was achieved by 59%, 72% and 80% of people on treatment with 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide, respectively, compared to 34% of the people treated with placebo. In addition, from a mean baseline body weight of 88 kg and a BMI of 31.8 kg\/m2, people treated with 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide experienced a weight loss of 1.7 kg, 2.5 kg and 4.1 kg, respectively, compared to a weight loss of 1.5 kg in people treated with placebo. In the trial, oral semaglutide appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated clinical profile. The most common adverse event for all three oral semaglutide doses was mild to moderate nausea, which diminished over time. Between 5% and 16% of people treated with oral semaglutide experienced nausea, compared to 6% of people treated with placebo. Premature treatment discontinuation due to adverse events ranged from 2% to 7% for people treated with oral semaglutide, compared to 2% for people treated with placebo. \"We are very encouraged by the results of the PIONEER 1 trial, which confirm the unprecedented oral efficacy of semaglutide that was reported in the phase 2 clinical trial in type 2 diabetes,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"We look forward to providing data from the remaining nine PIONEER trials throughout this year and an expected regulatory submission in 2019.\" About PIONEER 1 and the PIONEER clinical programmePIONEER 1 was a 26-week, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, four-armed, parallel-group, multicentre, multinational trial comparing the efficacy and safety of three dose levels of once-daily oral semaglutide vs placebo in people with type 2 diabetes treated with diet and exercise only. 703 people were enrolled in PIONEER 1 and randomised 1:1:1:1 to receive either a dose of oral semaglutide (3, 7 or 14 mg) or placebo once daily. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline at week 26. The PIONEER phase 3a clinical development programme for oral semaglutide is a global development programme with an expected enrolment of more than 9,000 people with type 2 diabetes across 10 clinical trials, which all are expected to complete in 2018.

Oral semaglutid er en ny GLP-1-analog, der tages \u00e9n gang dagligt som en tablet. Det globale 26-ugers studie unders\u00f8gte effekten og sikkerheden af doser af oral semaglutid p\u00e5 3, 7 og 14 mg sammenlignet med placebo i 703 deltagere med type 2-diabetes. Der er i PIONEER 1-studiet anvendt to forskellige metoder til vurdering af effekten af oral semaglutid: et prim\u00e6rt statistisk princip[1], som kr\u00e6ves i henhold til nye regulatoriske retningslinjer, og som vurderer effekten uanset overholdelse af behandlingen, og et sekund\u00e6rt statistisk princip[2], der beskriver effekten ud fra en antagelse om, at deltagerne havde overholdt behandlingen og ikke iv\u00e6rksatte anden behandling. Studiet opfyldte sit prim\u00e6re m\u00e5l vurderet ud fra det prim\u00e6re statistiske princip, idet det viste v\u00e6sentlige og statistisk signifikante forbedringer i langtidsblodsukkeret (HbA1c) for alle tre doser af oral semaglutid sammenlignet med placebo. Endvidere medf\u00f8rte dosen p\u00e5 14 mg oral semaglutid et v\u00e6sentligt og statistisk signifikant v\u00e6gttab sammenlignet med placebo. V\u00e6gttab blev opn\u00e5et med doserne p\u00e5 7 mg og 3 mg, men var ikke statistisk signifikant. Vurderet ud fra det sekund\u00e6re statistiske princip opn\u00e5ede deltagere i behandling med 3, 7 og 14 mg oral semaglutid reduktioner i HbA1c p\u00e5 henholdsvis 0,8%, 1,3% og 1,5%, mod en reduktion p\u00e5 0,1% hos deltagere, der fik placebo, ud fra et gennemsnitligt udgangspunkt p\u00e5 8,0% ved studiets begyndelse. Behandlingsm\u00e5let om HbA1c p\u00e5 under 7,0% som fastsat af American Diabetes Association (ADA) blev n\u00e5et af 59%, 72% og 80% af deltagere i behandling med henholdsvis 3, 7 og 14 mg oral semaglutid, mod 34% af deltagere, der fik placebo. Ud fra en gennemsnitsv\u00e6gt p\u00e5 88 kg og et BMI p\u00e5 31,8 kg\/m2 ved studiets begyndelse opn\u00e5ede deltagere i behandling med 3, 7 og 14 mg oral semaglutid desuden et v\u00e6gttab p\u00e5 henholdsvis 1,7 kg, 2,5 kg og 4,1 kg, mod et v\u00e6gttab p\u00e5 1,5 kg hos deltagere, der fik placebo. Oral semaglutid forekom i studiet at have en sikker og veltolereret klinisk profil. Den mest almindelige bivirkning for alle tre doser var mild til moderat kvalme, som aftog med tiden. Mellem 5% og 16% af deltagere i behandling med oral semaglutid oplevede kvalme, mod 6% af deltagere, der fik placebo. Afslutning af behandlingen f\u00f8r tid som f\u00f8lge af bivirkninger var mellem 2% og 7% for deltagere, der blev behandlet med oral semaglutid, mod 2% for deltagere, der fik placebo. \"Vi er meget tilfredse med resultaterne af PIONEER 1-studiet, som bekr\u00e6fter den uovertrufne orale effekt af semaglutid, som vi s\u00e5 i fase 2-studiet indenfor type 2-diabetes,\" siger Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, koncerndirekt\u00f8r for forskning og udvikling i Novo Nordisk. \"Vi ser frem til at freml\u00e6gge data fra de resterende ni PIONEER-studier i l\u00f8bet af \u00e5ret og forventer at indsende registreringsans\u00f8gning i 2019.\" PIONEER 1 var et 26-ugers randomiseret, dobbeltblindet, placebokontrolleret, multicenter-, multinationalt parallelgruppestudie med fire behandlingsgrupper. Studiet unders\u00f8gte effekt og sikkerhed for tre dosisniveauer af oral semaglutid givet \u00e9n gang dagligt sammenlignet med placebo hos mennesker med type 2-diabetes, som blev behandlet med di\u00e6t og motion alene. PIONEER 1 omfattede 703 deltagere, som blev randomiseret 1:1:1:1 til at modtage enten en dosis oral semaglutid (3, 7 eller 14 mg) eller placebo \u00e9n gang dagligt. Det prim\u00e6re endepunkt var \u00e6ndring i langtidsblodsukkerniveauet (HbA1c) ved uge 26 i forhold til udgangspunktet ved studiets begyndelse. Det kliniske fase 3a-program for oral semaglutid, PIONEER, er et globalt udviklingsprogram med en forventet samlet deltagelse af mere end 9.000 mennesker med type 2-diabetes i 10 kliniske studier, som alle forventes afsluttet i 2018.

Ozempic\u00ae is a new once-weekly analogue of human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) indicated as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or is contraindicated, and as an addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes. The marketing authorisation applies to all 28 European Union member states. The label reflects the superior and sustained reductions in HbA1c and body weight achieved with Ozempic\u00ae relative to comparator treatments, cardiovascular benefits and the statistically significant reduction in diabetic nephropathy with Ozempic\u00ae relative to standard of care. Ozempic\u00ae has been approved in the EU for use in a multi-dose Ozempic\u00ae pen, the latest generation of Novo Nordisk prefilled devices. However, Novo Nordisk intends to submit a variation application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) seeking approval of an updated Ozempic\u00ae pen offering. The new pen offering will help facilitate reimbursement for patients with type 2 diabetes using Ozempic\u00ae. The launch of Ozempic\u00ae is expected to take place in the first EU countries in the second half of 2018 following the approval of the variation application for the updated pen offering. \"We are very excited about the approval of Ozempic\u00ae in the EU, as we believe it has the potential to set a new standard for the treatment of type 2 diabetes,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer. \"Type 2 diabetes is a complex disease and the strong clinical profile of Ozempic\u00ae provides a much needed treatment option for people looking for efficacious solutions to manage their disease.\" Ozempic\u00ae (semaglutide) is a new once-weekly analogue of human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) that has been developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The approval of Ozempic\u00ae is based on the SUSTAIN programme, a global clinical development programme that comprised eight phase 3a trials, encompassing more than 8,000 adults with type 2 diabetes. The phase 3a programme involved a broad range of people with type 2 diabetes, including some with high cardiovascular risk profiles and people with and without renal disease. Ozempic\u00ae was approved by the US FDA on 5 December 2017 and by Health Canada on 9 January 2018.

Ozempic\u00ae er en ny ugentlig analog af det naturlige hormon glukagonlignende peptid-1 (GLP-1), som er godkendt til monoterapi, n\u00e5r metformin anses for uhensigtsm\u00e6ssig p\u00e5 grund af intolerans eller kontraindikationer, samt som till\u00e6gsbehandling til andre l\u00e6gemidler til behandling af diabetes. Markedsf\u00f8ringstilladelsen g\u00e6lder samtlige 28 EU-medlemslande. Indl\u00e6gssedlen afspejler de statistisk signifikante og varige reduktioner i langtidsblodsukker (HbA1c) og v\u00e6gt, der opn\u00e5s ved behandling med Ozempic\u00ae i forhold til sammenlignende behandlinger, samt hjerte-kar-fordelene og den statistisk signifikante reduktion i diabetisk nyresygdom ved behandling med Ozempic\u00ae sammenlignet med standardbehandling. Ozempic\u00ae er godkendt i EU til brug i \u00e9n multidosispen, Ozempic\u00ae pen, som er Novo Nordisks nyeste generation af pr\u00e6fyldte injektionspenne. Novo Nordisk agter at indsende en variationsans\u00f8gning til Det Europ\u00e6iske L\u00e6gemiddelagentur (EMA) om godkendelse af et opdateret Ozempic\u00ae penudvalg. Det nye penudvalg vil g\u00f8re det nemmere at opn\u00e5 tilskud for mennesker med type 2-diabetes, der bruger Ozempic\u00ae. Lanceringen af Ozempic\u00ae forventes at finde sted i de f\u00f8rste EU-lande i andet halv\u00e5r af 2018 efter godkendelsen af variationsans\u00f8gningen for det opdaterede penudvalg. \"Vi er meget tilfredse med godkendelsen af Ozempic\u00ae i EU, da vi er overbevist om, at det har potentiale til at s\u00e6tte en ny standard for behandling af type 2-diabetes,\" siger Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, koncerndirekt\u00f8r for forskning og udvikling i Novo Nordisk. \"Type 2-diabetes er en kompleks sygdom, og Ozempic\u00ae med sin st\u00e6rke kliniske profil giver en h\u00e5rdt tiltr\u00e6ngt behandlingsmulighed for mennesker med diabetes, der er p\u00e5 udkig efter virkningsfulde l\u00f8sninger til at regulere deres sygdom.\" Ozempic\u00ae (semaglutid) er en ny ugentlig analog af det naturlige hormon glukagonlignende peptid-1 (GLP-1), som er udviklet til behandling af type 2-diabetes.

Fase 3a-programmet omfattede en bred vifte af deltagere med type 2-diabetes, herunder deltagere med h\u00f8j risiko for hjerte-kar-sygdom samt deltagere med og uden nyresygdom.

Sales within biopharmaceuticals declined by 18% to DKK 18.8 billion (16% in local currencies), reflecting the impact in the USA from the introduction of a generic version of the hormone replacement therapy product Vagifem\u00ae and a rebate adjustment for growth hormone in Q1 2016. Sales within haemophilia were broadly unchanged (2% growth in local currencies). Sales within International Operations increased by 2% in Danish kroner (5% in local currencies) driven by sales growth in all business regions measured in local currencies. Sales within North America Operations decreased by 2% in Danish kroner and were unchanged in local currencies, reflecting the non-recurring effects in biopharmaceuticals impacting growth negatively by 4 percentage points. Operating profit increased by 1% reported in Danish kroner and by 5% in local currencies to DKK 49.0 billion. Net profit increased by 1% to DKK 38.1 billion. Diluted earnings per share increased by 3% to DKK 15.39. In December, Novo Nordisk received the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Ozempic\u00ae (semaglutide) for treatment of people with type 2 diabetes and a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) under the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommending marketing authorisation for Ozempic\u00ae. Ozempic\u00ae will be launched in the USA next week. Chairman of the Board of Directors G\u00f6ran Ando has decided not to seek re-election at the Annual General Meeting in March 2018. The Board of Directors proposes current member of the Board of Directors Helge Lund to be elected as chairman of the Board of Directors. As per 15 February 2018, Karsten Munk Knudsen, currently senior vice president of Corporate Finance, will succeed Jesper Brandgaard as chief financial officer. Jesper Brandgaard will continue as executive vice president responsible for Biopharm and Legal Affairs. For 2018, sales growth is expected to be 2-5% measured in local currencies and operating profit growth is expected to be 1-5%. Sales growth reported in Danish kroner is expected to be 7 percentage points lower than in local currencies, reflecting the significant depreciation of the US dollar and related currencies versus the Danish krone. Likewise, reported operating profit growth is expected to be 10 percentage points lower. At the Annual General Meeting on 22 March 2018, the Board of Directors will propose a final dividend of DKK 4.85 for 2017 per share of DKK 0.20. The expected total dividend for 2017 of DKK 7.85 per share, of which DKK 3.00 per share was paid as interim dividend in August 2017, corresponds to an increase of 3% compared to 2016. The Board of Directors furthermore intends to initiate a new 12-month share repurchase programme of up to DKK 14 billion.

This proposal implies a total equity valuation of approximately EUR\u00a02.6 billion1 for Ablynx and represents a premium of up to 60% over Ablynx's share price as of 6 December 2017 of \u20ac19.12, which was the day prior to our first proposal, and up to 66% over Ablynx's 3 month VWAP of EUR\u00a018.39 as of 5 January 2018. Novo Nordisk has made a concerted and good faith effort to engage in discussions with Ablynx. This proposal is the second proposal that Novo Nordisk has made to Ablynx's Board of Directors and represents up to approximately a 14% increase over the first proposal. Novo Nordisk regrets that the Board of Directors of Ablynx has so far declined to engage in any discussions, despite the proposals which have been put forward. Novo Nordisk has conducted a deep analysis of Ablynx's business and product portfolio, based on publicly available information, including caplacizumab, ALX-0171, vobarilizumab, its other pipeline products and partnerships. Following that analysis, Novo Nordisk has concluded that combining Ablynx's caplacizumab with Novo Nordisk's strong global haematology franchise and extensive worldwide resources is a compelling opportunity and provides the clearest path to realizing full potential of Ablynx's portfolio in the best interests of all stakeholders, including patients and physicians. The proposed transaction would combine Novo Nordisk's regulatory, scientific and commercial expertise with Ablynx's strong existing medical teams to optimise the development and global commercialisation of caplacizumab. Novo Nordisk has a high regard for Ablynx's other pipeline assets and the Nanobody platform. Novo Nordisk has since 2015 been undertaking a research collaboration with Ablynx on the Nanobody platform. Novo Nordisk would plan to continue to invest in the platform and support its people and activities, including the existing partnerships Ablynx has in place. We firmly believe that the combination of Ablynx's pipeline, R&D team and antibody engineering platform with Novo Nordisk's own R&D organization would create a stronger combined research base. Novo Nordisk recognises the value of maintaining Ablynx's presence in the Ghent area and intends to keep Ablynx's strong R&D base within Ghent and further develop Ablynx as a centre of excellence in Nanobody discovery and engineering. On 7 December 2017, Novo Nordisk made an initial non-binding proposal to acquire Ablynx for EUR\u00a026.75 per share in cash. This proposal was rejected by Ablynx's Board of Directors on 14 December 2017. Following this, Novo Nordisk has made a number of attempts to engage in a dialogue with Ablynx, which were rejected by Ablynx's Board of Directors. On 22 December 2017, Novo Nordisk submitted a revised non-binding proposal to acquire Ablynx for up to EUR\u00a030.50 per share, including EUR\u00a028.00 per share in cash and one CVR with total potential cash payments over time of up to EUR\u00a02.50 per share. This proposal was rejected by Ablynx's Board of Directors on 23 December 2017. The Board of Directors of Ablynx has declined to engage in any discussions which would allow Novo Nordisk to better understand Ablynx management's views on Ablynx's prospects and valuation of Ablynx. Following this, Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen, chief executive efficer of Novo Nordisk, spoke to Edwin Moses, chief executive officer of Ablynx on 5 January 2018 to reiterate Novo Nordisk's commitment to the transaction and to encourage Ablynx to meet with Novo Nordisk in order to have a discussion around key value drivers. Unfortunately, this offer was again refused by the Board of Directors of Ablynx. Novo Nordisk's non-binding proposal submitted on 22 December 2017 consists of an upfront cash consideration of EUR\u00a028.00 per share and one CVR with total potential cash payments over time of up to EUR\u00a02.50 per share. Each CVR would entitle Ablynx's shareholders to receive additional cash payments promptly upon the occurrence of the following events: \"The proposed transaction with Ablynx represents a compelling opportunity for both companies and is in the best interests of all of Ablynx's stakeholders\", said Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen, chief executive officer of Novo Nordisk. \"Novo Nordisk and Ablynx share a common focus on innovation-driven, patient-centric R&D. Novo Nordisk intends to use its full suite of regulatory, scientific and marketing expertise to complement the existing strong management and medical team at Ablynx in order to optimise the development and global commercialisation of caplacizumab for the benefit of patients suffering from aTTP. The proposed transaction is attractive for Novo Nordisk and is in line with Novo Nordisk's stated strategy to invest in its Biopharm operations. Ahead of the rapidly approaching potential EMA approval of caplacizumab, we believe now is the right time to consider a transaction that maximizes value for all of Ablynx's stakeholders.\" At this stage, there can be no assurance that any agreement with respect to the proposed transaction will be reached between the two companies. Novo Nordisk's proposal to Ablynx's Board of Directors is subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence and the negotiation, execution and delivery of a mutually acceptable definitive transaction agreement.

P\u00e5 baggrund af denne analyse har Novo Nordisk konkluderet, at en sammenl\u00e6gning af Ablynx' caplacizumab med Novo Nordisks st\u00e6rke globale h\u00e6matologiforretning og omfattende globale ressourcer er en oplagt mulighed og den klareste vej til at realisere det fulde potentiale af Ablynx' portef\u00f8lje til fordel for alle interessenter, herunder patienter og l\u00e6ger. Den foresl\u00e5ede transaktion vil kombinere Novo Nordisks regulatoriske, videnskabelige og salgsm\u00e6ssige ekspertise med Ablynx' st\u00e6rke eksisterende medicinske teams for at optimere udviklingen og den globale kommercialisering af caplacizumab. Novo Nordisk n\u00e6rer stor agtelse for de \u00f8vrige aktiver i Ablynx' pipeline samt virksomhedens Nanobody-platform. Novo Nordisk har siden 2015 haft et forskningssamarbejde med Ablynx om Nanobody-platformen. Novo Nordisk p\u00e5t\u00e6nker fortsat at investere i platformen og supportere de dertil knyttede medarbejdere og aktiviteter, herunder de eksisterende partnerskaber, som Ablynx har etableret. Vi er overbevist om, at Ablynx' pipeline, forsknings- og udviklingsteam samt antistofteknologiplatform kombineret med Novo Nordisks egen forsknings- og udviklingsorganisation ville skabe et st\u00e6rkere f\u00e6lles forskningsgrundlag. Novo Nordisk anerkender v\u00e6rdien af at fastholde Ablynx' tilstedev\u00e6relse i Ghent-omr\u00e5det og vil s\u00e5ledes fastholde Ablynx' st\u00e6rke forsknings- og udviklingsbase i Ghent og yderligere udvikle Ablynx som et kompetencecenter for opdagelse og udvikling af antistoffer ved hj\u00e6lp af Nanobody-platformen. Den 7. december 2017 fremlagde Novo Nordisk et indledende ikke-bindende forslag om at erhverve Ablynx for \u20ac26,75 pr. aktie kontant. Dette forslag blev afvist af Ablynx' bestyrelse den 14. december 2017. Herefter har Novo Nordisk gjort flere fors\u00f8g p\u00e5 at komme i dialog med Ablynx, men disse er blevet afvist af Ablynx' bestyrelse. Den 22. december 2017 fremlagde Novo Nordisk et revideret ikke-bindende forslag om at erhverve Ablynx for op til 30,50 EUR pr. aktie, herunder 28,00 EUR pr. aktie kontant og en betinget vederlagsrettighed (CVR) med samlede kontante betalinger over tid p\u00e5 potentielt op til 2,50 EUR pr. aktie. Dette forslag blev afvist af Ablynx' bestyrelse den 23. december 2017. Ablynx' bestyrelse har afvist at deltage i enhver dr\u00f8ftelse, som ville kunne give Novo Nordisk mulighed for bedre at forst\u00e5 Ablynx' ledelses syn p\u00e5 Ablynx' fremtidsudsigter samt v\u00e6rdians\u00e6ttelsen af Ablynx. Herefter talte Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen, Novo Nordisks administrerende direkt\u00f8r, med Edwin Moses, Ablynx' administrerende direkt\u00f8r, den 5. januar 2018 for at gentage Novo Nordisks engagement i transaktionen og opfordre Ablynx til at m\u00f8des med Novo Nordisk for at dr\u00f8fte virksomhedens centrale v\u00e6rdiskabende aktiviteter. Desv\u00e6rre blev dette tilbud igen afvist af Ablynx' bestyrelse. Novo Nordisks ikke-bindende forslag af 22. december 2017 best\u00e5r af en kontant betaling ved overtagelsen p\u00e5 28,00 EUR pr. aktie og en betinget vederlagsrettighed (CVR) med samlede kontante betalinger over tid p\u00e5 potentielt op til 2,50 EUR pr. aktie. Hver betinget vederlagsrettighed (CVR) ville give Ablynx' aktion\u00e6rer ret til at modtage yderligere kontante betalinger i tilf\u00e6lde af f\u00f8lgende situationer: \"Den foresl\u00e5ede transaktion med Ablynx er en oplagt mulighed for begge virksomheder og vil v\u00e6re til fordel for alle Ablynx' interessenter,\" siger Novo Nordisks administrerende direkt\u00f8r, Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen. \"Novo Nordisk og Ablynx har et f\u00e6lles fokus p\u00e5 innovationsdrevet forskning og udvikling med patienten i centrum. Novo Nordisk \u00f8nsker at s\u00e6tte al sin regulatoriske, videnskabelige og salgsm\u00e6ssige ekspertise ind p\u00e5 at komplementere Ablynx' st\u00e6rke ledelse og medicinske team med det m\u00e5l at optimere udviklingen og den globale kommercialisering af caplacizumab til gavn for patienter med aTTP. Den foresl\u00e5ede transaktion er attraktiv for Novo Nordisk og er i tr\u00e5d med Novo Nordisks erkl\u00e6rede strategi om at investere i virksomhedens aktiviteter indenfor det biofarmaceutiske omr\u00e5de. I lyset af den snarligt forest\u00e5ende potentielle EMA-godkendelse af caplacizumab mener vi, at tiden nu er moden til at overveje en transaktion, der maksimerer v\u00e6rdien for alle Ablynx' interessenter.\" Der kan p\u00e5 nuv\u00e6rende tidspunkt ikke gives nogen sikkerhed for, at de to virksomheder vil n\u00e5 til en aftale om den foresl\u00e5ede transaktion. Novo Nordisks forslag til Ablynx' bestyrelse er betinget af en tilfredsstillende due diligence-unders\u00f8gelse samt forhandling, eksekvering og levering af en gensidigt acceptabel endelig transaktionsaftale. Novo Nordisk opfordrer Ablynx' bestyrelse til at tage del i en forhandlet transaktion til fordel for alle interessenter.

The CHMP recommends Ozempic\u00ae, the intended brand name for once-weekly semaglutide, to be indicated as monotherapy when metformin no longer provides sufficient treatment or is contraindicated and as an addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes. The indication also refers to specific sections of the label for study results with respect to combination with other diabetes medications, effects on glycaemic control, cardiovascular events and the populations studied. The label furthermore reflects the superior reduction in body weight achieved with Ozempic\u00ae relative to comparator treatments and the statistically significant reduction in diabetic nephropathy with Ozempic\u00ae relative to standard of care. As an integral part of the approval, Novo Nordisk has committed to conduct post-approval safety studies including a long-term diabetic retinopathy outcome study. Furthermore, as required for all long-acting GLP-1 products approved in the EU, Ozempic\u00ae will be enrolled in the data collection for the registry of medullary thyroid carcinoma. \"We are very excited about the positive opinion for Ozempic\u00ae for treatment of people with type 2 diabetes in Europe, many of whom are still looking for new and more efficacious solutions to better manage their disease,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer. \"We believe Ozempic\u00ae, with its unique clinical profile, has the potential to set a new standard for treatment of type 2 diabetes.\" Novo Nordisk expects to receive final marketing authorisation from the European Commission in the first quarter of 2018.

Hypoglycaemia can cause a range of symptoms including confusion, trembling, sweating, increased heart rate, difficulty with concentration and\/or speech and in severe cases can lead to a seizure or coma.4-6 Severe hypoglycaemia can cause extensive damage to the body and is significantly associated with cardiovascular death.7 Every month, 46.5% of people with type 2 diabetes and 83.0% of people with type 1 diabetes experience a hypoglycaemic episode.8 About the new analysesThe analyses, based on the recent SWITCH trials, separated people into two groups depending on whether they had achieved target blood sugar levels (defined as HbA1c of 7.0% or less) during the maintenance period of the trial.1 Target blood sugar levels are those recommended by the joint guidelines of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes.9 About SWITCH 1 and 2SWITCH 1 and SWITCH 2 were two phase 3b, 64-week, double-blind, randomised, treat-to-target, 2-period crossover trials that investigated the hypoglycaemia profile of Tresiba\u00ae compared with insulin glargine U100 in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. The trial design included a titration period in which the doses of study treatments (Tresiba\u00ae or insulin degludec U100) were gradually increased over a 16 week period, followed by a 16 week maintenance period during which a constant dose of study treatment was maintained.2,3 The primary endpoint was the number of severe or blood glucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes observed in participants during the maintenance period.2,3 Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) is a once-daily basal insulin that provides a duration of action beyond 42 hours with a flat and stable glucose-lowering effect.10,11 It has been shown to provide a lower risk of overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia, and low variability in blood glucose levels versus insulin glargine U100.11,12 Tresiba\u00ae received its first regulatory approval in September 2012 and has since been approved in more than 80 countries globally. It is now commercially available in more than 50 countries. Further information References1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gumprecht J, Lane W, Chaykin LB, et al.

The trial results were presented today at the International Diabetes Federation Congress 2017 (IDF 2017).1 \"Millions of people with type 2 diabetes participate in Ramadan every year and we know that periods of prolonged fasting can increase the risk of hypoglycaemia,\" said lead investigator Dr Mohamed Hassanein of the Dubai Hospital, Dubai Health Authority, UAE and chair of the Diabetes and Ramadan International Alliance (DAR). \"This highlights the importance of people with type 2 diabetes preparing for Ramadan with their doctor and discussing treatment options for preventing episodes of hypoglycaemia.\" It is estimated that worldwide over 116 million Muslims with diabetes may choose to fast during Ramadan.2 Muslims with type 2 diabetes who fast during Ramadan have up to a 7.5-fold increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia.3 \"This trial has shown that Ryzodeg\u00ae is not only a simple treatment option which can make daily life easier for people with diabetes. Ryzodeg\u00ae also reduces the risk of potentially dangerous episodes of hypoglycaemia in people with type 2 diabetes who choose to fast during Ramadan,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. The trial was designed to investigate the effects of Ryzodeg\u00ae on blood sugar control and hypoglycaemia reduction versus BIAsp 30, both at the end of Ramadan and 4 weeks post-Ramadan. There was no difference in overall blood sugar control between Ryzodeg\u00ae\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and BIAsp 30.1 The Ramadan trial compared the efficacy and safety of Ryzodeg\u00ae twice daily and BIAsp 30 (NovoMix\u00ae) twice daily in subjects with type 2 diabetes before, during and after Ramadan. The trial was a 28-week, international, open-label, randomised, treat-to-target trial involving 263 adults from five countries with large Muslim populations (Algeria, India, Lebanon, Malaysia and South Africa). The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to the end of the month of Ramadan (four-week period). Secondary confirmatory endpoints included rates of blood sugar confirmed, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia.1 Ryzodeg\u00ae is a combination of two distinct insulin analogues (insulin degludec and insulin aspart in the ratio of 70% and 30%), making it the first combination of a basal insulin with an ultra-long duration of action and a mealtime insulin in one pen for people with type 1 and 2 diabetes.4-6 Ryzodeg\u00ae incorporates the benefits of the degludec molecule.7,8 Ryzodeg\u00ae is given as an injection once or twice daily with the main meal(s).4 Ryzodeg\u00ae offers a simpler regimen with fewer injections than basal and bolus therapy, in one pen.9 Ryzodeg\u00ae received its first regulatory approval in December 2012 and European Medicines Agency approval in January 2013. Since then, Ryzodeg\u00ae has been approved in more than 70 countries, including the US in September 2015. It is now commercially available in 13 countries.4 Further information References1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hassanein M, Echtay A, Malek R, et al.

Ny forskning viser, at Ryzodeg\u00ae (insulin degludec\/insulin aspart) reducerer den generelle forekomst af lavt blodsukker (hypoglyk\u00e6mi), herunder alvorlige tilf\u00e6lde, med 62% og forekomsten af natlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi med 74% sammenlignet med bifasisk insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30 [NovoMix\u00ae 30]). Disse resultater pr\u00e6senteres i dag p\u00e5 International Diabetes Federation Congress 2017 (IDF 2017).1 \"Hvert \u00e5r deltager millioner af mennesker med type 2-diabetes i ramadanen, og vi ved, at l\u00e6ngere fasteperioder kan \u00f8ge risikoen for hypoglyk\u00e6mi,\" siger dr. Mohamed Hassanein fra Dubai Hospital, Dubai Health Authority, Forenede Arabiske Emirater, fors\u00f8gsansvarlig l\u00e6ge i studiet og formand for Diabetes and Ramadan International Alliance (DAR). \"Dette bekr\u00e6fter, hvor vigtigt det er, at mennesker med type 2-diabetes, i samarbejde med deres l\u00e6ge, forbereder sig til ramadanen og bliver enige om, hvilke justeringer af deres behandling der er n\u00f8dvendige for at forebygge hypoglyk\u00e6mi.\" Man ansl\u00e5r, at der er over 116 mio. muslimer med diabetes i verden, som muligvis faster under ramadanen.2 Muslimer med type 2-diabetes, som faster under ramadanen, har op til 7,5 gange for\u00f8get risiko for alvorlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi.3 \"Dette studie har vist, at Ryzodeg\u00ae ikke bare er en enkel behandlingsmulighed, som kan g\u00f8re hverdagen lettere for mennesker med diabetes.

Studiet blev gennemf\u00f8rt som et 28-ugers, internationalt, ikke-blindet, randomiseret treat to target-studie, som omfattede 263 voksne fra fem lande med store muslimske befolkningsgrupper (Algeriet, Indien, Libanon, Malaysia og Sydafrika). Det prim\u00e6re endepunkt var \u00e6ndring i langtidsblodsukker (HbA1c) fra baseline ved studiets start til afslutningen af ramadanm\u00e5neden (fire uger). De sekund\u00e6re bekr\u00e6ftende endepunkter var bl.a. forekomsten af natlig og alvorlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi bekr\u00e6ftet ved blodsukkerm\u00e5ling.1 Ryzodeg\u00ae er en kombination af to forskellige insulinanaloger (insulin degludec og insulin aspart i forholdet 70\/30) og dermed den f\u00f8rste kombination af en ultralangtidsvirkende basalinsulin og en m\u00e5ltidsinsulin i \u00e9n injektionspen til mennesker med type 1- og type 2-diabetes.4-6 Ryzodeg\u00ae indeholder degludec-molekylets fordele.7,8 Ryzodeg\u00ae gives som injektion \u00e9n eller to gange dagligt sammen med et hovedm\u00e5ltid.4 Ryzodeg\u00ae giver mulighed for en enklere behandling med f\u00e6rre injektioner end ved basal-bolusbehandling, i \u00e9n pen.9 Ryzodeg\u00ae modtog sin f\u00f8rste myndighedsgodkendelse i december 2012 og blev godkendt af Det Europ\u00e6iske L\u00e6gemiddelagentur i januar 2013.

The global survey - Taking Diabetes to Heart - developed in partnership with Novo Nordisk, runs until March 2018 and is open to all people with type 2 diabetes. Diabetes currently affects 425 million adults worldwide1, with most cases being type 2 diabetes. Cardiovascular disease, which includes stroke, coronary heart disease and peripheral artery disease3, is the leading cause of disability and death in people with type 2 diabetes1,4. To date, 943 responses to the survey have been received from 32 countries and interim findings show that: \"The interim results of Taking Diabetes to Heart reiterate the importance of raising awareness of the association between type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease to promote prevention, timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment to help reduce the current burden that the two conditions represent,\" said Dr Shaukat Sadikot, outgoing IDF President. \"With the world facing an increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, better understanding the link between these conditions is needed more than ever.\" Taking Diabetes to Heart - www.idf.org\/takingdiabetes2heart\/survey - aims to gather insights on current gaps in education and CVD risk behaviour among people with type 2 diabetes, and to put in place advocacy and patient support strategies and tactics to improve health and wellbeing among populations. \"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of disability and death among people living with type 2 diabetes. Too few individuals with diabetes are being informed by healthcare professionals of their cardiovascular risk and the impact that risk may have on their longevity and quality of life,\" said Alan Moses, senior vice president and chief medical officer of Novo Nordisk. \"We encourage more people in the diabetes community to complete the Taking Diabetes to Heart survey to strengthen the global findings that will inform future efforts to help improve outcomes.\" The results of Taking Diabetes to Heart will serve to define the actions that are required to improve the health outcomes of people with type 2 diabetes. The initiative will culminate in a comprehensive report with country-specific results and resources to help support knowledge and awareness of CVD among people with type 2 diabetes around the world.

Ozempic\u00ae is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Ozempic\u00ae, the approved brand name for once-weekly semaglutide in the US, is a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. The approval of Ozempic\u00ae is based on the results from the SUSTAIN clinical trial programme and follows a positive recommendation from an FDA Advisory Committee meeting on 18 October 2017. In people with type 2 diabetes, Ozempic\u00ae produced clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions in HbA1c compared with placebo, sitagliptin, exenatide extended-release and insulin glargine U100. Furthermore, in the trials, treatment with Ozempic\u00ae resulted in statistically significant reductions in body weight. Ozempic\u00ae demonstrated a safe and well-tolerated profile across the SUSTAIN programme with the most common adverse event being mild to moderate nausea, which diminished over time. Ozempic\u00ae is approved for use in two therapeutic dosages, 0.5 mg and 1 mg, and will be launched in the Ozempic\u00ae Pen, the latest generation of Novo Nordisk prefilled devices. Novo Nordisk will, as part of the post-approval requirements, conduct a paediatric trial in adolescents under 18 years of age and will add Ozempic\u00ae to the 15-year MTC (medullary thyroid carcinoma) registry that is being conducted for all other long-acting GLP-1 products. \"We are very excited about the first approval of Ozempic\u00ae and look forward to making this important innovation available to people in the US with type 2 diabetes in the beginning of 2018,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer. \"Type 2 diabetes is a complex disease, but with the unique clinical profile of Ozempic\u00ae, we believe it has the potential to set a new standard for the treatment of the disease.\" Conference call On 6 December 2017 at 12.00 pm CET, corresponding to 6.00 am EST, a conference call for investors will be held.

This was reported by people with type 2 diabetes whose blood sugar was not controlled on insulin glargine U100 with metformin, and who completed quality-of-life questionnaires as part of the DUAL VII clinical trial.1 In addition, more people preferred to stay on Xultophy\u00ae compared with basal-bolus therapy (84.5% versus 68.1%).1 These results were presented today at the 2017 International Diabetes Federation Congress in Abu Dhabi, UAE. \"Adding insulin injections at mealtime is an effective option to achieve desired blood glucose levels when basal insulin is not enough, but this raises the level of complexity in the patients' daily management of their diabetes. It can also lead to an increased risk of hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or weight gain\", said Professor Esteban J\u00f3dar, University Hospital Quir\u00f3n Salud, Madrid, Spain. \"In the main analysis of the DUAL VII trial, Xultophy\u00ae delivered similar glucose reductions to a basal-bolus regimen alongside weight loss, as opposed to weight gain, and fewer episodes of hypoglycaemia. We now see that it also reduces treatment burden.\" In the patient-reported outcomes (PRO) analysis from the DUAL VII clinical trial, 506 adults living with type 2 diabetes assessed their physical health, mental health and a number of diabetes-specific factors. These scores were measured using the validated Treatment-Related Impact Measure-Diabetes (TRIM-D) questionnaire and the Short Form Health Survey 36 v2 (SF-36)1. The participants in the study treated with Xultophy\u00ae reported better experiences for all diabetes-specific factors compared to the ones in the basal-bolus treatment regimen, with the highest improvement in TRIM-D scores given for diabetes management (16.7 versus 6.8), treatment burden (12.4 versus 4.3) and compliance (9.1 versus 3.9). The analysis of the SF-36 questionnaire results found that Xultophy\u00ae was associated with a statistically significant higher score compared to basal-bolus insulin regimen for the mental health component of the questionnaire; all other comparisons were non-significant.1 \"Living with diabetes is a complex situation in itself, and the treatment should not add to this. We are very pleased to see that Xultophy\u00ae not only helps people with type 2 diabetes reach their blood glucose targets while reducing the risk of hypoglycaemia and helping them to lose weight, but does this in a simple way\", said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"This is a key component of what innovation in diabetes means to us. It's about making the lives of people with diabetes as easy as possible.\" This analysis is based on PRO data collected during the DUAL VII clinical trial using different health questionnaires. The TRIM-D questionnaire is specific to diabetes. The SF-36 is a generic health questionnaire used to assess quality of life measures. Motivation to stay on treatment was measured using an additional motivation questionnaire.1 In DUAL VII, Xultophy\u00ae induced greater improvements in PROs, mainly in outcome measures related to diabetes management, treatment burden and compliance versus basal-bolus therapy in people with HbA1c 7.0-10% switched from insulin glargine U100 with metformin. People on Xultophy\u00ae had an equal reduction in HbA1c, a lower rate of hypoglycaemia, fewer injections per day and weight loss versus basal-bolus insulin treatment. Improvement in the PRO measurements with Xultophy\u00ae corresponded with desirable clinical outcomes. The open-label nature of the trial was a limitation and could have influenced the results.1 Changes in PRO scores were calculated from baseline after 26 weeks of treatment. Per definition, PRO data came directly from patients, without interpretation of the patient's response by a clinician or anyone else.2 DUAL VII was a phase 3b, 26-week, randomised, open-label, multicentre trial conducted in 12 countries including 506 patients.3 The trial was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of Xultophy\u00ae versus basal-bolus therapy in adults with type 2 diabetes previously treated with insulin glargine U100 and metformin.3 Xultophy\u00ae is a once-daily single injection fixed-ratio combination of long-acting insulin degludec and the glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1) receptor agonist liraglutide in one pen. It is indicated for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control in combination with oral glucose-lowering medicinal products when these alone or combined with a GLP-1 receptor agonist or basal insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic control. Xultophy\u00ae can be administered at any time of the day with or without meals, preferably at the same time of the day.4 References 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jodar E, Doshi A, Gouet D, et al.

Det viser en unders\u00f8gelse blandt deltagere med type 2-diabetes, som var utilfredsstillende reguleret med insulin glargin U100 plus metformin, og som besvarede sp\u00f8rgeskemaer om livskvalitet som led i det kliniske studie DUAL VII.1 Der var desuden flere, der foretrak at forts\u00e6tte med behandling med Xultophy\u00ae end med basal-bolus-behandling (84,5% mod 68,1%).1 Disse resultater pr\u00e6senteres i dag p\u00e5 International Diabetes Federation Congress 2017 (IDF 2017) i Abu Dhabi, Forenede Arabiske Emirater. \"N\u00e5r man ikke l\u00e6ngere opn\u00e5r en tilstr\u00e6kkelig blodsukkerregulering med basalinsulin, er det en virkningsfuld mulighed at supplere med injektioner af m\u00e5ltidsinsulin, men det \u00f8ger kompleksiteten i den daglige behandling for patienten. Det kan ogs\u00e5 give st\u00f8rre risiko for at f\u00e5 for lavt blodsukker (hypoglyk\u00e6mi) eller tage p\u00e5 i v\u00e6gt,\" siger professor Esteban J\u00f3dar, University Hospital Quir\u00f3n Salud, Madrid, Spanien. \"Hovedanalysen af DUAL VII-studiet viste, at Xultophy\u00ae medf\u00f8rte blodsukkerreduktioner svarende til basal-bolus-behandling og samtidig gav v\u00e6gttab i stedet for v\u00e6gt\u00f8gning samt f\u00e6rre tilf\u00e6lde af lavt blodsukker. Vi ser nu, at det ogs\u00e5 reducerer den belastning, behandlingen udg\u00f8r for patienterne.\" I analysen af de patientrapporterede behandlingsresultater fra DUAL VII-studiet vurderede 506 voksne med type 2-diabetes deres fysiske og psykiske sundhed samt en r\u00e6kke diabetesspecifikke parametre. Scorerne blev beregnet ved hj\u00e6lp af sp\u00f8rgeskemaerne Treatment-Related Impact Measure-Diabetes (TRIM-D) og Short Form Health Survey 36 v2 (SF-36).1 De af studiets deltagere, der blev behandlet med Xultophy\u00ae, rapporterede om bedre erfaringer p\u00e5 alle diabetesspecifikke parametre sammenlignet med parametrene for basal-bolus-behandling, idet den st\u00f8rste forbedring i TRIM-D-scorerne s\u00e5s for diabetesregulering (16,7 mod 6,8), belastning af behandlingen (12,4 mod 4,3) og overholdelse af behandlingen (9,1 mod 3,9). Analysen af resultaterne fra sp\u00f8rgeskemaet SF-36 viste, at Xultophy\u00ae var forbundet med en statistisk signifikant h\u00f8jere score sammenlignet med basal-bolus-insulinbehandling for den del af sp\u00f8rgeskemaet, der handlede om psykisk sundhed; alle andre sammenligninger var ikke signifikante.1 \"Det at have diabetes er en kompleks situation i sig selv, og behandlingen skulle helst ikke g\u00f8re belastningen st\u00f8rre. Vi er meget glade for at se, at Xultophy\u00ae ikke bare hj\u00e6lper mennesker med type 2-diabetes med at n\u00e5 deres blodsukkerm\u00e5l, neds\u00e6tter risikoen for hypoglyk\u00e6mi og hj\u00e6lper dem med at tabe sig - men ogs\u00e5 g\u00f8r det p\u00e5 en enkel m\u00e5de,\" siger Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, koncerndirekt\u00f8r for forskning og udvikling i Novo Nordisk. \"Det er noget af det helt centrale for os, n\u00e5r vi taler om innovation indenfor diabetes. Det handler om at g\u00f8re livet s\u00e5 let som muligt for mennesker med diabetes.\" Denne analyse er baseret p\u00e5 patientrapporterede data (PRO) indsamlet som led i det kliniske DUAL VII-studie ved hj\u00e6lp af forskellige sundhedsrelaterede sp\u00f8rgeskemaer. TRIM-D-sp\u00f8rgeskemaet omhandler specifikt diabetes. SF-36 er et sp\u00f8rgeskema om sundhed generelt, der bruges til at m\u00e5le livskvalitet. Motivationen for at forts\u00e6tte igangv\u00e6rende behandling blev m\u00e5lt ved hj\u00e6lp af et motivationssp\u00f8rgeskema.1 I DUAL VII medf\u00f8rte Xultophy\u00ae st\u00f8rre forbedringer i PRO, prim\u00e6rt med hensyn til behandlingsm\u00e5l relateret til diabetesbehandling, belastning og overholdelse af behandling, sammenlignet med basal-bolus-behandling hos deltagere med et langtidsblodsukkerniveau (HbA1c) p\u00e5 7,0-10%, som var skiftet fra insulin glargin U100 plus metformin. Deltagere i behandling med Xultophy\u00ae opn\u00e5ede samme reduktion i HbA1c som ved basal-bolus-insulinbehandling foruden f\u00e6rre tilf\u00e6lde af hypoglyk\u00e6mi, f\u00e6rre daglige injektioner samt v\u00e6gttab. Forbedringen i PRO-m\u00e5lingerne med Xultophy\u00ae var i tr\u00e5d med de \u00f8nskede kliniske behandlingsresultater. Det, at studiet var ikke-blindet, var en begr\u00e6nsning og kan have p\u00e5virket resultaterne.1 \u00c6ndringer i PRO-scorerne blev udregnet i forhold til baseline efter 26 ugers behandling. PRO-data kom pr. definition direkte fra patienterne uden fortolkning af besvarelser fra l\u00e6ger eller andre.2 Fase 3b-studiet DUAL VII var tilrettelagt som et 26-ugers randomiseret, ikke-blindet multicenterstudie, der blev gennemf\u00f8rt i 12 lande og omfattede 506 deltagere.3 Studiet havde til form\u00e5l at unders\u00f8ge sikkerheden og effekten af Xultophy\u00ae sammenlignet med basal-bolus-behandling i voksne med type 2-diabetes, som tidligere var blevet behandlet med insulin glargin U100 og metformin.3 Xultophy\u00ae er et kombinationsprodukt best\u00e5ende af langtidsvirkende insulin degludec og GLP-1-receptoragonisten liraglutid i et fast kombinationsforhold i et pr\u00e6fyldt pensystem til dosering \u00e9n gang dagligt som \u00e9n injektion. Xultophy\u00ae er godkendt til behandling af voksne med type 2-diabetes med det form\u00e5l at opn\u00e5 forbedret blodsukkerregulering i kombination med blodsukkers\u00e6nkende l\u00e6gemidler i tabletform, n\u00e5r disse ikke alene eller kombineret med en GLP-1-receptoragonist eller basalinsulin giver en tilstr\u00e6kkelig regulering af blodsukkerniveauet. Xultophy\u00ae kan tages p\u00e5 et hvilket som helst tidspunkt af dagen, sammen med eller uden et m\u00e5ltid, helst p\u00e5 samme tidspunkt hver dag.4 Yderligere information  Referencer 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jodar E, Doshi A, Gouet D, et al.

Novo Nordisk's ambition is to further expand its leadership in the global diabetes and obesity care markets by discovering, developing and marketing improved insulin and GLP-1 analogues as well as completely new classes of biologics. Furthermore, it is Novo Nordisk's ambition to return to growth in the Biopharm area. The key topics of the day will be: In addition, the Capital Markets Day 2017 will include break-out sessions covering oral semaglutide and the associated production expansion, the regions in International Operations: Region China and Region AAMEO (Africa, Asia, Middle-East Oceania) as well as an update on the business dynamics in Biopharm Operations. NOVO NORDISK'S R&D STRATEGY AND KEY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTSNovo Nordisk's dedicated R&D strategy will be presented with special focus on key competitive advantages throughout the R&D value chain as well as the expansion into other serious chronic diseases. The presentation will outline the company's R&D strategy for delivering future innovative protein-based therapies addressing unmet medical needs driven by internal R&D capabilities and assets, expansion into other chronic disease areas, as well as an increased focus on external innovation. Furthermore, an update of the recent clinical results for key development projects within diabetes and obesity care, as well as a number of haemophilia and growth disorder projects, will be presented. The expected upcoming development and regulatory milestones for 2018 will also be outlined, including the expected reporting of the PIONEER phase 3a clinical trial programme for oral semaglutide, where all 10 trials in the programme are expected to be completed in 2018. NOVO NORDISK'S COMMERCIAL PRIORITIES WITHIN DIABETES CARENovo Nordisk's commercial priorities within diabetes care will be presented in two dedicated sessions focusing on insulin and GLP-1, respectively. Novo Nordisk has made a clear priority to maximise its global insulin franchise by focusing on improving both value and volume market shares driven by the innovative project portfolio of new-generation insulin and a commercial focus aligned with the specific market maturity and market access situation in the individual countries. Novo Nordisk will remain focused on building the leadership within GLP-1, but also on expanding the total GLP-1 market driven by the expected introduction of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide. Following the completion of the phase 3a clinical trial programme for once-daily oral semaglutide, the commercial focus will be directed towards launching in major geographies assuming a successful clinical and regulatory process. NOVO NORDISK'S AMBITION TO EXPAND THE GLOBAL OBESITY MARKETBy launching Saxenda\u00ae in more than 20 countries, Novo Nordisk has become a global market leader within obesity care. Novo Nordisk has the ambition to further build the obesity market by continuing the global roll-out of Saxenda\u00ae as well as continue its efforts towards having obesity acknowledged as a chronic disease, and thereby expanding the prescriber base. Following the positive clinical phase 2 results with subcutaneous semaglutide in obesity, Novo Nordisk plans to initiate a phase 3a clinical development, STEP, with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide in 2018. The global clinical programme is expected to enrol approximately 4,500 people with obesity and all main trials within the programme will have a duration of 68 weeks. In addition to the phase 3a programme, STEP, Novo Nordisk is also planning to initiate a landmark cardiovascular outcome trial in 2018 with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide in obesity with an expected enrolment of approximately 12,500 people. MARKET DYNAMICS IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND THE USAThe market dynamics for International Operations will be covered with focus on commercial ambitions and the diverse challenges in the five regions. The market opportunity in the USA remains significant despite a challenging payer environment; Novo Nordisk's expected plans for launching once-weekly semaglutide as well as continuing to improve the position within the insulin market will be covered.

De forventede udviklingsm\u00e6ssige og regulatoriske milep\u00e6le i 2018 vil ogs\u00e5 blive beskrevet, herunder den forventede rapportering af resultater fra det kliniske fase 3a-udviklingsprogram PIONEER med semaglutid i tabletform (oral semaglutid), hvor alle 10 studier i programmet forventes at blive afsluttet i 2018. NOVO NORDISKS KOMMERCIELLE PRIORITERINGER INDENFOR DIABETESBEHANDLINGNovo Nordisks kommercielle prioriteringer indenfor diabetesbehandling vil blive pr\u00e6senteret i to sessioner med fokus p\u00e5 henholdsvis insulin og GLP-1. Novo Nordisk har foretaget en klar prioritering om at maksimere den globale insulinforretning gennem \u00f8gede markedsandele m\u00e5lt i s\u00e5vel v\u00e6rdi som volumen drevet af den innovative projektportef\u00f8lje for den nye generation af insulin og et kommercielt fokus i tr\u00e5d med den specifikke markedsmodenhed og tilskudssituation i de enkelte lande. Novo Nordisk vil fortsat fokusere p\u00e5 at styrke sit lederskab indenfor GLP-1, men ogs\u00e5 p\u00e5 at udvide det samlede GLP-1-marked drevet af den forventede introduktion af ugentlig semaglutid i injektionsform (subkutan semaglutid). Efter afslutning af det kliniske fase 3a-udviklingsprogram med oral semaglutid til dosering \u00e9n gang dagligt vil det kommercielle fokus blive rettet mod lancering i st\u00f8rre geografiske markeder forudsat en succesfuld klinisk og regulatorisk proces. NOVO NORDISKS AMBITION OM AT UDBYGGE DET GLOBALE MARKED FOR FEDMEBEHANDLINGNovo Nordisk er gennem lanceringen af Saxenda\u00ae i flere end 20 lande blevet en af verdens f\u00f8rende virksomheder indenfor fedmebehandling. Novo Nordisk har en ambition om at udbygge markedet for fedmebehandling yderligere, dels ved at forts\u00e6tte den globale lancering af Saxenda\u00ae og dels ved at forts\u00e6tte indsatsen for at f\u00e5 fedme anerkendt som en kronisk sygdom og dermed udvide grundlaget af receptudskrivere. Efter de positive kliniske fase 2-resultater med subkutan semaglutid til behandling af sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt planl\u00e6gger Novo Nordisk at p\u00e5begynde et klinisk fase 3a-udviklingsprogram, STEP, med ugentlig subkutan semaglutid i 2018. Det globale kliniske program forventes at omfatte ca. 4.500 sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtige deltagere, og alle hovedstudier i dette program vil str\u00e6kke sig over 68 uger. Foruden fase 3a-programmet STEP har Novo Nordisk ogs\u00e5 planer om at p\u00e5begynde et stort kardiovaskul\u00e6rt sikkerhedsstudie i 2018 med ugentlig subkutan semaglutid indenfor fedme med en forventet deltagelse af ca. 12.500 deltagere. MARKEDSDYNAMIKKER I INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS OG USAMarkedsdynamikken i International Operations vil blive gennemg\u00e5et med fokus p\u00e5 kommercielle ambitioner og de forskelligartede udfordringer, der g\u00e6lder i de fem regioner.

Among the notable findings is that of the 71% of people with obesity who say they have spoken with a healthcare professional (HCP) about their weight in the past 5 years, only 55% report having been given a diagnosis of obesity and less than a quarter (24%) were offered follow-up care for this disease.2 ACTION data will be presented through poster and symposia forums at ObesityWeek, currently in progress in Washington DC. Designed to identify key barriers to care from the perspective of people with obesity, HCPs and employers, the results of the ACTION Study, according to multi-disciplinary steering committee members who led the initiative, can guide collaborative action to improve care, education and support for those who live with obesity. \"We in the healthcare community must ask why this epidemic is not being diagnosed and treated with the same urgency and focus as any other serious diseases?'\" said Dr Lee Kaplan, director of the Obesity, Metabolism and Nutrition Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital, ACTION steering committee member and lead author of the study. \"We need to fundamentally rethink obesity so that the public and healthcare community understand more about the biology, chronicity and overall health impact of this disease. Real progress can be achieved if we can overcome the entrenched mindsets that generate the barriers revealed by this study.\" Conducted with more than 3,500 participants spanning all three target groups, the ACTION Study reveals five key barriers to comprehensive care: \"The barriers identified in the study highlight opportunities to bridge gaps in understanding to facilitate true collaboration among all stakeholders,\" said study co-author and ACTION steering committee member Dr Angela Golden, owner of a specialty obesity practice in Arizona. \"Only by bridging these gaps will obesity care become integral to standard practice, whether in a healthcare or employment setting, and will people with obesity have the care and support needed to effectively treat their obesity.\" About ACTIONThe \"Awareness, Care and Treatment In Obesity Management\" (ACTION) Study is the first US nationwide study to investigate barriers to obesity management from the perspective of people with obesity, healthcare professionals and employers. In addition, the study aims to generate insights to guide collaborative action to improve obesity care, education and support. Sponsored by Novo Nordisk, the ACTION Study was led by a multi-disciplinary steering committee comprised of representatives from The Obesity Society, the Obesity Action Coalition, and the Integrated Benefits Institute as well as obesity experts in the fields of primary care, endocrinology, psychology and nursing. The study involved more than 3,000 people with obesity, 600 healthcare professionals, and 150 employers in the United States. To learn more about the study, please visit www.ACTIONStudy.com. About obesityObesity is a disease3,4 that requires long-term management. It is associated with many serious health consequences and decreased life expectancy.5,6 Obesity-related comorbidities include type 2 diabetes, heart disease, obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and certain types of cancer.5,7,8 It is a complex and multi-factorial disease that is influenced by physiological, psychological, environmental, socio-economic and genetic factors.9 The global increase in the prevalence of obesity is a public health issue that has severe cost implications to healthcare systems. In 2014, 13% of adults, or approximately 600 million adults, were living with obesity.10 Further information References 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Obesity and Overweight.

Det viser nye resultater fra ACTION-studiet (Awareness, Care and Treatment In Obesity Management), som i dag publiceres i Obesity,2 The Obesity Societys officielle tidsskrift. Studiet viser bl.a., at ud af de 71% af de sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtige, som angiver, at de har dr\u00f8ftet deres v\u00e6gt med en l\u00e6ge i l\u00f8bet af de seneste fem \u00e5r, har kun 55% f\u00e5et stillet diagnosen sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt, og mindre end en fjerdedel (24%) er blevet tilbudt opf\u00f8lgende behandling for sygdommen.2 Data fra ACTION-studiet vil blive pr\u00e6senteret via posters og symposier p\u00e5 Obesity Week, der i disse dage l\u00f8ber af stablen i Washington DC. Form\u00e5let med ACTION-studiet er at unders\u00f8ge de v\u00e6sentligste barrierer for behandling af sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt set fra forskellige perspektiver - de sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtiges, l\u00e6gernes og arbejdsgivernes. Resultaterne b\u00f8r if\u00f8lge medlemmer af den tv\u00e6rfaglige styregruppe bag initiativet bane vej for et samarbejde om at forbedre indsatsen i forhold til behandling, undervisning og st\u00f8tte til de mennesker, der lever med sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt. \"Vi i sundhedssektoren b\u00f8r sp\u00f8rge, hvorfor den her epidemi ikke bliver diagnosticeret og behandlet med samme seri\u00f8sitet og fokus som enhver anden alvorlig sygdom,\" siger dr. Lee Kaplan, leder af Obesity, Metabolism and Nutrition Institute ved Massachusetts General Hospital, medlem af styregruppen for ACTION og hovedforfatter til studiet. \"Vi er simpelthen n\u00f8dt til at redefinere sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt, s\u00e5 befolkningen og sundhedssektoren f\u00e5r en st\u00f8rre forst\u00e5else for biologien, den kroniske karakter og den generelle effekt p\u00e5 sundheden, som er forbundet med denne sygdom. F\u00f8rst n\u00e5r vi kommer ud over de forudindtagede holdninger, der ligger til grund for de barrierer, studiet p\u00e5viser, kan vi foretage de forbedringer i behandlingen, som er s\u00e5 n\u00f8dvendige.\" ACTION-studiet, der omfattede flere end 3.500 deltagere p\u00e5 tv\u00e6rs af de tre m\u00e5lgrupper, har afd\u00e6kket f\u00f8lgende fem v\u00e6sentlige barrierer for effektiv behandling: \"De barrierer, som studiet p\u00e5viser, giver os mulighed for at fremme forst\u00e5elsen af, hvordan vi kan forbedre samarbejdet mellem alle interessenter,\" siger medforfatter og medlem af styregruppen for ACTION dr. Angela Golden, som har sin egen praksis med speciale i sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt i Arizona, USA. \"Og vi er n\u00f8dt til at arbejde aktivt med at fremme denne forst\u00e5else for at g\u00f8re sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt til en del af standardpraksis - b\u00e5de hos l\u00e6gen og p\u00e5 arbejdspladsen - og for at sikre, at mennesker med sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt f\u00e5r den forn\u00f8dne hj\u00e6lp og st\u00f8tte til effektivt at f\u00e5 behandlet deres overv\u00e6gt.\" ACTION-studiet (Awareness, Care and Treatment In Obesity Management) er det f\u00f8rste landsd\u00e6kkende studie i USA, der unders\u00f8ger barrierer for v\u00e6gtregulering ud fra forskellige perspektiver - de sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtiges, l\u00e6gernes og arbejdsgivernes. Form\u00e5let med studiet er desuden at opn\u00e5 en viden, der g\u00f8r det muligt at samarbejde om at forbedre indsatsen i forhold til behandling af sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt, undervisning og st\u00f8tte til den overv\u00e6gtige. ACTION-studiet sponseres af Novo Nordisk og ledes af en tv\u00e6rfaglig styregruppe med repr\u00e6sentanter for The Obesity Society, Obesity Action Coalition og Integrated Benefits Institute samt eksperter i sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt indenfor prim\u00e6r behandling, endokrinologi, psykologi og sygepleje. I studiet deltog flere end 3.000 sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtige, 600 l\u00e6ger og 150 arbejdsgivere i USA. L\u00e6s mere om studiet p\u00e5 www.ACTIONStudy.com. Sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt er en sygdom,3,4 der kr\u00e6ver vedvarende indsats.

The target is set out alongside new research in a report launched today by the Cities Changing Diabetes partnership at a global summit in Houston, Texas. The report comes with the stark warning that achieving the goal requires cutting rates of obesity by a quarter. Bending the curve\u00a0Cases of diabetes are accelerating in every part of the world meaning that today, one \u00a0in 11 adults live with the condition.1 The report - Bending the Curve on Urban Diabetes - urges governments, city and health leaders to make changing\u00a0the trajectory of the disease a top global priority in order to 'bend the rising curve' of diabetes prevalence. Bending the curve means holding the rise of diabetes at a ceiling of one in ten adults living with the condition. To do this, ambitious action is needed on the single biggest modifiable risk factor for diabetes: obesity.2 Obesity must be reduced by 25% globally\u00a0by 2045, from today's level of 14% of the population in order to bend the curve.1 If nothing is done,\u00a0the research projects that 1.4 billion adults\u00a0(22.4% of adults) will live with obesity by 2045.1 This would result in\u00a0diabetes prevalence reaching one in nine adults - a\u00a0staggering 736 million people, and\u00a0almost 300\u00a0million\u00a0more\u00a0than\u00a0today.1 The impact of diabetes at this scale would be tragic for individuals, families, health systems and economies.\u00a0As a consequence, annual diabetes-related health expenditure would spiral to\u00a0more than\u00a01\u00a0trillion US dollars in 2045, up from 775 billion US dollars today, an increase of over 39%.1 And that is a conservative estimate. In contrast, bending the curve would prevent an extra 111 million\u00a0people\u00a0developing diabetes, more than the combined populations of the nine cities in the coalition, and would save society 200 billion dollars annually by 2045.1 The solution starts in cities\u00a0 While half of the world's population lives in cities, they are\u00a0home to two-thirds of people with diabetes - a number set to rise to three quarters of people with diabetes by the 2040s.3 Responding to the findings, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said: \"Action against diabetes has to start in cities. The way\u00a0cities are designed, built and run is fuelling an\u00a0urban obesity and diabetes pandemic that is already shortening millions of people's lives and resulting in billions in healthcare costs primarily related to the cost of treating complications.\" The\u00a0Cities Changing Diabetes programme was co-founded by Novo Nordisk, University College London and the Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen. The partnership comprises nine global city partners - Copenhagen, Houston, Johannesburg, Mexico City, Rome, Shanghai, Tianjin, Vancouver and Xiamen - together representing 75 million citizens - to pioneer\u00a0new approaches to map the challenge, understand the areas of greatest risk and vulnerability, and design interventions that are delivering real impact. Programme researchers are today releasing their findings alongside a bespoke projection tool at the Cities Changing Diabetes Summit in Houston, Texas. The tool enables individual cities to quickly and reliably assess the scale of their local diabetes and obesity challenge to guide future action. Furthermore, for the first time, the Cities Changing Diabetes programme will make publicly available the most\u00a0innovative and effective approaches from pioneer cities around the world. The 'Urban Diabetes Toolbox'\u00a0arms city and health leaders in any city to create their own action plan to tackle urban diabetes and obesity. Before addressing the 300 Summit delegates, Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen, president and chief executive officer, Novo Nordisk said:\u00a0\u00a0\"The urban diabetes pandemic is playing out in every major city around the world and the stakes are high.\u00a0We're calling upon all city leaders and their healthcare counterparts to come together to meet this challenge head on. Now is the time to fully measure and understand the local burden of disease and to create local action plans that together can combine to bend the curve on global diabetes. That means taking ambitious action on the biggest modifiable risk factor for diabetes: obesity.\" About Cities Changing DiabetesCities Changing Diabetes is a partnership programme to address the urban diabetes challenge. Initiated by Novo Nordisk, the programme is a response to the dramatic rise of urban diabetes and has been developed in partnership with University College London and Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, as well as a range of local partners including the diabetes\/health community, city governments, academic institutions, city experts (from a variety of fields) and civil society organisations. The aim of the programme is to map the problem, share solutions and drive concrete action to fight the diabetes challenge in the big cities around the world. Today, the programme represents 75 million citizens in nine cities worldwide: Copenhagen, Houston, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Rome, Tianjin, Shanghai, Vancouver and Xiamen.

I dag lever 437 mio. mennesker med sygdommen p\u00e5 globalt plan, det svarer til 9% af den voksne befolkning. Hvis udviklingen forts\u00e6tter, vil det tal stige til omkring 12% i 2045.1 Rapporten viser samtidig, at antallet af sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtige vil v\u00e6re steget til 1,4 mia. voksne i 2045 (22,4% af den voksne befolkning).1 Da sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt er den st\u00f8rste modificerbare risikofaktor i forhold til udviklingen af type 2-diabetes2, vil det betyde, at 736 mio. mennesker, n\u00e6sten 300 mio. flere end i dag, vil leve med diabetes.1 Konsekvenserne vil v\u00e6re katastrofale - for den enkelte, sundhedssystemerne og samfunds\u00f8konomien.\u00a0De \u00e5rlige diabetesrelaterede sundhedsudgifter vil n\u00e5 op p\u00e5 1 billion amerikanske dollars i 2045, hvilket vil v\u00e6re en stigning p\u00e5 over 39% i forhold til 775 mia. dollars i dag.1 Hvis kurven for diabetes skal kn\u00e6kkes, er der p\u00e5 globalt plan behov for en ambiti\u00f8s indsats for at nedbringe antallet af sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtige. Af rapporten fremg\u00e5r det, at 14% af voksne i verden i dag er sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtige.1 Beregninger viser, at for at kn\u00e6kke kurven skal forekomsten af diabetes ned p\u00e5 1 ud af 10 voksne, ved at antallet af sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtige reduceres med 25% frem mod 2045.1 Hvis det lykkes at kn\u00e6kke diabeteskurven, vil 111 mio. f\u00e6rre mennesker udvikle diabetes, hvilket vil spare samfundet for 200 mia. dollars i 2045.1 L\u00f8sningen findes i byerne Halvdelen af verdens befolkning bor i byer, og de er hjemsted for to tredjedele af alle mennesker med diabetes - den andel vil stige til tre fjerdedele frem mod 2040'erne.3 Cities Changing Diabetes er startet i 2014 i f\u00e6llesskab af Novo Nordisk, University College London og Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen. Partnerskabet omfatter ni storbyer verden over - K\u00f8benhavn, Houston, Johannesburg, Mexico City, Rom, Shanghai, Tianjin, Vancouver og Xiamen med i alt 75 mio. indbyggere. M\u00e5let er at udvikle nye metoder til at kortl\u00e6gge diabetesudfordringen, udveksle viden og erfaringer samt iv\u00e6rks\u00e6tte handling, der g\u00f8r en reel forskel. K\u00f8benhavn er med p\u00e5 topm\u00f8det i Houston. Her deler byen sine erfaringer om diabetes og sundhedsm\u00e6ssig ulighed i en by, der ellers er anerkendt globalt for at v\u00e6re sund, gr\u00f8n og byde p\u00e5 h\u00f8j livskvalitet. K\u00f8benhavns sundheds- og omsorgsborgmester, Ninna Thomsen, siger: \"Selvom f\u00e6rre mennesker i K\u00f8benhavn har diabetes sammenlignet med mange af verdens andre storbyer, har vi stadig den udfordring, at tallet stiger, og diabetes rammer socialt sk\u00e6vt. Vi skal have lighed i sundhed. Det er kernen i vores sundhedspolitik - alle borgere i byen har ret til et langt og godt liv.\" P\u00e5 topm\u00f8det deler byerne bag Cities Changing Diabetes-initiativet deres erfaringer og egne handlingsplaner i en s\u00e5kaldt 'Urban Diabetes Toolbox'. Den best\u00e5r af en ny, specialudviklet model til fremskrivning af forekomsten af sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt og diabetes samt af et v\u00e6ld af initiativer, som byer over hele verden har erfaringer med. Med den kan politiske og sundhedsfaglige ledere verden over f\u00e5 inspiration til at udvikle deres egne handlingsplaner. Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen, administrerende direkt\u00f8r for Novo Nordisk, sagde inden sin tale til de 300 topm\u00f8dedeltagere: \"Diabetespandemien raser i alle storbyer verden over, og der st\u00e5r meget p\u00e5 spil, b\u00e5de for den enkelte, sundhedssystemerne og samfunds\u00f8konomien. Med Cities Changing Diabetes fors\u00f8ger vi at samle alle, der vil v\u00e6re med til at g\u00f8re noget ved problemet. Vi opfordrer nu ledere og beslutningstagere i verdens storbyer til at forpligte sig til et ambiti\u00f8st m\u00e5l for at kn\u00e6kke kurven for diabetes. Ved at s\u00e6tte ind overfor sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt kan vi g\u00f8re st\u00f8rst forskel. Men det er et ambiti\u00f8st m\u00e5l, vi opfordrer til, s\u00e5 nyt\u00e6nkning og samarbejde p\u00e5 tv\u00e6rs af traditionelle skel er helt afg\u00f8rende, hvis vi skal v\u00e6k fra den katastrofekurs, vi er p\u00e5 nu.\" Om Cities Changing Diabetes Cities Changing Diabetes er et partnerskabsprogram, der skal tackle diabetesudfordringen i verdens storbyer. Programmet er lanceret af Novo Nordisk som reaktion p\u00e5 den kraftige stigning i forekomsten af diabetes i storbyer og er udviklet i samarbejde med University College London (UCL) og Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen (SDCC) samt en r\u00e6kke lokale partnere, herunder diabetes- og sundhedsorganisationer, bystyrer, forskningsinstitutioner, byudviklingseksperter (fra mange specialistomr\u00e5der) og civilsamfundsorganisationer. Form\u00e5let med initiativet er at kortl\u00e6gge problemet, udveksle l\u00f8sninger og iv\u00e6rks\u00e6tte konkrete handlinger for at l\u00f8se diabetesudfordringen i verdens storbyer. I dag repr\u00e6senterer programmet 75 mio. borgere i ni byer over hele verden: K\u00f8benhavn, Houston, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Rom, Tianjin, Shanghai, Vancouver og Xiamen.

One member of the committee abstained. Based on the data included in the New Drug Application (NDA) for semaglutide, the FDA asked the panel members to discuss whether Novo Nordisk has provided adequate evidence to establish the efficacy and safety profile of semaglutide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults. The recommendation for approval was based on a global development programme involving more than 8,000 adults with type 2 diabetes in the eight SUSTAIN phase 3a clinical trials, including a cardiovascular outcomes trial. \"Semaglutide has demonstrated the potential to improve the treatment of type 2 diabetes and the positive recommendation from the Advisory Committee marks an important step towards making semaglutide available to adults with type 2 diabetes in the US. We look forward to working with the FDA as they complete their review of semaglutide,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer. The NDA for once-weekly semaglutide was submitted to the FDA in December 2016 under the US FDA's Prescription Drug User Fee Act V (PDUFA V) regulation. Semaglutide is currently under review by several regulatory agencies, including the European Medicines Agency and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency.

The FDA's decision comes after Fiasp\u00ae in clinical trials demonstrated benefits for people in need of improved overall glucose control. Fiasp\u00ae is an innovative formulation of insulin aspart (NovoLog\u00ae) developed with the aim of obtaining pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that more closely match the natural physiological insulin mealtime response of a person without diabetes. In clinical trials Fiasp\u00ae has demonstrated clinically relevant improvement in long-term glucose level (HbA1c). These results were achieved with a comparable overall rate of severe or blood-sugar confirmed hypoglycaemia, between Fiasp\u00ae and insulin aspart. \"We are very pleased that Fiasp\u00ae will now also be available to people with diabetes in the US,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"The fast action profile of Fiasp\u00ae allows people with diabetes convenient timing in terms of when to take their insulin in connection with meals to achieve the optimal blood sugar control.\" About Fiasp\u00ae Fiasp\u00ae is insulin aspart in an innovative formulation, in which two excipients have been added: Vitamin B3 (niacinamide) to increase the speed of absorption and a naturally occurring amino acid (L-Arginine) for stability.

DEVOTE is a randomised, multinational and double-blinded trial conducted to confirm the cardiovascular safety of Tresiba\u00ae compared to insulin glargine U100 when added to standard of care, in people with type 2 diabetes. In the trial, the primary endpoint was achieved by demonstrating non-inferiority of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) with Tresiba\u00ae compared to insulin glargine U100. Severe hypoglycaemia was evaluated as a secondary endpoint and 27% fewer patients in the Tresiba\u00ae treated group experienced an episode of severe hypoglycaemia, resulting in a 40% overall rate reduction of total episodes of adjudicated severe hypoglycaemia. Furthermore, patients in the Tresiba\u00ae treated group experienced a 53% relative reduction in the rate of nocturnal severe hypoglycaemia. These differences were all statistically significant. \"Our ambition is to help people with type 2 diabetes reach their treatment goals and at the same time reduce their risk of severe hypoglycaemia,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"With the CHMP's endorsement of the updated label for Tresiba\u00ae we have passed a major milestone in insulin therapy.\" DEVOTE is the first cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) comparing two basal insulins. DEVOTE is a multinational, double-blinded clinical trial which investigated the cardiovascular safety of Tresiba\u00ae compared with insulin glargine U100 over 104 weeks. In the trial, 7,637 people with type 2 diabetes at high risk of, or existing, cardiovascular disease were randomised to treatment with either Tresiba\u00ae or insulin glargine U100 in vial in addition to standard of care. In the trial, the primary endpoint was achieved by demonstrating non-inferiority of MACE with Tresiba\u00ae compared to insulin glargine U100. The primary endpoint was defined as the MACE composite outcome of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke and showed a hazard ratio of 0.91 in favour of Tresiba\u00ae relative to insulin glargine U100, with no statistically significant difference between the two treatments. Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) is a once-daily basal insulin that provides duration of action of at least 42 hours. Tresiba\u00ae is taken once daily, at any time of day. Patients who miss or are delayed in taking their dose of Tresiba\u00ae can take their dose as soon as they remember, but ensuring there are at least eight hours between doses. Tresiba\u00ae was approved by the European Commission in January 2013 and has since been approved in more than 80 countries globally.

DEVOTE er det f\u00f8rste kardiovaskul\u00e6re sikkerhedsstudie, der har sammenlignet to basalinsuliner, og det omfattede mere end 7.500 mennesker med type 2-diabetes. Alle deltagere havde enten en h\u00f8j risiko for eller eksisterende hjerte-kar-sygdom og fik i forvejen standardbehandling for at reducere risikoen for hjerte-kar-tilf\u00e6lde.3 Studiet viste, at Tresiba\u00ae ikke \u00f8ger hjerte-kar-risikoen sammenlignet med insulin glargin U100 og giver en signifikant reduktion i forekomsten af alvorlig og natlig alvorlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi med sammenlignelige niveauer af glyk\u00e6misk kontrol.3 Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) er en basalinsulin til dosering \u00e9n gang dagligt. Den har en virkningsvarighed p\u00e5 mere end 42 timer med en flad og stabil blodsukkers\u00e6nkende effekt.6,7 Tresiba\u00ae medf\u00f8rer en lav variation i blodsukkeret og en lavere risiko for generel, natlig og alvorlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi sammenlignet med insulin glargin U100.3,7 I situationer, hvor det ikke er muligt at tage insulin p\u00e5 det samme tidspunkt hver dag, giver Tresiba\u00ae mulighed for fleksibilitet med hensyn til injektionstidspunktet fra dag til dag, men med mindst otte timer mellem doserne.7 Tresiba\u00ae blev godkendt af registreringsmyndighederne f\u00f8rste gang i september 2012 og er siden blevet godkendt i flere end 80 lande verden over. Det er nu p\u00e5 markedet i flere end 50 lande. Yderligere information Referencer 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zinman B, Marso SP, Poulter NR, et al.

The risk was four-fold higher 15 days after an event and two and a half-fold higher anytime following an episode of severe hypoglycaemia.1 In addition, results also showed that daily fluctuations in blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes are associated with a higher risk of death. The results were presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes 53rd Annual Meeting (EASD) and simultaneously published in Diabetologia.1,2 \"Episodes of severe hypoglycaemia are not only distressing for patients and potentially dangerous, they are also associated with an increased risk of death,\" said Dr Bernard Zinman of the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto, Canada and member of the DEVOTE Steering Committee. \"These results highlight the importance of maintaining low variability in blood sugar levels and reducing the risk of severe hypoglycaemia when treating people with type 2 diabetes.\" In the DEVOTE trial, Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) reduced the rate of severe hypoglycaemia by 40% and the rate of nocturnal severe hypoglycaemia by 53% compared to insulin glargine U100 in people with type 2 diabetes.3 Similar reductions were seen in the SWITCH 2 trial with 51% lower rates of severe hypoglycaemia during the full treatment period of the trial and a 42% reduction in the rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemia compared to insulin glargine U100 in people with type 2 diabetes.4 Studies have also shown that Tresiba\u00ae provides significantly lower variability in blood sugar levels compared to insulin glargine U100 and U300.5,6 DEVOTE is a multinational, double-blinded clinical trial which investigated the cardiovascular safety of Tresiba\u00ae compared with insulin glargine U100 over 104 weeks. DEVOTE is the first cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) comparing two basal insulins and enrolled more than 7,500 people with type 2 diabetes. All participants had a high risk of, or existing, cardiovascular disease and were already receiving standard of care to reduce their cardiovascular risk.3 The trial demonstrated that Tresiba\u00ae does not increase cardiovascular risk compared with insulin glargine U100, and provides a significant reduction in the rate of severe and nocturnal severe hypoglycaemia at similar levels of glycaemic control.3 Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) is a once-daily basal insulin that provides a duration of action beyond 42 hours with a flat and stable glucose-lowering effect.6,7 It provides low variability in blood glucose levels and a lower risk of overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia vs. insulin glargine U100.3,7 On occasions when administration at the same time of day is not possible, Tresiba\u00ae allows for flexibility in day-to-day dosing time with a minimum of eight hours between injections.7 Tresiba\u00ae received its first regulatory approval in September 2012 and has since been approved in more than 80 countries globally. It is now commercially available in more than 50 countries. Further information References 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zinman B, Marso SP, Poulter NR, et al.

A small but statistically significant increase in heart rate was also observed with Xultophy\u00ae.1 \"People with type 2 diabetes have a higher risk of a heart attack or stroke compared to the general population, so reducing this risk as much as possible should be a central goal of treatment\", said Professor Tina Vilsb\u00f8ll, Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Denmark & Center for Diabetes Research, Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark. \"I am very pleased to see the beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk markers provided by Xultophy\u00ae.\" CVD is the principal cause of death and disability among people with type 2 diabetes globally, with approximately two-thirds of deaths in people with diabetes attributable to CVD.2 Therefore, treatments for type 2 diabetes should not only lower blood sugar levels but also decrease CV risk.3 \"This added benefit of Xultophy\u00ae is certainly great news for the population at risk of developing cardiovascular disease on top of their existing type 2 diabetes\", said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"At Novo Nordisk we strive to develop innovative treatments, reinforcing our long-term commitment to defeat diabetes. Xultophy\u00ae is a key component of this commitment.\" About the studyThe CV risk markers data came from a new post-hoc analysis of two Xultophy\u00ae randomised-controlled clinical trials, comparing the efficacy and safety of Xultophy\u00ae against insulin degludec in DUAL II and against insulin glargine U100 in DUAL V, both with metformin for 26 weeks.4,5 These trials were conducted in people with type 2 diabetes not achieving glycaemic control \u00a0(HbA1c 7.5-10.0% in DUAL II; 7.0-10.0% in DUAL V) on basal insulin (20-40 units in DUAL II; 20-50 units in DUAL V). The primary results from these trials have been reported previously.4,5 About Xultophy\u00aeXultophy\u00ae is a once-daily single injection fixed-ratio combination of long-acting insulin degludec (Tresiba\u00ae) and the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide (Victoza\u00ae) in one pen. It is indicated for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control in combination with oral glucose-lowering medicinal products when these alone or combined with basal insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic control. Xultophy\u00ae is given once daily by subcutaneous injection. Xultophy\u00ae can be administered at any time of the day with or without meals, preferably at the same time of the day.6 On 18 September 2014, Xultophy\u00ae was granted marketing authorisation by the European Commission. On 21 November 2016, Xultophy\u00ae was approved by the FDA under the brand name Xultophy\u00ae 100\/3.6.6,7 References","256":"Lissabon, Portugal, den 13. september 2017 - Xultophy\u00ae (insulin degludec\/liraglutid) medf\u00f8rer en signifikant reduktion af en r\u00e6kke risikofaktorer forbundet med en \u00f8get risiko for hjerte-kar-sygdom hos mennesker med type 2-diabetes, sammenlignet med basalinsulin.1 Det viser en ny post hoc-analyse, som pr\u00e6senteres i dag p\u00e5 EASD 2017, den 53. \u00e5rlige kongres i det europ\u00e6iske diabetesselskab European Association for the Study of Diabetes.

Comparators included placebo, sitagliptin, insulin glargine U100 or exenatide extended release (ER). The analysis was presented today at the 53rd Annual Meeting of the European Association For The Study Of Diabetes.1 \"As a physician, helping patients with type 2 diabetes achieve glycaemic and weight loss targets can be challenging,\" said Dr Helena Rodbard, SUSTAIN 5 investigator and medical director at Endocrine and Metabolic Consultants, Rockville, Maryland. \"The meaningful reductions demonstrated with semaglutide in both glucose and body weight are encouraging, as more treatment strategies are needed to help meet this challenge.\" Significantly more people treated with once-weekly semaglutide achieved the clinically meaningful composite endpoint of >1% HbA1c reduction and\u00a0>5% weight loss with 0.5 mg (25-35%) and 1.0 mg (38-56%) semaglutide vs. all comparators (2-13%; p<0.0001) in SUSTAIN 1-5.1 In addition, more people achieved the composite endpoint with once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mg compared with semaglutide 0.5 mg (p<0.0001 for SUSTAIN 2, 4 and 5; p=0.17 for SUSTAIN 1).1 In this post-hoc analysis, semaglutide was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. The most common adverse event with semaglutide was nausea. In SUSTAIN 1-4, severe or blood glucose confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia events were fewer or similar with once-weekly semaglutide vs. comparators. In SUSTAIN 5, on a background of basal insulin, more events were observed with once-weekly semaglutide than with placebo.1 About semaglutideSemaglutide is a once-weekly analogue of human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) that stimulates insulin and suppresses glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, while decreasing appetite and food intake.2-5 Once-weekly semaglutide is currently under review by seven regulatory agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA).

Det viser nye forskningsresultater, som pr\u00e6senteres i dag p\u00e5 EASD, den 53. \u00e5rlige kongres i det europ\u00e6iske diabetesselskab European Association for the Study of Diabetes. Resultaterne viser, at Fiasp\u00ae fastholdt den signifikante forbedring i den generelle blodsukkerregulering, som var set i en kortere periode af studiet (26 uger)1. De bekr\u00e6fter desuden sikkerhedsprofilen for Fiasp\u00ae og viser en sammenlignelig samlet forekomst af hypoglyk\u00e6mi (lavt blodsukker), alvorlig eller bekr\u00e6ftet ved blodsukkerm\u00e5ling4. \"Disse resultater bekr\u00e6fter de positive fordele p\u00e5 lang sigt, som Fiasp\u00ae har i forhold til konventionel insulin aspart,\" siger Chantal Mathieu, fors\u00f8gsansvarlig professor, leder af Endokrinologisk Afdeling og medicinsk professor ved Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgien. \"Det betyder, at Fiasp\u00ae potentielt vil kunne tilbyde mennesker med diabetes, der har problemer med at regulere deres blodsukker efter m\u00e5ltiderne, en bedre mulighed for at opfylde deres behov.\" Efter et m\u00e5ltid stiger blodsukkeret hurtigt. Hvis man har diabetes, kan kroppen enten ikke f\u00e5 de h\u00f8je blodsukkerniveauer ned, eller har meget sv\u00e6rt ved det. Vedvarende h\u00f8jt blodsukker efter m\u00e5ltider er forbundet med en \u00f8get risiko for hjerte-kar-sygdom og andre diabetesrelaterede komplikationer, herunder skader i \u00f8jne og nyrer, samt kr\u00e6ft5,6. H\u00f8je blodsukkerniveauer efter m\u00e5ltider medvirker desuden til en utilstr\u00e6kkelig generel blodsukkerregulering2,5,7. M\u00e5ltidsinsulin har til form\u00e5l at s\u00e6nke blodsukkerniveauet, efter man har spist, men konventionelle hurtigtvirkende insuliner virker ikke lige s\u00e5 hurtigt som kroppens naturlige fysiologiske insulinrespons. Den langsommere respons g\u00f8r, at mennesker med diabetes kan blive ved med at have forh\u00f8jet blodsukker i lang tid efter et m\u00e5ltid2. \"Sammenlignet med konventionel insulin aspart matcher Fiasp\u00ae kroppens naturlige fysiologiske insulinrespons bedre og giver dermed en bedre langtidsregulering af blodsukkeret,\" siger Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, koncerndirekt\u00f8r for forskning og udvikling i Novo Nordisk. \"Fiasp\u00ae giver fordele for mennesker med diabetes og hj\u00e6lper dem med at opn\u00e5 bedre blodsukkerregulering, b\u00e5de generelt og efter m\u00e5ltider.\" Onset 1-studiet (1.143 deltagere randomiseret) var et delvist dobbeltblindet, basal-bolus, treat to target-studie i fase 3a, som vurderede effekt og sikkerhed af Fiasp\u00ae sammenlignet med konventionel insulin aspart i type 1-diabetes gennem 52 uger fordelt p\u00e5 to 26-ugers behandlingsperioder. Resultaterne fra de fulde 52 uger blev pr\u00e6senteret p\u00e5 EASD 2017. I 52-ugers-perioden viste Fiasp\u00ae en statistisk signifikant st\u00f8rre generel blodsukkerreduktion p\u00e5 -0,10% hos voksne med type 1-diabetes, sammenlignet med konventionel insulin aspart. Fiasp\u00ae viste desuden en statistisk signifikant reduktion i blodsukkerstigningen 1 time efter et m\u00e5ltid p\u00e5 -0,91 mmol\/l; der s\u00e5s ingen signifikant forskel i blodsukkerstigningen 2 timer efter et m\u00e5ltid, sammenlignet med konventionel insulin aspart. Disse resultater blev opn\u00e5et med en sammenlignelig forekomst af hypoglyk\u00e6mi (alvorlig eller bekr\u00e6ftet ved blodsukkerm\u00e5ling) ved de to behandlinger4. Fiasp\u00ae er den eneste godkendte ultra-hurtigtvirkende1-3 m\u00e5ltidsinsulin i en ny generation af insulin. Fiasp\u00ae er insulin aspart i en ny formulering, hvor der er tilsat to hj\u00e6lpestoffer: B3-vitamin (niacinamid) for at \u00f8ge optagelseshastigheden og en naturligt forekommende aminosyre (L-arginin) for at sikre stabilitet8. Fiasp\u00ae fik markedsf\u00f8ringstilladelse fra Europa-Kommissionen den 9. januar 2017, fra Health Canada den 6. januar, fra Swissmedic den 7. juni og fra Australian Government Department of Health den 28. juni. Fiasp\u00ae er p.t. under regulatorisk behandling i flere end 10 lande. Efter at have modtaget et Complete Response Letter (CRL) fra de amerikanske sundhedsmyndigheder (FDA) i oktober 2016 genindsendte Novo Nordisk registreringsans\u00f8gningen for hurtigtvirkende insulin aspart som en Class II Resubmission den 29. marts 2017, og FDA-godkendelse forventes i slutningen af tredje kvartal af 2017.

The findings were presented today at the 53rd European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) Annual Meeting, and showed that Fiasp\u00ae maintained the significant improvement in overall blood sugar control that was seen in a shorter-term (26 weeks) study period1. The results also reconfirmed the safety profile of Fiasp\u00ae, showing comparable overall numbers of severe or blood-sugar confirmed hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels)4. \"These results provide reassurance of the meaningful long-term benefits of Fiasp\u00ae versus conventional insulin aspart,\" said Professor Chantal Mathieu, study investigator, chair of Endocrinology and professor of Medicine at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium. \"Accordingly, for people with diabetes who struggle to control their post-meal sugar levels, Fiasp\u00ae might offer a better option to meet their needs.\" After eating, blood sugar levels rise rapidly. In diabetes, the body either cannot bring these high sugar levels down, or struggles to do so. Sustained high post-meal sugar levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and other diabetes-related complications, including damage to eyes and kidneys and cancer5,6. High post-meal sugar levels also contribute to inadequate overall blood sugar control2,5,7. While mealtime insulins aim to bring post-meal sugar levels down, conventional rapid-acting insulins are not as fast as the speed of the natural physiological insulin response. Due to this slower response, people with diabetes can remain in an elevated post-meal sugar state for an extended period2. \"Compared to conventional insulin aspart, Fiasp\u00ae is a closer match to the natural physiological insulin response, leading to better long-term blood sugar control,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"Fiasp\u00ae delivers benefits for people with diabetes, helping them to achieve better post-meal and overall blood sugar control.\" About the studyThe onset 1 trial (1,143 people randomised) was a phase 3a, partially double-blind, basal-bolus, treat-to-target trial, evaluating the efficacy and safety of Fiasp\u00ae compared with conventional insulin aspart in type 1 diabetes over 52 weeks, in two 26 week treatment periods. The findings from the 52 week study period were presented at the EASD Annual Meeting 2017. In the 52 week study period, Fiasp\u00ae demonstrated a statistically significantly greater overall blood sugar reduction of -0.10% in adults with type 1 diabetes, in comparison to conventional insulin aspart. Fiasp\u00ae also showed a statistically significant reduction in 1-hour post-meal sugar increment of -0.91 mmol\/L; no significant difference was seen in 2-hour post-meal sugar increment, compared with conventional insulin aspart. These results were achieved with a comparable overall rate of severe or blood-sugar confirmed hypoglycaemia between the two treatments4. About Fiasp\u00aeFiasp\u00ae is the only approved, new-generation, ultra-fast acting1-3 mealtime insulin. Fiasp\u00ae is insulin aspart in an innovative formulation, in which two excipients have been added: Vitamin B3 (niacinamide) to increase the speed of absorption and a naturally occurring amino acid (L-Arginine) for stability8. Fiasp\u00ae received marketing authorisation from the European Commission on 9 January, from Health Canada on 6 January, from Swissmedic on 7 June and from the Australian Government Department of Health on 28 June 2017. It is currently under regulatory review in over 10 countries. After receiving a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2016, Novo Nordisk resubmitted the fast-acting insulin aspart new drug application (NDA) as a class II resubmission on 29 March 2017 and FDA approval is expected at the end of Q3 2017. _______________________  References","261":"Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark, 5 September 2017 \u00ad- Today, Novo Nordisk announced it has reached a resolution with the US federal government and the states about an investigation launched in February 2011 concerning sales and marketing practices for Victoza\u00ae, a medicine to treat type 2 diabetes. The investigation was disclosed by Novo Nordisk for the first time in a company announcement on 16 February 2011. The settlement resolves claims alleging Novo Nordisk did not fully comply with communicating safety information based on a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for Victoza\u00ae. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Novo Nordisk will pay approximately 46.5 million US dollars to the federal government and to states that reimbursed for Victoza\u00ae under their Medicaid programmes.\u00a0Additionally, Novo Nordisk will pay 12.15 million dollars to resolve a complaint filed by the government on behalf of the FDA in federal court. In connection with this settlement, the Company has also resolved several private whistle-blower cases related to the government's investigation. The US Department of Health & Human Services, Office of Inspector General, determined that it would not seek a Corporate Integrity Agreement as part of this settlement. \"At Novo Nordisk, we take our responsibility to communicate the safety and clinical benefits of our medicines seriously, and remain committed to properly addressing safety questions healthcare professionals ask every day,\" said Douglas Langa, executive vice president, North America Operations. \"Our focus will always be to ensure that those caring for patients have the data they need to make the most informed treatment decision.\u00a0While we do not agree with the US government's legal conclusions and deny any wrongdoing, we're pleased to have negotiated a resolution that allows the company to return its full attention to developing medicines that help improve the lives of patients.\" Further information","262":"Bagsv\u00e6rd, den 5. september 2017 - Novo Nordisk meddeler i dag, at der er indg\u00e5et et forlig med den amerikanske forbundsregering og delstaterne om en unders\u00f8gelse, der blev indledt i februar 2011 vedr\u00f8rende virksomhedens salgs- og markedsf\u00f8ringspraksis for Victoza\u00ae, et l\u00e6gemiddel til behandling af type 2-diabetes.

Antallet af deltagere, som indberettede bivirkningen diabetisk \u00f8jensygdom (retinopati), var lav og sammenlignelig i begge semaglutid- og dulaglutid-grupperne (henholdsvis 4 og 5 h\u00e6ndelser). \"Den statistisk signifikante blodsukkerkontrol og v\u00e6gtreduktion, som deltagerne i dette studie har opn\u00e5et med semaglutid sammenlignet med dulaglutid, er en yderligere styrkelse af de enest\u00e5ende resultater, vi har set hele vejen igennem SUSTAIN-programmet,\" siger Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, koncerndirekt\u00f8r for forskning og udvikling i Novo Nordisk. \"Vi er glade for semaglutids potentiale til at s\u00e6tte en ny standard for behandlingen af type 2-diabetes.\" Semaglutid er en ugentlig analog af det naturlige hormon glukagonlignende peptid-1 (GLP-1), som stimulerer udskillelsen af insulin og reducerer sekretionen af glukagon p\u00e5 en glukoseafh\u00e6ngig m\u00e5de, samt neds\u00e6tter appetit og madindtag. Der er indsendt registreringsans\u00f8gning for semaglutid til dosering \u00e9n gang ugentligt til seks regulatoriske myndigheder, herunder de amerikanske sundhedsmyndigheder, FDA, Det Europ\u00e6iske L\u00e6gemiddelagentur og de japanske sundhedsmyndigheder, Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency. SUSTAIN 7 er et 40-ugers fase 3b-studie til vurdering af effekt og sikkerhed af 0,5 mg semaglutid sammenlignet med 0,75 mg dulaglutid samt 1,0 mg semaglutid sammenlignet med 1,5 mg dulaglutid, begge givet \u00e9n gang ugentligt som till\u00e6gsbehandling til metformin hos 1.201 mennesker med type 2-diabetes. Det prim\u00e6re effektm\u00e5l var \u00e6ndring i langtidsblodsukkeret (HbA1c) i forhold til udgangspunktet ved studiets start (baseline) efter 40 ugers behandling med semaglutid sammenlignet med dulaglutid. SUSTAIN (Semaglutide Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes) er et klinisk udviklingsprogram for semaglutid doseret \u00e9n gang ugentligt.

The 40-week trial investigated the efficacy and safety of 0.5 mg semaglutide compared with 0.75 dulaglutide and 1.0 mg semaglutide compared with 1.5 mg dulaglutide, when added to metformin. From a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.2%, 0.5 mg semaglutide achieved a statistically significant and superior reduction of 1.5% compared with a reduction of 1.1% with 0.75 mg dulaglutide. People treated with 1.0 mg semaglutide experienced a statistically significant and superior reduction of 1.8% compared with a reduction of 1.4% with 1.5 mg dulaglutide. Using the American Diabetes Association (ADA) treatment target of HbA1c below or equal to 7.0%, 69 68% of people treated with 0.5 mg semaglutide compared with 52% of people treated with 0.75 mg dulaglutide reached the treatment goal, and 79% of people treated with 1.0 mg semaglutide compared to 68 67% with 1.5 mg dulaglutide reached the treatment goal. Using the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) treatment target of HbA1c below or equal to 6.5%, 51 49% of people treated with 0.5 mg semaglutide compared with 36 34% of people treated with 0.75 mg dulaglutide reached the treatment goal, and 68 67% of people treated with 1.0 mg semaglutide compared to 49 47% with 1.5 mg dulaglutide reached the treatment goal. Furthermore, from a mean baseline body weight of 95 kg and a BMI of 33.5 kg\/m2, people treated with 0.5 mg semaglutide experienced a statistically significant and superior weight loss of 4.6 kg compared to 2.3 kg with 0.75 mg dulaglutide. People treated with 1.0 mg semaglutide experienced a statistically significant and superior weight loss of 6.5 kg compared to 3.0 kg with 1.5 mg dulaglutide. 44% of people treated with 0.5 mg semaglutide compared with 23% of people treated with 0.75 mg dulaglutide achieved more or equal to 5% body weight loss and 63% of people with 1.0 mg semaglutide compared with 30% of people treated with 1.5 mg dulaglutide. In the trial, semaglutide demonstrated a safe and well-tolerated profile consistent with results from the SUSTAIN programme. The most common adverse event for both semaglutide dosages was mild to moderate nausea, which was overall comparable to dulaglutide and diminished over time. Premature treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was less than 10% across all treatment groups. The number of people reporting an adverse event of diabetic retinopathy was low and comparable in both the semaglutide and dulaglutide groups (4 and 5 events, respectively). \"The superior glucose control and weight loss achieved with semaglutide compared to dulaglutide in this trial reinforces the unprecedented results observed in the entire SUSTAIN programme\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"We are excited about the potential of semaglutide to set a new standard for treatment of type 2 diabetes\". About semaglutide Semaglutide is a once-weekly analogue of human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) that stimulates insulin and suppresses glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, while decreasing appetite and food intake. Once-weekly semaglutide is currently under review by seven regulatory agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency. SUSTAIN 7SUSTAIN 7 is a phase 3b, 40-week, efficacy and safety trial of 0.5 mg semaglutide vs 0.75 mg dulaglutide and 1.0 mg semaglutide vs 1.5 mg dulaglutide, both once-weekly, as add-on to metformin in 1,201 people with type 2 diabetes. The primary outcome measure was change in HbA1c from baseline after 40 weeks of treatment with semaglutide compared to dulaglutide. About the SUSTAIN clinical programme SUSTAIN (Semaglutide Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes) is a clinical trial programme for semaglutide, administered once weekly, that comprises seven phase 3 global clinical trials, including a cardiovascular outcomes trial, involving more than 8,000 adults with type 2 diabetes.

Studiet unders\u00f8gte sikkerheden af semaglutid og dets potentiale for at fremkalde og fastholde v\u00e6gttab hos sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtige mennesker. I studiet blev 957 sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtige deltagere randomiseret til behandling med doser af semaglutid p\u00e5 mellem 0,05 og 0,4 mg\/dag eller placebo. Liraglutid 3,0 mg\/dag blev inkluderet til sammenligning. Ca. 100 deltagere blev inkluderet i hver aktiv behandlingsarm, og behandlingen blev kombineret med di\u00e6t og motion. Alle deltagere i studiet blev behandlet i 52 uger efterfulgt af en syvugers opf\u00f8lgningsperiode. Fra en gennemsnitsv\u00e6gt ved studiets start p\u00e5 omkring 111 kg og et BMI p\u00e5 ca. 39 kg\/m2 blev der observeret et v\u00e6gttab p\u00e5 op til 17,8 kg efter 52 ugers behandling med semaglutid.

In the trial, 957 people with obesity were randomised to treatment with doses of semaglutide between 0.05 to 0.4 mg\/day or placebo. Liraglutide 3.0 mg\/day was included for comparison. Approximately 100 people were included in each active treatment arm in combination with diet and exercise. All people in the trial were treated for 52 weeks followed by a 7-week follow-up period. From a mean baseline weight of around 111 kg and a body mass index of approximately 39 kg\/m2, a weight loss up to 17.8 kg was observed after 52 weeks of treatment with semaglutide. This corresponded to an estimated 13.8% weight loss compared to the weight loss of 2.3% achieved by diet, exercise and placebo alone, with all treatment arms adjusted for people discontinuing treatment in the study. The results from the liraglutide 3.0 mg treatment arm were broadly in line with previously reported data. Once-daily semaglutide had a well-tolerated safety profile, with the most common adverse events being gastrointestinal side effects. \"We are very excited about these strong results and the potential of semaglutide as a new treatment for people with obesity,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"We will now prepare the phase 3 programme with semaglutide to confirm these results.

The update is based on the results from the LEADER trial which investigated the long-term effects of Victoza\u00ae (liraglutide up to 1.8 mg) in people with type 2 diabetes, at high risk of major cardiovascular (CV) events. In the LEADER trial, Victoza\u00ae (liraglutide up to 1.8 mg) statistically significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (heart attack) and non-fatal stroke by 13% versus placebo, when added to standard of care. The overall risk reduction was derived from a statistically significant 22% reduction in cardiovascular death with Victoza\u00ae treatment versus placebo and non-significant reductions in non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke. The CHMP has recommended an update of the indication for Victoza\u00ae to reflect both glycaemic control and cardiovascular events as integral parts of type 2 diabetes treatment. \"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for people with type 2 diabetes,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"There remains an unmet medical need to further reduce cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes and we are very pleased that the CHMP has recommended the Victoza\u00ae label update based on the LEADER trial.\" The CHMP positive opinion for Victoza\u00ae is now referred to the European Commission, which grants approval in the EU, for final action on the proposed indication. Novo Nordisk expects to receive the European Commission decision for the Victoza\u00ae label update in the third quarter of 2017. About Victoza\u00aeVictoza\u00ae is a human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue with an amino acid sequence 97% similar to endogenous human GLP-1. Victoza\u00ae was approved in the EU in 2009 and is commercially available in more than 95 countries, treating more than 1 million people with type 2 diabetes globally. In Europe, Victoza\u00ae is indicated for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes to achieve glycaemic control as monotherapy, when metformin is considered inappropriate, and in combination with oral glucose-lowering medicinal products and\/or basal insulin when these, together with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control. In the US, Victoza\u00ae was approved in 2010 as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve blood glucose control in adults with type 2 diabetes. About the LEADER trialLEADER was a multicentre, international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the long-term (3.5-5 years) effects of Victoza\u00ae (liraglutide up to 1.8 mg) compared to placebo, both in addition to standard of care, in people with type 2 diabetes at high risk of major cardiovascular events. Standard of care was comprised of lifestyle modifications, glucose-lowering treatments and cardiovascular medications. LEADER was initiated in September 2010 and randomised 9,340 people with type 2 diabetes from 32 countries. The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of a composite cardiovascular outcome comprising cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke.

This update is based on the results from the LEADER trial which investigated the long-term effects of Victoza\u00ae in people with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. The CHMP has previously concluded that, although the Saxenda\u00ae dosing of liraglutide 3.0 mg was not investigated in the LEADER trial, the results would also be supportive for the assessment of Saxenda\u00ae for any potential cardiovascular risk. The Saxenda\u00ae label has been updated with immediate effect to reflect the primary outcome of the LEADER trial. In the LEADER trial, Victoza\u00ae (liraglutide 1.8 mg) statistically significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (heart attack) and non-fatal stroke by 13% versus placebo, when added to standard of care. The overall risk reduction was derived from a statistically significant 22% reduction in cardiovascular death with Victoza\u00ae treatment versus placebo and non-significant reductions in non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke. \"We are very pleased that data from the LEADER trial has been included in the Saxenda\u00ae label in Europe,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief scientific officer of Novo Nordisk. \"The LEADER trial showed that liraglutide is associated with significant cardiovascular risk reduction in people with type 2 diabetes. This is an important development for people with obesity in Europe living with weight-related comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease.\" On 25 October 2016, Novo Nordisk submitted an application to the EMA for including data from the LEADER cardiovascular outcomes trial in the product information of Victoza\u00ae. Novo Nordisk expects feedback from the EMA on the Victoza\u00ae application shortly. About Saxenda\u00ae Saxenda\u00ae (liraglutide 3 mg) is a once-daily glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue with 97% similarity to naturally occurring human GLP-1, a hormone that is released in response to food intake. Like human GLP-1, Saxenda\u00ae regulates appetite by increasing feelings of fullness and satiety, while lowering feelings of hunger and prospective food consumption, thereby leading to reduced food intake. As with other GLP-1 receptor agonists, Saxenda\u00ae stimulates insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. Saxenda\u00ae was evaluated in the SCALE (Satiety and Clinical Adiposity - Liraglutide Evidence) phase 3a clinical trial programme.

About Victoza\u00aeVictoza\u00ae (liraglutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg) is a human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue with an amino acid sequence 97% similar to endogenous human GLP-1. Victoza\u00ae was approved in the EU in 2009 and is commercially available in more than 95 countries, treating more than 1 million people with type 2 diabetes globally. In Europe, Victoza\u00ae is indicated for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes to achieve glycaemic control as monotherapy, when metformin is considered inappropriate, and in combination with oral glucose-lowering medicinal products and\/or basal insulin when these, together with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control. In the US, Victoza\u00ae was approved in 2010 as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve blood glucose control in adults with type 2 diabetes. About the LEADER trialLEADER was a multicentre, international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the long-term (3.5-5 years) effects of Victoza\u00ae (liraglutide 1.8 mg) compared to placebo, both in addition to standard of care, in people with type 2 diabetes with established cardiovascular disease. Standard of care was comprised of lifestyle modifications, glucose-lowering treatments and cardiovascular medications. LEADER was initiated in September 2010 and randomised 9,340 people with type 2 diabetes from 32 countries. The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of a composite cardiovascular outcome comprising cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke.

The trial demonstrated that Tresiba\u00ae met the primary endpoint of non-inferiority compared with insulin glargine U100 for major adverse CV events (MACE) with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.78; 1.06, p=0.209). Additionally, the findings for each component of MACE were consistent with the primary endpoint, including first occurrence of CV death (HR=0.96, 95% CI: 0.76; 1.21, p=0.714), non-fatal myocardial infarction (HR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.68; 1.06, p=0.150) or non-fatal stroke (HR=0.90, 95% CI: 0.65; 1.23, p=0.502).1 Results from the trial, involving 7,637 people with type 2 diabetes followed for approximately two years, were presented at the American Diabetes Association's 77th Scientific Sessions (ADA 2017) and also published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine.1 Results from the secondary endpoints of the trial showed a significant reduction in the rate of severe (40%) and nocturnal severe (53%) hypoglycaemia with Tresiba\u00ae vs. insulin glargine U100 (both p<0.001).* Additionally, post hoc analyses showed: similar levels of glycaemic control with an end of trial HbA1c estimated treatment difference of 0.01% (p=0.779) between the two treatment groups and significantly lower fasting plasma glucose levels with Tresiba\u00ae after 2 years vs. insulin glargine U100 (estimated treatment difference -7.2 mg\/dL, p<0.001).1 \"In the DEVOTE trial degludec demonstrated no increase in the risk of major cardiovascular events and significant reductions in the rates of severe and nocturnal severe hypoglycaemia compared to insulin glargine U100,\" said Dr Bernard Zinman of the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada and member of the DEVOTE Steering Committee. \"Risk of cardiovascular disease and hypoglycaemia are important concerns for those with type 2 diabetes and the results from DEVOTE add to the mounting evidence that will play an important role in treatment decisions.\" The safety profile of Tresiba\u00ae in DEVOTE was generally consistent with previous Tresiba\u00ae clinical trials.1 In DEVOTE, systematic collection of adverse events was limited to serious adverse events, adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation of investigational product (5.2% of patients in the Tresiba\u00ae arm and 5.8% of patients in the insulin glargine U100 arm), medication errors leading to serious adverse events and adverse events related to technical complaints. *Severe hypoglycaemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person, and nocturnal severe defined as between the hours of 00:01-05:59, inclusive.1 DEVOTE is a long-term, multi-national, randomised, double-blind and event-driven trial conducted to confirm the CV safety of Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) compared to insulin glargine U100. In the trial, 7,637 people (Tresiba\u00ae: n=3,818, insulin glargine U100: n=3,819) with type 2 diabetes at high risk of CV disease were randomised to treatment with either Tresiba\u00ae or insulin glargine U100 in vial in addition to standard of care.1 The primary endpoint in DEVOTE was time from randomisation to the first occurrence of a three-component composite CV outcome comprising CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. Secondary endpoints included severe hypoglycaemia, nocturnal severe hypoglycaemia, HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose.1 Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) is a once-daily basal insulin that provides a duration of action beyond 42 hours with a flat and stable glucose-lowering effect.2,3 It provides low within-day and day-to-day variability and a lower risk of overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia vs. insulin glargine U100.1,2 On occasions when administration at the same time of day is not possible, Tresiba\u00ae allows for flexibility in day-to-day dosing time with a minimum of eight hours between injections.2 Tresiba\u00ae received its first regulatory approval in September 2012 and has since been approved in more than 80 countries globally.

In the DEVOTE trial, the primary endpoint was achieved by demonstrating non-inferiority of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) with Tresiba\u00ae compared to insulin glargine U100. The trial thereby confirmed the results of the DEVOTE interim analysis submitted to the FDA in March 2015, on the basis of which Tresiba\u00ae and Ryzodeg\u00ae 70\/30 were approved in the US in September 2015. The primary endpoint of the DEVOTE study was defined as the MACE composite outcome of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke and showed a hazard ratio of 0.91 in favour of Tresiba\u00ae relative to insulin glargine U100, with no statistically significant difference between the two treatments. From a mean HbA1c baseline of 8.4%, the trial showed a similar reduction with Tresiba\u00ae compared to insulin glargine U100 with an end-of-trial treatment difference of 0.01 percentage points between the two treatment arms, thus fulfilling the requirements for objectively comparing hypoglycaemia rates between the two treatments. In the trial, Tresiba\u00ae demonstrated superiority on the secondary confirmatory endpoint of severe hypoglycaemia: 27% fewer patients in the Tresiba\u00ae treated group experienced an episode of severe hypoglycaemia, resulting in a 40% overall rate reduction of total episodes of adjudicated severe hypoglycaemia. Furthermore, patients in the Tresiba\u00ae treated group experienced a 53%* relative reduction in the rate of nocturnal severe hypoglycaemia. These differences were all statistically significant. Tresiba\u00ae appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile consistent with previous clinical studies conducted with Tresiba\u00ae. \"The risk of severe hypoglycaemia is a major cause for people with type 2 diabetes not reaching their treatment targets,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"However, with the DEVOTE data, we have demonstrated that the strong clinical profile of Tresiba\u00ae leads to a significant reduction in severe hypoglycaemia in people with type 2 diabetes.\" DEVOTE is a long-term, multi-centre, multi-national, randomised, double-blinded, parallel group and event-driven trial conducted to confirm the cardiovascular safety of Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) compared to insulin glargine U100. In the trial, 7,637 people with type 2 diabetes at high risk of cardiovascular disease were randomised to treatment with either Tresiba\u00ae or insulin glargine U100 in vial in addition to standard of care. The DEVOTE trial has been conducted in response to a Complete Response Letter received from the FDA in February 2013 requesting additional cardiovascular data from a dedicated cardiovascular outcomes trial before the review of the New Drug Applications for Tresiba\u00ae and Ryzodeg\u00ae 70\/30 could be concluded. Tresiba\u00ae and Ryzodeg\u00ae 70\/30 were approved in the US in September 2015 on the basis of an interim analysis of DEVOTE. Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) is a once-daily basal insulin that provides duration of action of at least 42 hours. Tresiba\u00ae is taken once daily, at any time of day.

DEVOTE er et randomiseret, dobbeltblindet og h\u00e6ndelsesdrevet langtidsstudie, der er gennemf\u00f8rt med det form\u00e5l at bekr\u00e6fte den kardiovaskul\u00e6re sikkerhed for Tresiba\u00ae sammenlignet med insulin glargin U100 givet som supplement til standardbehandling i mennesker med type 2-diabetes. I DEVOTE-studiet blev det prim\u00e6re m\u00e5l opfyldt, idet det viste ikke-inferi\u00f8ritet med hensyn til alvorlige kardiovaskul\u00e6re h\u00e6ndelser med Tresiba\u00ae sammenlignet med insulin glargin U100. Studiet bekr\u00e6ftede dermed resultaterne af interimanalysen af DEVOTE, som blev indsendt til de amerikanske sundhedsmyndigheder i marts 2015 og dannede grundlag for godkendelsen af Tresiba\u00ae og Ryzodeg\u00ae 70\/30 i USA i september 2015. Det prim\u00e6re endepunkt for DEVOTE-studiet var defineret som den f\u00f8rste forekomst af et sammensat kardiovaskul\u00e6rt endepunkt best\u00e5ende af kardiovaskul\u00e6rt d\u00f8dsfald, ikke-d\u00f8deligt myokardieinfarkt (hjerteanfald) eller ikke-d\u00f8deligt slagtilf\u00e6lde og viste en risikoratio p\u00e5 0,91 til fordel for Tresiba\u00ae i forhold til insulin glargin U100 med ingen statistisk signifikant forskel mellem de to behandlinger. Fra et gennemsnitligt langtidsblodsukkerniveau (HbA1c) ved studiets begyndelse p\u00e5 8,4% viste studiet en sammenlignelig reduktion med Tresiba\u00ae sammenlignet med insulin glargin U100 med en behandlingsforskel ved studiets afslutning p\u00e5 0,01 procentpoint mellem de to behandlingsgrupper. Kravene for objektivt at sammenligne forekomsten af hypoglyk\u00e6mi (lavt blodsukker) mellem de to behandlinger var dermed opfyldt. I studiet viste Tresiba\u00ae superioritet med hensyn til det bekr\u00e6ftende sekund\u00e6re endepunkt vedr\u00f8rende alvorlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi: 27% f\u00e6rre deltagere i gruppen, der blev behandlet med Tresiba\u00ae, oplevede en episode af alvorlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi, hvilket samlet set resulterede i en 40% reduktion i den samlede forekomst af episoder af adjudikeret alvorlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi. Endvidere oplevede deltagere i gruppen, der blev behandlet med Tresiba\u00ae, en 53%* relativ reduktion i forekomsten af natlig alvorlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi. Disse forskelle var alle statistisk signifikante. Tresiba\u00ae forekom at have en sikker og veltolereret profil, der var konsistent med tidligere kliniske studier gennemf\u00f8rt med Tresiba\u00ae. \"Risikoen for alvorlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi er en vigtig \u00e5rsag til, at mennesker med type 2-diabetes ikke n\u00e5r deres behandlingsm\u00e5l,\" siger Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, koncerndirekt\u00f8r for forskning og udvikling i Novo Nordisk. \"Men med resultaterne fra DEVOTE har vi vist, at den st\u00e6rke kliniske profil for Tresiba\u00ae f\u00f8rer til en signifikant reduktion i alvorlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi hos mennesker med type 2-diabetes.\" DEVOTE er et langtids-, multicenter-, multinationalt, randomiseret, dobbeltblindet, parallelgruppe- og h\u00e6ndelsesdrevet studie, som er gennemf\u00f8rt med det form\u00e5l at bekr\u00e6fte den kardiovaskul\u00e6re sikkerhed for Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) sammenlignet med insulin glargin U100.

In the trials, Tresiba\u00ae, the new-generation once-daily basal insulin, demonstrated clinically relevant reductions in hypoglycaemia compared with insulin glargine U100 in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. For the SWITCH 1 trial, the CHMP recommends the updated label to include results reflecting the significant reductions in hypoglycaemia. In the trial, adults with type 1 diabetes treated with Tresiba\u00ae vs. insulin glargine U100, both in addition to meal-time insulin aspart, experienced statistically significant reductions in hypoglycaemia, including 11% reduction of overall symptomatic hypoglycaemia (severe or blood glucose confirmed), 36% reduction in nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycaemia and 35% reduction in severe hypoglycaemia during the trial maintenance period. For the SWITCH 2 trial, the CHMP recommends the updated label to include results reflecting the significant reductions in hypoglycaemia. In the trial, adults with type 2 diabetes treated with Tresiba\u00ae vs. insulin glargine U100 experienced statistically significant reductions in hypoglycaemia, including 30% reduction in overall symptomatic hypoglycaemia (severe or blood glucose confirmed) and 42% decrease in nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycaemia, during the trial maintenance period. \"Following the submission of the application to the EMA in November 2016, we are very pleased to have received a positive opinion from the CHMP for the label update already at this point in time,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer at Novo Nordisk. \"An inclusion of the SWITCH trial results in the label will further support the clinical profile of Tresiba\u00ae\". The CHMP positive opinion is now referred for final action to the European Commission, which grants approval in the EU. Novo Nordisk expects to receive the updated marketing authorisation in the second quarter of 2017. About Tresiba\u00ae Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) is a once-daily basal insulin that provides duration of action beyond 42 hours with a flat and stable glucose-lowering effect. It provides low within-day variability and day-to-day variability and a lower risk of overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia vs. insulin glargine U100. On occasions when administration at the same time of day is not possible, Tresiba\u00ae allows for flexibility in day-to-day dosing time with a minimum of eight hours between injections. Tresiba\u00ae received its first regulatory approval in September 2012 and has since been approved in more than 80 countries globally. It was approved by the FDA in the United States on 26 September 2015. It is now commercially available in more than 50 countries. About SWITCH 1 and 2The two phase 3b, 2x32-week randomised, double-blind, crossover, treat-to-target trials were initiated to investigate the hypoglycaemia profile of Tresiba\u00ae compared to insulin glargine U100 in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. The primary endpoint was the number of severe or blood glucose confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes observed in participants. The two secondary endpoints included: the number of severe or blood glucose confirmed nocturnal episodes experienced in participants; and the proportion of people with one or more severe hypoglycaemic episodes. In SWITCH 1, 501 people with type 1 diabetes were randomised to crossover treatment with Tresiba\u00ae and insulin glargine U100 in combination with insulin aspart. In SWITCH 2, 721 people with type 2 diabetes were randomised to crossover treatment with Tresiba\u00ae and insulin glargine U100 in combination with oral antidiabetic drugs.

In the trial, more than 7,500 people with type 2 diabetes at high risk of major adverse cardiovascular events were treated for a period of approximately two years. The trial achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating non-inferiority of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) with Tresiba\u00ae compared to insulin glargine U100. The trial thereby confirmed the results of the DEVOTE interim analysis submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2015, on the basis of which Tresiba\u00ae and Ryzodeg\u00ae 70\/30 were approved in the US in September 2015. The primary endpoint of the DEVOTE study was defined as the MACE composite outcome of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke and showed a hazard ratio of 0.91 in favour of Tresiba\u00ae relative to insulin glargine U100, with no statistically significant difference between the two treatments. From a mean HbA1c baseline of 8.4%, the trial showed a similar reduction with Tresiba\u00ae compared to insulin glargine U100 with an end-of-trial treatment difference of 0.01 percentage-points between the two treatment arms, thus fulfilling the requirements for objectively comparing hypoglycaemia rates between the two treatments. In the trial, Tresiba\u00ae demonstrated superiority on the secondary confirmatory endpoint of severe hypoglycaemia: 27% fewer patients in the Tresiba\u00ae treated group experienced an episode of severe hypoglycaemia, resulting in a 40% overall reduction of total episodes of adjudicated severe hypoglycaemia. Furthermore, patients in the Tresiba\u00ae treated group experienced a 54% relative reduction in the rate of nocturnal severe hypoglycaemia. These differences were all statistically significant.* Tresiba\u00ae appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile consistent with previous clinical studies conducted with Tresiba\u00ae. \"We are very pleased that the DEVOTE study demonstrates the cardiovascular safety of Tresiba\u00ae and also confirms the hypoglycaemia benefit of this new generation insulin. Severe hypoglycaemia remains the most serious treatment risk related to insulin therapy. The DEVOTE results further strengthen the potential of Tresiba\u00ae to become the new standard of care within basal insulin therapy,\" says Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk.

DEVOTE is a long-term, multi-centre, multi-national, randomised, double-blinded, parallel group and event-driven trial conducted to confirm the cardiovascular safety of Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) compared to insulin glargine U100. In the trial, 7,637 people with type 2 diabetes at high risk of cardiovascular disease were randomised to treatment with either Tresiba\u00ae or insulin glargine U100 in vial in addition to standard of care. The DEVOTE trial has been conducted in response to a Complete Response Letter received from the FDA in February 2013 requesting additional cardiovascular data from a dedicated cardiovascular outcomes trial before the review of the New Drug Applications for Tresiba\u00ae and Ryzodeg\u00ae 70\/30 could be concluded. Tresiba\u00ae and Ryzodeg\u00ae 70\/30 were approved in the US in September 2015 on the basis of an interim analysis of DEVOTE. Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) is a once-daily basal insulin that provides duration of action of at least 42 hours. Tresiba\u00ae is taken once daily, at any time of day. Patients who miss or are delayed in taking their dose of Tresiba\u00ae can take their dose as soon as they remember, but ensuring there are at least eight hours between doses. Tresiba\u00ae received its first regulatory approval in September 2012 and has since been approved in more than 80 countries globally. It was approved by the US FDA in September 2015.

Alt dette s\u00f8rger programmet for.\" Et stort antal b\u00f8rn i programmet har nu f\u00e5et deres diabetes under kontrol, s\u00e5 de kan leve et godt og sundt liv. Indtil nu er der etableret 108 klinikker, og flere end 7.000 l\u00e6ger og andet sundhedspersonale er blevet undervist i diabetesbehandling. Udover at donere gratis insulin har Changing Diabetes\u00ae in Children-programmet til form\u00e5l at st\u00f8tte udviklingen af de lokale sundhedssystemer. Lars Rebien S\u00f8rensen, administrerende direkt\u00f8r for Novo Nordisk, siger: \"Udlevering af gratis medicin kan ikke i sig selv l\u00f8se komplekse sundhedsm\u00e6ssige udfordringer. Lige fra vi lancerede programmet, har vi derfor arbejdet t\u00e6t sammen med lokale partnere om at levere b\u00e6redygtige behandlingsl\u00f8sninger sammen med insulinen for at forbedre tilv\u00e6relsen for b\u00f8rn med type 1-diabetes b\u00e5de nu og i fremtiden.\" De globale partnere i programmet er Novo Nordisk, Roche, International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) og Verdensdiabetesfonden (WDF). I hvert af de ni lande, der allerede deltager (Cameroun, Den Demokratiske Republik Congo, Etiopien, Guinea, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Bangladesh og Indien), drives programmet som et privat-offentligt partnerskab med en gruppe lokale samarbejdspartnere. Landenes sundhedsministerier spiller en afg\u00f8rende rolle i at sikre, at Changing Diabetes\u00ae forankres i det eksisterende sundhedssystem.

The expansion sees five new countries join the programme; Cambodia, Ivory Coast, Myanmar, Senegal and Sudan. By 2020, more than 20,000 children over the course of 11 years will have benefited from the programme. Ten years ago, a child in Sub-Saharan Africa diagnosed with type 1 diabetes often had a life expectancy of less than a year[i]. In response, Novo Nordisk established the Changing Diabetes\u00ae in Children programme to support sustainable quality care and improved diagnosis of the condition. Since the start of the programme in 2009, 13,700 children in nine countries in Africa and South-East Asia have received free human insulin and access to diabetes care. \"The Changing Diabetes\u00ae in Children programme has been iconic,\" says Professor Azad Khan, president of the Diabetic Association of Bangladesh. \"It has changed the lives of children with type 1 diabetes in Bangladesh. Their survival depends on the supply of insulin as well as education on how to cope with diabetes, and the programme provides all of this.\" A large number of children enrolled in the program are experiencing good control and have a chance to lead healthier lives. To date, 108 clinics have been established and more than 7,000 healthcare professionals have been trained in diabetes care. In addition to providing access to insulin, the Changing Diabetes\u00ae in Children programme aims to support the development of sustainable healthcare systems. Lars Rebien S\u00f8rensen, president and CEO of Novo Nordisk, expressed: \"The provision of free medicine alone doesn't solve complex healthcare challenges. From the outset of this programme, we have therefore worked closely with local partners to deliver sustainable solutions alongside insulin to improve the lives of children with type 1 diabetes both now and in the future.\" About Changing Diabetes\u00ae in ChildrenThe global partners in the programme are Novo Nordisk, Roche, the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) and the World Diabetes Foundation (WDF). In each of the nine already established countries (Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Bangladesh and India), the programme is implemented as a public-private partnership with a group of local partners. The national ministries of health in these countries play a key role to ensure that Changing Diabetes\u00ae in Children is anchored within the existing healthcare system.

Studiet viste, at dag-til-dag-variationen var ca. fire gange lavere med Tresiba\u00ae end med insulin glargin U300. D\u00f8gnvariationen var ca. 40% lavere med Tresiba\u00ae, hvor den blodsukkers\u00e6nkende effekt var mere j\u00e6vnt fordelt over 24 timer sammenlignet med insulin glargin U300.1 Desuden viste resultaterne, at insulin glargin U300 var 30% mindre potent vurderet ud fra den totale blodsukkers\u00e6nkende effekt sammenlignet med Tresiba\u00ae.1 \"Store sammenligningsstudier er n\u00f8dvendige for at vurdere effekten og sikkerheden ved nye insuliner; men farmakodynamiske studier er ogs\u00e5 vigtige, fordi de hj\u00e6lper os til en bedre forst\u00e5else af de farmakologiske egenskaber. Jo mere stabil den blodsukkers\u00e6nkende profil er, jo nemmere er insulinen at titrere, og det kan bidrage til at neds\u00e6tte risikoen for hypoglyk\u00e6mi og hyperglyk\u00e6mi hos patienter med diabetes,\" siger dr. Tim Heise, chefforsker ved Profil Institut i Tyskland. Dette var et fase 1-, enkeltcenter-, dobbeltblindet overkrydsningsstudie gennemf\u00f8rt over to fors\u00f8gsperioder, hvor deltagere med type 1-diabetes blev tilf\u00e6ldigt fordelt til at modtage Tresiba\u00ae eller insulin glargin U300 i en dosis p\u00e5 0,4 U\/kg\/dag. I alt 57 deltagere gennemf\u00f8rte studiet. Begge behandlinger blev administreret \u00e9n gang dagligt i 12 dage, efterfulgt af en 7-21-dages periode, hvor deltagerne ikke modtog studiebehandling, f\u00f8r de blev krydset over til den anden behandling i yderligere 12 dage. For at vurdere den farmakodynamiske variation i den blodsukkers\u00e6nkende effekt for Tresiba\u00ae og insulin glargin U300 gennemgik hver deltager seks 24-timers blodsukker-clampfors\u00f8g (tre i l\u00f8bet af hver 12-dages fors\u00f8gsperiode) gennemf\u00f8rt ved steady state (hvor deltagernes blodsukker holdes stabilt).1 Tresiba\u00ae er en basalinsulin til dosering \u00e9n gang dagligt med en virkningsvarighed p\u00e5 mere end 42 timer.[2],[3] Det er vigtigt for mennesker med type 1- og type 2-diabetes at etablere en rutine for deres insulinbehandling, men i situationer, hvor det ikke er muligt at tage insulin p\u00e5 det s\u00e6dvanlige tidspunkt af dagen, giver Tresiba\u00ae mulighed for fleksibilitet med hensyn til injektionstidspunktet.2,[4],[5] Tresiba\u00ae blev godkendt af registreringsmyndighederne f\u00f8rste gang i september 2012 og er siden blevet godkendt i flere end 80 lande verden over.

Treatment with Tresiba\u00ae (0.4 U\/kg) resulted in lower day-to-day and within-day variability* in glucose-lowering effect, compared with insulin glargine U300 (0.4 U\/kg).1 The study showed that the day-to-day variability was approximately four times lower with Tresiba\u00ae than with insulin glargine U300. Within-day variability was approximately 40% lower with Tresiba\u00ae, with the glucose-lowering effect being more evenly distributed across 24 hours compared to insulin glargine U300.1 In addition, insulin glargine U300 showed a 30% lower potency assessed by the total glucose-lowering effect compared to Tresiba\u00ae.1 \"While large-scale head-to-head trials are needed to compare the efficacy and safety of new insulins, pharmacodynamic studies are important, as they enable us to better understand their pharmacological properties.

About the NN1250-4227 study This was a phase 1, single-centre, double-blind, two-period, cross-over trial, where people with type 1 diabetes were randomly assigned to receive Tresiba\u00ae or insulin glargine U300 at a dose of 0.4 U\/kg\/day. A total of 57 people completed the study. Both treatments were administered once daily for 12 days, followed by a 7-21 day period in which the participants received no study treatment, before being crossed over to receive the other treatment for a further 12 days. In order to assess the pharmacodynamic variability in the glucose-lowering effect of Tresiba\u00ae and insulin glargine U300, each participant underwent six 24-hour glucose clamps (three during each 12-day study period) performed at steady state (where glucose levels are stabilised in the participants).1 About Tresiba\u00aeTresiba\u00ae is a once-daily basal insulin that provides a duration of action beyond 42 hours.2,3 It is important for people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes to establish a routine for insulin treatment. On occasions when administration at the same time of day is not possible, Tresiba\u00ae allows for flexibility in day-to-day dosing time when needed.2,4,5 Tresiba\u00ae received its first regulatory approval in September 2012 and has since been approved in more than 80 countries globally.

In SWITCH 1, people with type 1 diabetes were randomised to cross-over treatment with Tresiba\u00ae and insulin glargine U100 respectively, both in combination with insulin aspart. During the study's maintenance period, people treated with Tresiba\u00ae on average had 11% fewer episodes of overall symptomatic blood glucose confirmed hypoglycaemia, 36% fewer episodes of nocturnal blood glucose confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia and 35% fewer episodes of severe hypoglycaemia. All of the above results were statistically significant and similar results were seen in the full treatment period. In SWITCH 2, people with type 2 diabetes were randomised to cross-over treatment with Tresiba\u00ae and insulin glargine U100 respectively, both in combination with oral antidiabetic drugs. During the study's maintenance period, people treated with Tresiba\u00ae on average had 30% fewer episodes of overall blood glucose confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia and 42% fewer episodes of nocturnal blood glucose confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia, both favouring Tresiba\u00ae over insulin glargine U100. Both observations were statistically significant and similar results were observed for the full treatment period. For severe hypoglycaemia there was a 46%, but not statistically significant, reduction of the episodes in the maintenance period, and a statistically significant 51% reduction of the episodes in the full treatment period for Tresiba\u00ae compared to insulin glargine U100. In both studies, the mean baseline for HbA1c was 7.6%, and both studies showed that Tresiba\u00ae was non-inferior in terms of HbA1c reduction compared to insulin glargine U100. This means that the requirements for objectively comparing hypoglycaemia episodes between the two treatments were fulfilled. In both studies, Tresiba\u00ae generally appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. \"With the submission of the SWITCH data to the EMA, we have now completed the regulatory submissions in both the EU and the USA. We believe that inclusion of the SWITCH trial results in the prescribing information for Tresiba\u00ae will provide healthcare professionals with important information to make an informed choice when prescribing basal insulin\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) is a once-daily basal insulin that provides a duration of action beyond 42 hours. It is important for people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes to establish a routine for insulin treatment. Tresiba\u00ae is taken once daily, at any time of day. Patients who miss or are delayed in taking their dose of Tresiba\u00ae can take their dose as soon as they remember, making sure there are at least eight hours between doses. Tresiba\u00ae received its first regulatory approval in September 2012 and has since been approved in more than 70 countries globally. It was approved by the FDA in the United States on 25 September 2015. About SWITCH 1 and 2 The two phase 3b, 2x32-weeks randomised, double-blind, cross-over, treat-to-target trials were initiated in January 2014 to compare the safety profile and efficacy of Tresiba\u00ae\u00a0and insulin glargine U100. In the trials, people were treated for a 16-week titration period followed by a 16-week maintenance period and subsequently switched to the comparator drug. The overall objective was to document the hypoglycaemia profile in type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, respectively. In SWITCH 1, 501 people with type 1 diabetes were randomised to cross-over treatment with Tresiba\u00ae\u00a0and insulin glargine U100 in combination with insulin aspart. In SWITCH 2, 721 people with type 2 diabetes were randomised to cross-over treatment with Tresiba\u00ae\u00a0and insulin glargine U100 in combination with oral antidiabetic drugs. On 23 September 2016, Novo Nordisk announced the submission of a supplemental application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for including data from the SWITCH trials in the label for Tresiba\u00ae.

Det viser resultater fra ACTION-studiet (Awareness, Care & Treatment In Obesity Management), der blev pr\u00e6senteret p\u00e5 Obesity Week 2016, den fjerde \u00e5rlige kombinerede kongres for American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery og The Obesity Society. ACTION er det f\u00f8rste landsd\u00e6kkende studie, der unders\u00f8ger barrierer for effektiv fedmebehandling ud fra forskellige perspektiver - de sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtiges, l\u00e6gernes og arbejdsgivernes. Studiet var tilrettelagt med henblik p\u00e5 at opn\u00e5 viden om, hvordan indsatsen kan forbedres i forhold til behandling af sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt, undervisning og st\u00f8tte til de n\u00e6sten 79 mio. mennesker i USA, der lever med sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt. Sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt blev anerkendt som en kronisk sygdom af American Medical Association i 2013.[1],[2] \"Sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt skal forst\u00e5s som en alvorlig, ofte progressiv sygdom, hvor der skal b\u00e5de forebyggelses- og behandlingsstrategier til for at f\u00e5 den under kontrol,\" siger dr. Lee Kaplan, leder af Obesity, Metabolism and Nutrition Institute ved Massachusetts General Hospital Weight Center og medlem af styregruppen for ACTION. \"ACTION-studiet er vigtigt, fordi det tydeligt viser de udfordringer, der skal l\u00f8ses, og fremh\u00e6ver, at det er ubetinget n\u00f8dvendigt, at mange forskellige parter arbejder sammen om at udvikle og gennemf\u00f8re effektive l\u00f8sninger.\" If\u00f8lge studiet er en af disse udfordringer, at de fleste mennesker med sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt (65%) opfatter overv\u00e6gt som en sygdom, men at hovedparten (82%) anser v\u00e6gttab for at v\u00e6re \"udelukkende\" deres eget ansvar. 73% oplyste, at de har dr\u00f8ftet v\u00e6gt med en l\u00e6ge, mens 36% svarede, at de ikke g\u00e5r til l\u00e6gen for at f\u00e5 hj\u00e6lp til v\u00e6gttab.[3] En anden v\u00e6sentlig barriere for behandling var if\u00f8lge studiet, at der ikke er en l\u00f8bende dialog mellem l\u00e6gen og den sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtige om v\u00e6gtregulering. Selvom 72% af l\u00e6gerne f\u00f8lte, at de havde et \"ansvar for at bidrage aktivt\" til patienters v\u00e6gttabsindsats, var kun 55% af de sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtige if\u00f8lge dem selv blevet diagnosticeret. Desuden svarede kun 16% af de sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtige, at de havde aftalt en opf\u00f8lgende samtale med deres l\u00e6ge efter den indledende samtale om v\u00e6gtregulering. Og selvom l\u00e6gerne sagde, at de havde det \"fint\" med at tale om v\u00e6gtregulering, blev deres indsats ofte nedprioriteret p\u00e5 grund af manglende tid.[4] Studiet fandt desuden, at kun 23% af de sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtige havde haft et v\u00e6gttab p\u00e5 10% i de seneste tre \u00e5r trods flere \"seri\u00f8se\" fors\u00f8g p\u00e5 v\u00e6gttab, og at kun 44% af dem var i stand til at opretholde v\u00e6gttabet i mere end et \u00e5r.4 Dataene indikerer, at initiativer, der \u00f8ger l\u00e6gernes forst\u00e5else for deres patienters opfattelse af situationen og muligg\u00f8r en bedre dialog om v\u00e6gtregulering, kan have en positiv effekt p\u00e5 v\u00e6gtreguleringsindsatsen.3,4 ACTION-studiet (Awareness, Care and Treatment In Obesity Management) er det f\u00f8rste landsd\u00e6kkende studie i USA, der skal unders\u00f8ge barrierer for v\u00e6gtregulering ud fra forskellige perspektiver - de sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtiges, l\u00e6gernes og arbejdsgivernes. Form\u00e5let med studiet er desuden at opn\u00e5 en viden, der g\u00f8r det muligt at samarbejde om at forbedre indsatsen i forhold til behandling af sv\u00e6r overv\u00e6gt, undervisning og st\u00f8tte til den overv\u00e6gtige.

The findings were presented at Obesity Week 2016, the fourth annual combined congress of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery and The Obesity Society. ACTION is the first national study to investigate barriers to effective obesity management from the perspective of people with obesity, healthcare professionals (HCPs) and employers in the US. The study was designed to generate insights to improve obesity care, education and support for the nearly 79 million people in the US living with obesity, a condition that was recognised as a chronic disease by the American Medical Association in 2013.1,2 \"Obesity must be understood as a serious, often progressive disease requiring both prevention and treatment strategies to bring it under control\" said Dr Lee Kaplan, director of the Obesity, Metabolism and Nutrition Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital Weight Center and ACTION steering committee member. \"The value of the ACTION study is that it clearly identifies the challenges that must be overcome, and underscores the critical need for multiple communities working together to develop and implement effective solutions.\" One such challenge, according to study findings, is that most people with obesity (PwO) (65%) perceived obesity as a disease; however, most (82%) considered weight loss to be \"completely\" their responsibility. While PwO (73%) reported that they had discussed weight with an HCP, 36% indicated they did not seek support from their HCP for weight loss.3 Another significant barrier to care revealed by the study was an inconsistent HCP-patient dialogue about weight management. Although HCPs (72%) felt they had \"a responsibility to actively contribute\" to patients' weight loss efforts, only 55% of PwO reported receiving an obesity diagnosis from an HCP. Also, only 16% of PwO reported having a follow-up appointment with their HCP following initial conversations about obesity management, and whereas HCPs said they were \"comfortable\" having obesity management conversations, their efforts were often deprioritised due to limited time.4 The study also found that despite several \"serious\" weight loss attempts, only 23% of PwO reported a 10% weight loss during the past three years, and of those, 44% maintained weight loss for more than one year.4 These data suggest that initiatives which foster greater understanding among HCPs of their patients' beliefs, and facilitate more robust dialogue about weight management, could positively impact obesity management efforts.3,4 About ACTIONThe \"Awareness, Care and Treatment In Obesity Management\" (ACTION) study is the first US nationwide study to investigate barriers to obesity management from the perspective of people with obesity, healthcare professionals and employers. In addition, the study aims to generate insights to guide collaborative action to improve obesity care, education and support. Sponsored by Novo Nordisk, the ACTION study was led by a multi-disciplinary steering committee comprised of representatives from The Obesity Society, the Obesity Action Coalition, and the Integrated Benefits Institute, as well as obesity experts in the fields of primary care, endocrinology, physiology and nursing. The study involved more than 3,000 people with obesity, 600 healthcare professionals and 150 employers in the United States. To learn more about the study, please visit www.ACTIONStudy.com. About obesityObesity is a disease that requires long-term management.2,5 It is associated with many serious health consequences and decreased life-expectancy.6,7 Obesity-related comorbidities include type 2 diabetes, heart disease, obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and certain types of cancer.6,8,9 It is a complex and multi-factorial disease that is influenced by physiological, psychological, environmental, socio-economic and genetic factors.10 The global increase in the prevalence of obesity is a public health issue that has severe cost implications to healthcare systems. In 2014, 13% of adults, or approximately 600 million adults, were living with obesity.11 _______________________  References 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

I studiet blev tre helbredstilstande, der hver is\u00e6r beskriver symptomer p\u00e5 postprandial hyperglyk\u00e6mi af varierende hyppighed og sv\u00e6rhedsgrad (mild, moderat og sv\u00e6r), m\u00e5lt blandt den almindelige befolkning i Storbritannien og mennesker med diabetes i Sverige ved hj\u00e6lp af Time Trade-Off (TTO)[*]-metoden1. Resultaterne viste f\u00f8lgende gennemsnitlige v\u00e6rdier for helbredstilstand, hvor 0 angiver d\u00f8d og 1 angiver optimalt helbred: TTO 0,89 og 0,76 for den milde tilstand, TTO 0,75 og 0,71 for den moderate tilstand og TTO 0,56 og 0,58 for den sv\u00e6re tilstand, henholdsvis blandt den almindelige befolkning i Storbritannien og blandt svenskere med type 1- og type 2-diabetes1. \"God blodsukkerkontrol kan ikke kun bestemmes ud fra procentdelen af patienter, der n\u00e5r deres behandlingsm\u00e5l for langtidsblodsukkeret m\u00e5lt som HbA1c.

Form\u00e5let med analysen var at kvantificere indvirkningen af m\u00e5ltidsrelateret blodsukkerkontrol p\u00e5 helbredsrelateret livskvalitet hos mennesker med diabetes, udtrykt som helbredsrelateret nyttev\u00e6rdi ved hj\u00e6lp af TTO-metoden (Time Trade-Off). I studiets f\u00f8rste del blev der gennemf\u00f8rt en indledende litteraturgennemgang, efterfulgt af interviews med mennesker med diabetes, klinikere og sygeplejersker for at identificere karakteristika for indvirkningen af symptomer p\u00e5 postprandial hyperglyk\u00e6mi af varierende sv\u00e6rhedsgrad og hyppighed.

Findings will be presented today at the 19th Annual European Congress of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) in Vienna, Austria. The study sought to evaluate the perceived impact of postprandial hyperglycaemia on people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Three health state descriptions characterising postprandial hyperglycaemia symptoms of varying frequency and severity (mild, moderate and severe) were evaluated using a Time Trade-Off (TTO)[*] approach by members of the general public in the UK and people with diabetes in Sweden1. Findings showed the following mean health state utility values, where 0 indicates death and 1 indicates full health: TTO 0.89 and 0.76 for the mild state, TTO 0.75 and 0.71 for the moderate state and TTO 0.56 and 0.58 for the severe state, among the UK general public and Swedish people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes respectively1. \"Good metabolic control cannot solely be indicated by the percentage of patients reaching their glycaemic targets measured as HbA1c. Also the glucose excursions and the degree of postprandial hyperglycaemia need to be addressed,\" said Professor Johan Jendle, \u00d6rebro University of Sweden and scientific secretary for the Swedish Society of Diabetology. \"Postprandial glucose control is important for the quality of life of people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\" Overall, the study indicates that increasing severity in postprandial hyperglycaemic symptoms is perceived to have significant negative consequences for the short-term HRQL of people with diabetes1. About the study1The aim of this analysis was to quantify the impact of PPG control on HRQL of people with diabetes, expressed as health utilities using a TTO approach. In the first stage of the study, an initial literature review was conducted, followed by interviews with people with diabetes, clinicians and nurses, to characterise the nature of impact of postprandial hyperglycaemic symptoms of varying severity and frequency. Based on these findings, three health state descriptions were drafted with mild, moderate and severe symptoms of postprandial hyperglycaemia. For the valuation part of the study, a total of 300 people, including 150 members of the UK general public and 150 Swedish people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, were recruited to take part in a face-to-face TTO interview, a standard technique used to determine a utility value for each of the three health states. Participants were asked to choose between living in the health state for a 10-year time frame or living in full health for a reduced amount of time. The study was funded by Novo Nordisk A\/S. About postprandial glucose (PPG) controlPost-meal or postprandial, glucose (PPG) is the level of blood glucose concentration measured 1-2 hours after eating. When PPG levels rise too high after eating, it is known as post-meal, or postprandial, hyperglycaemia. Postprandial hyperglycaemia is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, damage to eyes, impaired cognitive function (in people with type 2 diabetes) among other diabetes-related complications2,3. The longer time spent in a hyperglycaemic state, the worse overall blood glucose control. Achieving tight PPG control is important to achieve optimal blood glucose control, HbA1c targets4, and to reduce risk of short-term and long-term complications associated with hyperglycaemia5.

In September, Novo Nordisk announced that Lars Rebien S\u00f8rensen, president and chief executive officer, will retire from the company by the end of 2016. Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen, currently executive vice president and head of Corporate Development, will succeed him, effective 1 January 2017. In September, Novo Nordisk announced plans to reduce the workforce by approximately 1,000 employees of the 42,600 positions in the company's global organisation. For 2016, the range for sales growth is now expected to be 5-6%, and growth in adjusted operating profit is now expected to be 5-7%, both measured in local currencies. During 2016, the market environment in the USA has become significantly more challenging, negatively impacting future pricing for Novo Nordisk's products. Consequently, the preliminary outlook for 2017 in local currencies indicates low single-digit growth in sales and flat to low single-digit growth in operating profit. Furthermore, Novo Nordisk no longer deems it achievable to reach the operating profit growth target of 10%, set in February 2016. As a result, the target has been revised and Novo Nordisk is now aiming for an average operating profit growth of 5%. The two other long-term financial targets remain unchanged. Lars Rebien S\u00f8rensen, president and CEO: \"We have reassessed our long-term target for operating profit growth and our R&D strategy in the light of the challenging market environment in the USA. As a result, we are reducing our global cost base and parting company with some of our valued employees.

In the LEADER trial, Victoza\u00ae statistically significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (heart attack) and non-fatal stroke by 13% versus placebo, when added to standard of care. The overall risk reduction was derived from a statistically significant 22% reduction in cardiovascular death with Victoza\u00ae treatment versus placebo and non-significant reductions in non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke. The safety profile of Victoza\u00ae in LEADER was generally consistent with previous liraglutide clinical trials. \"Reducing the risk of cardiovascular death in people with type 2 diabetes remains a significant unmet need and it is encouraging that we now have the opportunity to help address this challenge,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"Victoza\u00ae is the first GLP-1 receptor agonist to show cardiovascular risk reduction in adults with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk and we look forward to working with the regulatory authorities as they review the data from the LEADER trial.\" About the LEADER trialLEADER was a multicentre, international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the long-term (3.5-5 years) effects of Victoza\u00ae (liraglutide up to 1.8 mg) compared to placebo, both in addition to standard of care, in people with type 2 diabetes at high risk of major cardiovascular events. Standard of care was comprised of lifestyle modifications, glucose-lowering treatments and cardiovascular medications. LEADER was initiated in September 2010 and randomised 9,340 people with type 2 diabetes from 32 countries. The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of a composite cardiovascular outcome comprising cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. About Victoza\u00aeVictoza\u00ae (liraglutide) is a human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue with an amino acid sequence 97% similar to endogenous human GLP-1. Victoza\u00ae was approved in the EU in 2009 and is commercially available in more than 85 countries, treating more than 1 million people with type 2 diabetes globally. In Europe, Victoza\u00ae is indicated for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes to achieve glycaemic control as monotherapy, when metformin is considered inappropriate, and in combination with oral glucose-lowering medicinal products and\/or basal insulin when these, together with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control. In the US, Victoza\u00ae was approved in 2010 as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve blood glucose control in adults with type 2 diabetes.

During the study's maintenance period, people treated with Tresiba\u00ae on average had 11% fewer episodes of overall symptomatic blood glucose confirmed hypoglycaemia, 36% fewer episodes of nocturnal blood glucose confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia and 35% fewer episodes of severe hypoglycaemia. All of the above results were statistically significant and similar results were seen in the full treatment period. In SWITCH 2, people with type 2 diabetes were randomised to cross-over treatment with Tresiba\u00ae and insulin glargine U100, respectively, both in combination with oral antidiabetic drugs. During the study's maintenance period, people treated with Tresiba\u00ae on average had 30% fewer episodes of overall blood glucose confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia and 42% fewer episodes of nocturnal blood glucose confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia, both favouring Tresiba\u00ae over insulin glargine U100. Both observations were statistically significant and similar results were observed for the full treatment period. For severe hypoglycaemia there was a 46%, but not statistically significant reduction of the episodes in the maintenance period, and a statistically significant 51% reduction of the episodes in the full treatment period for Tresiba\u00ae compared to insulin glargine U100. In both studies, the mean baseline for HbA1c was 7.6%, and both studies showed that Tresiba\u00ae was non-inferior in terms of HbA1c reduction compared to insulin glargine U100. This means that the requirements for objectively comparing hypoglycaemia episodes between the two treatments were fulfilled. In both studies, Tresiba\u00ae generally appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. \"Hypoglycaemia continues to be a real challenge for many people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We believe that inclusion of the SWITCH trial results in the prescribing information for Tresiba\u00ae will provide healthcare professionals with important information to make an informed choice when prescribing basal insulin\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. About Tresiba\u00ae Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) is a once-daily basal insulin that provides a duration of action beyond 42 hours. It is important for people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes to establish a routine for insulin treatment. Tresiba\u00ae is taken once daily, at any time of day. Patients who miss or are delayed in taking their dose of Tresiba\u00ae can take their dose as soon as they remember, making sure there are at least eight hours between doses. Tresiba\u00ae received its first regulatory approval in September 2012 and has since been approved in more than 70 countries globally. It was approved by the FDA in the United States on 25 September 2015. About SWITCH 1 and 2 The two phase 3b, 2x32-weeks randomised, double-blind, cross-over, treat-to-target trials were initiated in January 2014 to compare the safety profile and efficacy of Tresiba\u00ae\u00a0and insulin glargine U100. In the trials, people were treated for a 16-week titration period followed by a 16-week maintenance period and subsequently switched to the comparator drug. The overall objective was to document the hypoglycaemia profile in type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, respectively. In SWITCH 1, 501 people with type 1 diabetes were randomised to cross-over treatment with Tresiba\u00ae\u00a0and insulin glargine U100 in combination with insulin aspart. In SWITCH 2, 721 people with type 2 diabetes were randomised to cross-over treatment with Tresiba\u00ae\u00a0and insulin glargine U100 in combination with oral antidiabetic drugs.

For 2017, Novo Nordisk has completed the majority of formulary negotiations in the USA and average prices after rebates are expected to be moderately lower, while the market access for the Novo Nordisk products is expected to remain largely unchanged. Lars Rebien S\u00f8rensen, president and CEO: \"Overall, we are satisfied with the performance in the first six months of 2016 where Victoza\u00ae and Tresiba\u00ae continued to deliver strong sales growth and Region China improved faster than expected. In the USA, the market environment is becoming increasingly challenging and contract negotiations for 2017 have reflected an intensifying price competition.

IDegLira is a once-daily, single injection fixed combination of insulin degludec (Tresiba\u00ae) and liraglutide (Victoza\u00ae) for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. Based on the data contained in the New Drug Application (NDA) for IDegLira, the FDA asked the panel members to discuss whether Novo Nordisk has provided adequate evidence to establish the efficacy and safety profile of IDegLira for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. The recommendation for approval was based on data from clinical trials of IDegLira, including the DUAL phase 3 clinical trial programme, which involved more than 3,000 adults with type 2 diabetes. In addition to the DUAL clinical trial programme, both insulin degludec and liraglutide have been studied extensively in separate clinical trial programmes and the products are commercially available across the globe. \"The unanimous recommendation from the Advisory Committee marks an important step towards making IDegLira available to adults with type 2 diabetes in the US.

Nonacog beta pegol er et glykopegyleret rekombinant faktor IX-pr\u00e6parat med en signifikant forbedret farmakokinetisk profil, udviklet til behandling af h\u00e6mofili B. Registreringsans\u00f8gningen for nonacog beta pegol er baseret p\u00e5 resultaterne fra det kliniske udviklingsprogram 'paradigm', som omfattede 115 deltagere med sv\u00e6r eller moderat sv\u00e6r h\u00e6mofili B. Studierne viste, at nonacog beta pegol var virkningsfuldt til rutinem\u00e6ssig forebyggende behandling, behandling af bl\u00f8dningsepisoder samt ved kirurgiske indgreb hos voksne, unge og b\u00f8rn. Nonacog beta pegol forekom endvidere at v\u00e6re veltolereret, og der blev ikke identificeret sikkerhedsm\u00e6ssige problemer. Nonacog beta pegol har en fem gange l\u00e6ngere halveringstid sammenlignet med g\u00e6ngse faktor IX-produkter. Deltagere i paradigm-studiet opn\u00e5ede et h\u00f8jere faktor IX-niveau i kredsl\u00f8bet trods mindre hyppig dosering af nonacog beta pegol. \u00c9n ugentlig dosering p\u00e5 40 IU\/kg nonacog beta pegol opretholdt i fase 3-studierne et faktor IX-aktivitetsniveau p\u00e5 over 15%, reducerede medianv\u00e6rdien for den \u00e5rlige bl\u00f8dningsfrekvens til 1,0 og viste potentiale til at forebygge bl\u00f8dninger i s\u00e5kaldte target joints (led, der er s\u00e6rligt udsat for gentagne bl\u00f8dninger). Disse deltagere rapporterede desuden om signifikant forbedret livskvalitet i studiet. \"Med indsendelsen af registreringsans\u00f8gningerne i 2016 for vores langtidsvirkende faktor IX, er mennesker med h\u00e6mofili B b\u00e5de i EU og i USA kommet et skridt t\u00e6ttere p\u00e5 en ny behandlingsmulighed,\" siger Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, koncerndirekt\u00f8r i Novo Nordisk med ansvar for forskning og udvikling. \"Nonacog beta pegol har med sit h\u00f8je faktoraktivitetsniveau, den mindre hyppige dosering og den reducerede bl\u00f8dningsfrekvens potentiale til at forbedre livskvaliteten b\u00e5de for patienterne og deres familie.\" Nonacog beta pegol er et faktor IX-molekyle med forl\u00e6nget halveringstid, der er beregnet til substitutionsbehandling hos mennesker med h\u00e6mofili B. Halveringstiden er forl\u00e6nget ved hj\u00e6lp af glykopegylerings-teknikken - en ny tilgang indenfor h\u00e6mofili B, som allerede har vist sig sikker og virkningsfuld indenfor h\u00e6mofili A og andre behandlingsomr\u00e5der. Det kliniske udviklingsprogram paradigm for nonacog beta pegol er gennemf\u00f8rt blandt b\u00f8rn og voksne med sv\u00e6r eller moderat sv\u00e6r h\u00e6mofili B - i alt 115 tidligere behandlede patienter med sammenlagt mere end 10.625 dages eksponering for op til 3,3 \u00e5rs behandling med nonacog beta pegol. Paradigm 1, farmakokinetisk studie (16 deltagere behandlet) - et enkeltdosis-eskaleringsstudie, der unders\u00f8gte sikkerhed og farmakokinetik for nonacog beta pegol sammenlignet med markedsf\u00f8rte rekombinante og plasmabaserede faktor IX-produkter. Nonacog beta pegol viste op til to gange forh\u00f8jet genfindelse i blodbanen, h\u00f8jere aktivitetsniveau og en fem gange l\u00e6ngere halveringstid sammenlignet med eksisterende behandling. Paradigm 2, pivotalstudie (74 deltagere behandlet, inklusive en undergruppe af deltagere fra paradigm 1-studiet) - et 52-ugers enkeltblindet, randomiseret studie, der unders\u00f8gte sikkerhed, effekt og farmakokinetik hos voksne og unge ved rutinem\u00e6ssig forebyggelse og behandling af bl\u00f8dninger. Ved forebyggende behandling med 40 IU\/kg doseret \u00e9n gang ugentligt forekom nonacog beta pegol at have en sikker og veltolereret profil og viste en medianv\u00e6rdi for den \u00e5rlige bl\u00f8dningsfrekvens for spontane bl\u00f8dninger p\u00e5 0,0. Endvidere blev 97% af s\u00e5kaldte breakthrough bleeds (spontane bl\u00f8dninger under behandlingsforl\u00f8bet) stoppet, og 90% af s\u00e5kaldte target joints (led, der er s\u00e6rligt udsat for gentagne bl\u00f8dninger) blev ikke l\u00e6ngere klassificeret som s\u00e5dan. Paradigm 3, kirurgistudie (13 deltagere behandlet, inklusive en undergruppe af deltagere fra paradigm 2-studiet) - et dedikeret studie, der bekr\u00e6ftede sikkerhed og effekt under og efter st\u00f8rre kirurgiske indgreb. Hos alle deltagere var en enkelt dosis forud for operationen tilstr\u00e6kkeligt til at forebygge bl\u00f8dning, og der var ikke behov for at give yderligere doser p\u00e5 operationsdagen. Endvidere viste det sig, at tre doser var tilstr\u00e6kkelige til at opretholde h\u00e6mostase i de f\u00f8rste to uger efter operationen. Paradigm 4, forl\u00e6ngelsesstudie (71 deltagere, som tidligere var blevet behandlet i paradigm 2- eller paradigm 3-studiet) - et sikkerhedsstudie med l\u00e6ngere tids eksponering, der viste en veltolereret profil uden identifikation af inhibitorer (neutraliserende antistoffer) eller andre sikkerhedsm\u00e6ssige signaler. Paradigm 5, p\u00e6diatrisk studie (25 deltagere behandlet) - et 52-ugers enkeltgruppestudie, der unders\u00f8gte forebyggende behandling doseret \u00e9n gang ugentligt og behandling af bl\u00f8dningsepisoder hos tidligere behandlede b\u00f8rn i alderen 1-12 \u00e5r. Nonacog beta pegol forekom at have en sikker profil, og alle deltagere opretholdt et gennemsnitligt faktoraktivitetsniveau p\u00e5 over 15% \u00e9n uge efter dosering af 40 IU\/kg og en medianv\u00e6rdi for den \u00e5rlige bl\u00f8dningsfrekvens p\u00e5 henholdsvis 0,0 og 2,0 for b\u00f8rn i alderen 0-6 og 7-12 \u00e5r. Selskabsmeddelelse nr. 39 \/ 2016","415":"Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark, 16 May 2016 - Novo Nordisk today announced the submission to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the Biologics License Application for the approval of long-acting factor IX, nonacog beta pegol. Nonacog beta pegol is a glycopegylated recombinant factor IX with a significantly improved pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, developed for patients with haemophilia B. The filing of nonacog beta pegol is based on the results from the paradigm clinical trial programme which involved 115 patients with severe or moderately severe haemophilia B. Nonacog beta pegol was found to be efficacious in routine prophylaxis, treatment of bleeding episodes and surgery for adults, adolescents and children. Furthermore, nonacog beta pegol appeared to be well-tolerated and no safety concerns were identified. Compared to standard factor IX products, nonacog beta pegol has a five times longer half-life. Patients in the paradigm study achieved a higher level of factor IX in the circulation despite less frequent dosing of nonacog beta pegol. In the phase 3 trials, once-weekly administration of 40 IU\/kg nonacog beta pegol maintained factor IX activity levels above 15%, reduced the median annualised bleeding rate (ABR) to 1.0 and showed a potential to prevent bleeds in target joints. Furthermore, these patients reported a significant improvement in quality of life during the trial. \"With the regulatory filings in 2016 of our long-acting factor IX, people with haemophilia B in both the EU and the US are one step closer to having a new treatment option\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"With its high factor activity level, less frequent dosing and reduced bleeding rate, nonacog beta pegol has the potential to improve the quality of life for both patients and their families.\" Nonacog beta pegol is a factor IX molecule with an extended half-life intended for replacement therapy in patients with haemophilia B. Glycopegylation, the prolongation technology used for the half-life extension, is a novel approach in haemophilia B, already proven safe and efficacious in haemophilia A and other therapeutic areas. The paradigm clinical trial programme for nonacog beta pegol enrolled children and adults with severe or moderately severe haemophilia B. A total of 115 previously treated patients with a total of more than 10,625 exposure days for up to 3.3 years of treatment with nonacog beta pegol. The paradigm 1 PK trial (16 patients treated) - a single-dose escalation trial evaluating safety and PK of nonacog beta pegol compared with marketed recombinant and plasma-derived factor IX products. Nonacog beta pegol showed up to twofold increase in recovery, higher activity levels and a fivefold prolongation of half-life compared to existing treatment. The paradigm 2 pivotal trial (74 patients treated, including a subset of patients from the paradigm 1 trial) - a 52-week single-blinded randomised trial evaluating safety, efficacy and PK for adults and adolescents in routine prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds. When provided prophylactic at 40 IU\/kg weekly, nonacog beta pegol appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile and showed a median annualised spontaneous bleeding rate of 0.0. Furthermore, 97% of breakthrough bleeds were treated successfully and 90% of target joints no longer classified as such. The paradigm 3 surgery trial (13 patients treated, including a subset of people from the paradigm 2 trial) - a dedicated trial confirming safety and efficacy during and after major surgical procedures. In all patients, a single preoperative dose provided effective haemostatic coverage, and no patient required additional doses on the day of surgery. Additionally, three doses proved sufficient in maintaining haemostasis during the first two weeks following the procedure. The paradigm 4 extension trial (71 patients previously treated in the paradigm 2 or paradigm 3 trials) - a safety extension trial with longer-term exposure demonstrated a well-tolerated profile with no inhibitors or other safety signals identified. The paradigm 5 paediatric trial (25 patients treated) - a 52-week single-arm trial evaluating once-weekly prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding episodes in previously treated children 1-12 years of age. Nonacog beta pegol appeared to have a safe profile, and all patients maintained mean factor activity levels above 15% one week after dosing of 40 IU\/kg and a median ABR of 0.0 and 2.0 for children aged 0-6 and 7-12 years old respectively.

This double-blinded trial investigated the long-term cardiovascular and other safety outcomes of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg semaglutide compared with placebo, both in addition to standard-of-care. In the trial, approximately 3,300 people with type 2 diabetes were treated for 104 weeks. The trial achieved its primary endpoint of showing non-inferiority of major cardiovascular events (MACE) with semaglutide compared with placebo, as well as a statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular risk. In the trial, around 250 MACE were accrued. The primary endpoint of the study was defined as the composite outcome of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. The safety profile of semaglutide in SUSTAIN 6 was as expected and consistent with previous semaglutide clinical studies. \"We are very encouraged by the potential for reduction of CV risk in people with type 2 diabetes with semaglutide based on the results of SUSTAIN 6. In addition to the strong efficacy profile, we have also established the safety profile for semaglutide by concluding the six SUSTAIN trials\" says Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"With the strong results from SUSTAIN 6, we look forward to the regulatory filing of semaglutide.\" Novo Nordisk expects to file semaglutide for regulatory review in the US and EU in the fourth quarter of 2016. About semaglutide Semaglutide is a new glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue that can help people with type 2 diabetes achieve substantial improvement of blood glucose with a low risk of hypoglycaemia. In addition, semaglutide induces weight loss by decreasing appetite and food intake.

Cities Changing Diabetes er en fantastisk mulighed for os for at l\u00e6re mere om, hvad vi kan g\u00f8re for at bremse sygdommens fremmarch. Vi ser frem til at l\u00e6re af de erfaringer, andre af verdens storbyer har gjort sig, s\u00e5 vi kan skabe et Johannesburg, der er sundere at bo i, og hvor f\u00e6rre mennesker har risiko for at udvikle diabetes.\" Cities Changing Diabetes blev startet i Mexico City i marts 2014 af Novo Nordisk, University College London (UCL) og Steno Diabetes Center. Form\u00e5let med Cities Changing Diabetes er i f\u00f8rste omgang at kortl\u00e6gge problemet, derefter udveksle ideer og bud p\u00e5 l\u00f8sninger og til slut udarbejde konkrete handlingsplaner for de storbyer, der deltager i programmet. I november 2015 blev de f\u00f8rste resultater af partnerskabet pr\u00e6senteret p\u00e5 en stor konference i K\u00f8benhavn. De viste, at risikoen for diabetes i storbyer i h\u00f8jere grad end f\u00f8r antaget knytter sig til sociale og kulturelle faktorer1 - faktorer, som dels \u00f8ger indbyggernes risiko for at udvikle type 2-diabetes, og som dels g\u00f8r det mindre sandsynligt, at de bliver diagnosticeret, modtager behandling og bevarer en god sundhedstilstand. For eksempel viste resultaterne, at mange i Houston traditionelt forbinder diabetes med lavere samfunds\u00f8konomisk status, mens virkeligheden er, at alle uanset \u00f8konomisk form\u00e5en er s\u00e5rbare i forhold til at udvikle sygdommen. I Mexico City fandt man, at k\u00f8nsroller var med til at \u00f8ge risikoen for diabetes blandt kvinder, fordi de ofte tilsides\u00e6tter deres eget helbred og derfor ikke bliver diagnosticeret. David Napier, professor i medicinsk antropologi ved UCL og leder af det globale forskningsarbejde, forklarer: \"Vi fors\u00f8ger at hj\u00e6lpe byerne ved at se ud over de traditionelle biomedicinske risikofaktorer for udvikling af diabetes for at finde frem til, hvorfor risikoen er st\u00f8rre for mennesker i byerne. Samarbejdet med Johannesburg er af stor betydning for initiativet, fordi det er den f\u00f8rste by p\u00e5 det afrikanske kontinent, og fordi vi tror, initiativet vil kunne g\u00f8re en forskel for byens indbyggere.\" Initiativets f\u00f8rste fase har allerede i februar 2016 dannet grundlag for en beslutning i K\u00f8benhavn, som er en af byerne i partnerskabet, om at etablere et nyt diabetescenter. Centret skal forbedre adgangen til diabetesbehandling for alle borgere, herunder de befolkningsgrupper, der if\u00f8lge programmets forskningsresultater har stor risiko for at udvikle diabetes, og som er sv\u00e6re at komme i kontakt med. Foruden Johannesburg deltager Houston, Mexico City, K\u00f8benhavn, Shanghai og Tianjin i Cities Changing Diabetes-programmet.  Om cities changing diabetes Cities Changing Diabetes er et partnerskabsprogram, der skal tackle diabetesudfordringen i verdens storbyer. Programmet er lanceret af Novo Nordisk som reaktion p\u00e5 den kraftige stigning i forekomsten af diabetes i storbyer og er udviklet i samarbejde med University College London og Steno Diabetes Center samt en r\u00e6kke lokale partnere, herunder diabetes- og sundhedsorganisationer, bystyrer, forskningsinstitutioner, byudviklingseksperter (fra mange specialistomr\u00e5der) og civilsamfundsorganisationer. F\u00f8lgende byer har indtil nu tilsluttet sig: Mexico City, Houston, K\u00f8benhavn, Shanghai, Tianjin og Johannesburg.

The addition of the largest city in South Africa as a partner city means Cities Changing Diabetes now brings together six cities across four continents in the fight against urban diabetes. Johannesburg City Member of the Mayoral Council on Health and Social Development Ms Nonceba Molwele says: \"Diabetes is ranked 6th\u00a0among the top 10 leading causes of death in Johannesburg and represents a significant public health challenge here. Joining Cities Changing Diabetes is an exciting opportunity for us to learn more about what we can do to combat this growing condition. We look forward to learning from the experiences of other cities around the world, so that we can create a more liveable and healthy Johannesburg with fewer people at risk of developing diabetes.\" Cities Changing Diabetes was established in 2014 by founding partners Novo Nordisk, University College London (UCL) and Steno Diabetes Center. The programme aims to tackle the rise of diabetes in cities through three distinct but interconnecting phases: mapping, sharing and action. In November 2015, the partnership presented findings of first-of-its-kind research that found that diabetes vulnerability in cities is linked to a complex mix of\u00a0social and cultural factors1- responsible for both putting people at greater initial risk of developing type 2 diabetes and subsequently making them less likely to be diagnosed, receive treatment and maintain good health. For example the study findings showed that in Houston many people link diabetes with lower socio-economic status, while people of all economic classes are in fact vulnerable to the condition. In Mexico City, gender roles were linked to increased diabetes vulnerability among women, who sometimes went undiagnosed after neglecting their personal health. Global research lead David Napier, professor of Medical Anthropology, UCL explains: \"We are helping cities to look beyond traditional biomedical risk factors for diabetes to consider why it is that urban inhabitants are at increased risk of diabetes. Working with Johannesburg is significant for the programme as it will provide our first insights into urban diabetes in Africa and crucially, will enable the city to take action for the health of its citizens.\" The programme insights have already informed a decision in February 2016 by Cities Changing Diabetes partner city Copenhagen to establish a new diabetes centre. The centre will enable improved access to diabetes for all citizens including care for vulnerable, hard-to-reach populations identified by the programme's research efforts. In addition to Johannesburg, Houston, Mexico City and Copenhagen, the cities of Shanghai and Tianjin are sharing insights and taking action as part of the Cities Changing Diabetes programme.

The trial compared the addition of either Victoza\u00ae or placebo to standard of care and met the primary endpoint of showing non-inferiority as well as demonstrating superiority, with a statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular risk. The primary endpoint of the study was defined as the composite outcome of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. The superior reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events demonstrated by Victoza\u00ae was derived from all three components of the endpoint. The safety profile of Victoza\u00ae in LEADER was generally consistent with previous liraglutide clinical studies. \"People with type 2 diabetes generally have a higher risk of experiencing major adverse cardiovascular events. That's why we are very excited about the results from LEADER, which showed that Victoza\u00ae, in addition to helping people with type 2 diabetes control their blood sugar levels, also reduces their risk of major adverse cardiovascular events \", said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"LEADER is the largest and longest Novo Nordisk clinical trial to report to date, and we look forward to sharing the detailed results with the medical community and submitting the findings to the regulatory authorities.\" The detailed results are planned to be presented at the 76th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association in June 2016.

The trial was initiated in September 2010 and randomised 9,340 people with type 2 diabetes from 32 countries that were followed for 3.5-5 years. The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of a composite cardiovascular outcome comprising cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. About Victoza\u00ae Victoza\u00ae (liraglutide) is a human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue with an amino acid sequence 97% similar to endogenous human GLP-1. Victoza\u00ae was launched in the EU in 2009 and is commercially available in more than 80 countries with more than 3 million patient years of use in people with type 2 diabetes globally. In Europe, Victoza\u00ae is indicated for treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes to achieve glycaemic control in combination with oral glucose-lowering medicinal products and\/or basal insulin when these, together with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control. Victoza\u00ae was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2010, as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes.

Det prim\u00e6re m\u00e5l for studiet var defineret som et sammensat endepunkt best\u00e5ende af den f\u00f8rste forekomst af kardiovaskul\u00e6r d\u00f8d, ikke-d\u00f8deligt myokardieinfarkt eller ikke-d\u00f8deligt slagtilf\u00e6lde. Den signifikante reduktion af alvorlige kardiovaskul\u00e6re h\u00e6ndelser, der blev vist for Victoza\u00ae, hidr\u00f8rte fra alle tre komponenter i dette endepunkt. Sikkerhedsprofilen for Victoza\u00ae i LEADER var generelt konsistent med tidligere kliniske studier af liraglutid. \"Mennesker med type 2-diabetes har generelt en for\u00f8get risiko for alvorlige kardiovaskul\u00e6re h\u00e6ndelser. Det er derfor, vi er meget begejstrede for resultaterne fra LEADER, som viser, at Victoza\u00ae ikke bare hj\u00e6lper mennesker med type 2-diabetes med at regulere deres blodsukkerniveau, men ogs\u00e5 reducerer deres risiko for alvorlige kardiovaskul\u00e6re h\u00e6ndelser,\" siger Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, koncerndirekt\u00f8r for forskning og udvikling i Novo Nordisk. \"LEADER er det hidtil st\u00f8rste og l\u00e6ngste kliniske studie, Novo Nordisk har rapporteret resultater fra, og vi ser frem til at dele de detaljerede resultater med l\u00e6geverdenen og indsende konklusionen til de regulatoriske myndigheder.\" De detaljerede resultater vil efter planen blive pr\u00e6senteret p\u00e5 det 76. \u00e5rsm\u00f8de i den amerikanske diabetesforening, American Diabetes Association (ADA), i juni 2016.

Om LEADER LEADER er et internationalt, randomiseret, dobbeltblindet, placebokontrolleret multicenterstudie, der har unders\u00f8gt langtidsvirkningerne af Victoza\u00ae (1,2 og 1,8 mg) sammenlignet med placebo, begge givet som supplement til standardbehandling, i mennesker med type 2-diabetes med h\u00f8j risiko for kardiovaskul\u00e6re h\u00e6ndelser. Studiet blev p\u00e5begyndt i september 2010 og randomiserede 9.340 mennesker med type 2-diabetes fra 32 lande, som blev fulgt i 3,5 til 5 \u00e5r. Det prim\u00e6re m\u00e5l var den f\u00f8rste forekomst af et sammensat kardiovaskul\u00e6rt endepunkt best\u00e5ende af kardiovaskul\u00e6r d\u00f8d, ikke-d\u00f8deligt myokardieinfarkt eller ikke-d\u00f8deligt slagtilf\u00e6lde. Om Victoza\u00ae Victoza\u00ae (liraglutid) er en human GLP-1-analog (glukagonlignende peptid-1) med en aminosyresekvens, der har 97% lighed med det GLP-1, kroppen selv producerer. Victoza\u00ae blev lanceret i EU i 2009 og er i dag p\u00e5 markedet i flere end 80 lande; produktet har v\u00e6ret anvendt til behandling af mennesker med type 2-diabetes i mere end tre\u00a0mio. patient\u00e5r globalt. I Europa er Victoza\u00ae godkendt til regulering af blodsukkerniveauet hos voksne med type 2-diabetes som till\u00e6gsbehandling til diabetesl\u00e6gemidler i tabletform og\/eller basalinsulin, n\u00e5r blodsukkeret ikke kan reguleres tilstr\u00e6kkeligt med disse l\u00e6gemidler sammen med motion og di\u00e6t. Victoza\u00ae blev godkendt af de amerikanske sundhedsmyndigheder, FDA, i 2010 som supplement til di\u00e6t og motion med det form\u00e5l at forbedre blodsukkerreguleringen hos voksne med type 2-diabetes Yderligere information Selskabsmeddelelse nr. 20 \/ 2016","446":"Bagsv\u00e6rd, den 23. februar 2016 - Novo Nordisk offentligg\u00f8r i dag de overordnede resultater fra SUSTAIN5, det femte fase 3a-studie med semaglutid. Semaglutid er en ny GLP-1-analog, som doseres ved injektion i underhuden (subkutant) \u00e9n gang ugentligt i SUSTAIN-studierne. Det dobbeltblindede studie unders\u00f8gte effekt og sikkerhed for 0,5 mg og 1,0 mg semaglutid sammenlignet med placebo som till\u00e6gsbehandling til basalinsulin alene eller basalinsulin i kombination med metformin, efter 30 ugers behandling hos 397 deltagere med type 2-diabetes. Studiet opfyldte succesfuldt sit m\u00e5l, idet det viste, at deltagere, som blev behandlet med 0,5 mg eller 1,0 mg semaglutid, fra et gennemsnitligt langtidsblodsukkerniveau (HbA1c) p\u00e5 8,4% ved studiets begyndelse opn\u00e5ede en statistisk signifikant og st\u00f8rre forbedring i HbA1c p\u00e5 henholdsvis 1,4% og 1,8% sammenlignet med en forbedring i HbA1c p\u00e5 0,1% med placebo. Endvidere var insulindosis ved studiets afslutning reduceret med henholdsvis 10% og 15% for deltagere i behandling med 0,5 mg og 1,0 mg semaglutid, mod 3% for placebogruppen. 61% af deltagere, som blev behandlet med 0,5 mg semaglutid, og 79% af deltagere, som fik 1,0 mg semaglutid, n\u00e5ede behandlingsm\u00e5let om HbA1c under 7% som fastsat af American Diabetes Association (ADA) og European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), mod 11% af dem, som blev behandlet med placebo. Fra en gennemsnitsv\u00e6gt p\u00e5 92 kg ved studiets begyndelse opn\u00e5ede deltagere i behandling med 0,5 mg og 1,0 mg semaglutid et statistisk signifikant og st\u00f8rre v\u00e6gttab p\u00e5 henholdsvis 3,7 kg og 6,4 kg sammenlignet med et v\u00e6gttab p\u00e5 1,4 kg hos deltagere i behandling med placebo. Semaglutid forekom i studiet at have en sikker og veltolereret profil. Den mest almindelige bivirkning var kvalme. Kvalme blev rapporteret hos 11% af deltagere i behandling med 0,5 mg semaglutid og hos 17% af deltagere i behandling med 1,0 mg semaglutid, mod 5% af deltagere i behandling med placebo. Alvorlig eller symptomatisk hypoglyk\u00e6mi bekr\u00e6ftet ved blodsukkerm\u00e5ling s\u00e5s hos 8% og 11% af deltagere i behandling med henholdsvis 0,5 mg eller 1,0 mg semaglutid \u00e9n gang ugentligt, mod 5% i placebogruppen.

Yderligere information  Selskabsmeddelelse nr. 18 \/ 2016","447":"Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark, 23 February 2016 - Novo Nordisk today announced the headline results from the fifth phase 3a trial for semaglutide, SUSTAIN5. Semaglutide is a new GLP-1 analogue, which in the SUSTAIN trials is administered subcutaneously once weekly. The double-blinded trial investigated the efficacy and safety of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg semaglutide compared with placebo as add-on to basal insulin alone or basal insulin in combination with metformin, after 30 weeks of treatment in 397 people with type 2 diabetes. The trial successfully achieved its objective by demonstrating that people treated with 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg semaglutide achieved a statistically significant and superior improvement in HbA1c of 1.4% and 1.8% respectively, from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.4%, compared with an improvement in HbA1c of 0.1% with placebo. Additionally, the end of trial insulin dose for people treated with 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg semaglutide was reduced by 10% and 15% respectively, compared with 3% for the placebo group. 61% of the people treated with 0.5 mg semaglutide and 79% of the people treated with 1.0 mg semaglutide achieved the treatment target of HbA1c below 7% set by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), compared with 11% of the people treated with placebo. From a mean baseline body weight of 92 kg, people treated with 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg semaglutide experienced a statistically significant and superior weight loss of 3.7 kg and 6.4 kg respectively, compared with a weight loss of 1.4 kg for people treated with placebo. In the trial, semaglutide appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. The most common adverse event was nausea. Nausea was reported by 11% of the people treated with 0.5 mg semaglutide and by 17% of the people treated with 1.0 mg semaglutide, compared with 5% of people treated with placebo. Severe or blood glucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia was experienced by 8% and 11% of people treated with 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg once-weekly semaglutide respectively, compared with 5% in the placebo group. The discontinuation rate due to adverse events was 5% and 6% for people treated with 0.5 mg semaglutide and 1.0 mg semaglutide respectively, compared to 1% for people treated with placebo. \"We are excited about the results of SUSTAIN 5, showing superior efficacy in glycaemic control and weight loss with semaglutide administered once-weekly in patients inadequately controlled on basal insulin\" says Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"The results from the first five SUSTAIN trials support the potential for broad usage of semaglutide in people with type 2 diabetes, as results have been consistent when exploring people with both early onset as well as late stage type 2 diabetes.\" Novo Nordisk expects to announce headline results of the final SUSTAIN trial, SUSTAIN 6 in the first half of 2016. Semaglutide is a new glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue that can help people with type 2 diabetes achieve substantial improvement of blood glucose with a low risk of hypoglycaemia. In addition, semaglutide induces weight loss by decreasing appetite and food intake. Semaglutide administered subcutaneously once weekly is in phase 3 development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, semaglutide is being developed in an oral tablet version for treatment of type 2 diabetes as well as once-daily subcutaneous versions for treatment of type 2 diabetes and weight management. About the SUSTAIN clinical programme The SUSTAIN programme is a phase 3 clinical programme comprising six global trials of semaglutide administered subcutaneously once weekly encompassing more than 7,000 people with type 2 diabetes. SUSTAIN 1 - a 30-week efficacy and safety trial of semaglutide versus placebo in 388 drug-na\u00efve people with type 2 diabetes. SUSTAIN 2 - a 56-week efficacy and safety trial of semaglutide versus sitagliptin once-daily as add-on to metformin and\/or TZD in 1,231 people with type 2 diabetes. SUSTAIN 3 - a 56-week efficacy and safety trial of semaglutide versus 2.0 mg exenatide once-weekly as add-on to 1-2 oral antidiabetic drugs in 813 people with type 2 diabetes.

SUSTAIN 6 - a 2-year trial not yet reported to evaluate cardiovascular and other long-term outcomes with semaglutide in 3,297 people with type 2 diabetes.  For further information Company announcement No 18 \/ 2016","448":"Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark, 23 February 2016 - Novo Nordisk today announced the headline results from SWITCH 1, the second of two 2x32-weeks randomised, double-blind, cross-over, treat-to-target trials, comparing the safety and efficacy of Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) and Lantus\u00ae (insulin glargine U100). The overall purpose of the trial was to compare the hypoglycaemia occurrence in people with type 1 diabetes treated with Tresiba\u00ae or insulin glargine. In the trial, 501 people with type 1 diabetes were randomised to cross-over treatment with Tresiba\u00ae and insulin glargine U100 in combination with insulin aspart. The timing of the daily injections of both Tresiba\u00ae and insulin glargine was randomised equally to take place either in the morning or evening. The primary end-point of the trial was the number of treatment emergent severe or blood glucose confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia episodes during the maintenance period (ie after 16 weeks of treatment) in each treatment period. From a mean baseline of 7.6%, the trial showed non-inferiority in HbA1c reduction for Tresiba\u00ae compared to insulin glargine, thus fulfilling the requirements for objectively comparing hypoglycaemia rates between the two treatments. Likewise, the end-of-trial insulin doses were similar at the end of treatment in the two treatment periods. The trial met the primary end-point by demonstrating non-inferiority in the rate of severe or blood glucose confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia of Tresiba\u00ae compared to insulin glargine. The observed rate was 2,201 events per 100 patient years exposed to Tresiba\u00ae and 2,463 events per 100 patient years exposed to insulin glargine during the maintenance period, corresponding to a statistically significant reduction of 11%. Similarly, non-inferiority was demonstrated for the rate of severe or blood glucose confirmed symptomatic nocturnal hypoglycaemia in the maintenance period. The observed rate of severe or blood glucose confirmed symptomatic nocturnal hypoglycaemia was 277 events per 100 patient years exposed to Tresiba\u00ae and 429 events per 100 patient years exposed to insulin glargine, corresponding to a statistically significant 36% reduction with Tresiba\u00ae compared to insulin glargine. Finally, superiority was demonstrated for the confirmatory secondary endpoint of proportions of subjects experiencing severe hypoglycaemia during the maintenance period. The proportion of patients experiencing severe hypoglycaemia was 10% for Tresiba\u00ae and 17% for insulin glargine, corresponding to a statistically significant reduction with Tresiba\u00ae compared to insulin glargine. The rates of severe hypoglycaemia were 69 and 92 events per 100 patient years exposed, respectively, corresponding to a statistically significant 35% reduction. All of the above analyses showed similar results for the total treatment period. In the trial, Tresiba\u00ae appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. Adverse events were comparable between the two treatment arms. The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections and hypoglycaemia. \"We are very excited about these trial results, which document that Tresiba\u00ae also in people with type 1 diabetes significantly reduces the risk of hypoglycaemia compared to insulin glargine\" says Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"We expect to initiate filing of the data from the SWITCH trials with regulatory authorities in Q3 2016 with the aim of updating the label for Tresiba\u00ae\".

About SWITCH 1 and 2 The two 2x32-weeks randomised, double-blind, cross-over, treat-to-target trials were initiated in January 2014 with the purpose of comparing the safety and efficacy of Tresiba\u00ae and Lantus\u00ae (insulin glargine U100). The overall purpose of the trials is to document the hypoglycaemia profile in type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes respectively, compared to insulin glargine U100. In SWITCH 1, 501 people with type 1 diabetes were randomised to cross-over treatment with Tresiba\u00ae and insulin glargine U100 in combination with insulin aspart. In SWITCH 2, 721 people with type 2 diabetes were randomised to cross-over treatment with Tresiba\u00ae and insulin glargine U100 in combination with oral antidiabetics.

Det overordnede form\u00e5l med studiet var at sammenligne forekomsten af hypoglyk\u00e6mi (lavt blodsukker) hos mennesker med type 1-diabetes, der blev behandlet med Tresiba\u00ae eller insulin glargin. I dette studie blev 501 mennesker med type 1-diabetes randomiseret til cross-over-behandling med Tresiba\u00ae og insulin glargin U100 i kombination med insulin aspart. Timingen af de daglige injektioner af b\u00e5de Tresiba\u00ae og insulin glargin blev ved randomisering ligeligt fordelt til at finde sted enten morgen eller aften. Studiets prim\u00e6re m\u00e5l var antallet af episoder af alvorlig eller symptomatisk hypoglyk\u00e6mi bekr\u00e6ftet ved blodsukkerm\u00e5ling, der opstod i forbindelse med behandlingen i vedligeholdelsesperioden (dvs. efter 16 ugers behandling) i hver enkelt behandlingsperiode. Fra et gennemsnitligt udgangspunkt p\u00e5 7,6% (baseline) viste studiet ikke-inferi\u00f8ritet med hensyn til reduktion af langtidsblodsukkerniveauet (HbA1c)for Tresiba\u00ae sammenlignet med insulin glargin og opfyldte dermed kravene for objektivt at sammenligne forekomsten af hypoglyk\u00e6mi mellem de to behandlinger. Ligeledes var insulindoserne ved studiets afslutning sammenlignelige, n\u00e5r behandlingen i de to behandlingsperioder sluttede. Studiet opfyldte sit prim\u00e6re m\u00e5l, idet det viste ikke-inferi\u00f8ritet med hensyn til forekomsten af alvorlig eller symptomatisk hypoglyk\u00e6mi bekr\u00e6ftet ved blodsukkerm\u00e5ling for Tresiba\u00ae sammenlignet med insulin glargin. Den observerede forekomst var 2.201 episoder pr. 100 patient\u00e5rs eksponering for Tresiba\u00ae og 2.463 episoder pr. 100 patient\u00e5rs eksponering for insulin glargin i vedligeholdelsesperioden, svarende til en statistisk signifikant reduktion p\u00e5 11%. Tilsvarende blev der vist ikke-inferi\u00f8ritet for forekomsten af alvorlig eller symptomatisk natlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi bekr\u00e6ftet ved blodsukkerm\u00e5ling i vedligeholdelsesperioden. Den observerede forekomst af alvorlig eller symptomatisk natlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi bekr\u00e6ftet ved blodsukkerm\u00e5ling var 277 episoder pr. 100 patient\u00e5rs eksponering for Tresiba\u00ae og 429 episoder pr. 100 patient\u00e5rs eksponering for insulin glargin, svarende til en statistisk signifikant reduktion p\u00e5 36% med Tresiba\u00ae sammenlignet med insulin glargin.

Adjusted for the partial divestment of NNIT, net profit and diluted earnings per share increased by 22% and 25% respectively. In 2015, Novo Nordisk achieved its four long-term financial targets established in January 2013 and consequently, the Board of Directors has approved three updated long-term financial targets to guide Novo Nordisk's performance. The target for operating profit growth has now been set at 10%, whereas no target for operating margin development has been established, as the operating margin is expected to stay at the current level around 44%. The targets for operating profit after tax to net operating assets and cash to earnings remain unchanged at 125% and 90% respectively. For 2016, sales growth is expected to be 5-9% measured in local currencies. Growth in operating profit is also expected to be 5-9% measured in local currencies, adjusted for the non-recurring impact of the partial divestment of NNIT and the income related to the out-licensing of assets for inflammatory disorders, both in 2015. Growth reported in DKK, for both items, is expected to be around 1 percentage point lower than the local currency levels.

The overall purpose of the trial was to compare the hypoglycaemia occurrence in people with type 2 diabetes treated with Tresiba\u00ae or insulin glargine. In the trial, 721 people with type 2 diabetes were randomised to cross-over treatment with Tresiba\u00ae and insulin glargine in combination with metformin. The timing of the daily injections of both Tresiba\u00ae and insulin glargine was randomised equally to take place either in the morning or evening. The primary end-point of the trial was the number of treatment emergent severe or blood glucose confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia episodes during the maintenance period (ie after 16 weeks of treatment) in each treatment period. From a mean baseline of 7.6%, the trial showed non-inferiority in HbA1c reduction of Tresiba\u00ae compared to insulin glargine, thus fulfilling the requirements for objectively comparing hypoglycaemia rates between the two treatments. Likewise, the end-of-trial insulin doses were similar at the end of treatment in the two treatment periods. The observed rate of severe or blood glucose confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia was 186 events per 100 patient years exposed to Tresiba\u00ae and 265 events per 100 patient years exposed to insulin glargine during the maintenance period. This reduction was statistically significant, and the trial thus met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a reduction of 30% when people were treated with Tresiba\u00ae compared to insulin glargine. The observed rate of severe or blood glucose symptomatic nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia in the maintenance period was 55 events per 100 patient years exposed to Tresiba\u00ae and 94 events per 100 patient years exposed to insulin glargine, corresponding to a 42% reduction with Tresiba\u00ae compared to insulin glargine and showing statistical significance on this confirmatory secondary end-point. The confirmatory secondary endpoint of proportions of subjects experiencing severe hypoglycaemia during the maintenance period did not reach statistical significance.\u00a0However, the supportive end-point, rate of severe hypoglycaemia, showed a 46% reduction with Tresiba\u00ae in the maintenance period and a statistical significant reduction of 51% with Tresiba\u00ae in the full treatment period. In the trial, Tresiba\u00ae appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. Adverse events were comparable between the two treatment arms. The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections. \"We are excited about these trial results, which in a blinded setting confirm the significant reduction in the risk of hypoglycaemia for Tresiba\u00ae compared to insulin glargine\" says Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"We look forward to reporting the outcome of the SWITCH 1 trial in people with type 1 diabetes and to evaluating the results from both trials\". Novo Nordisk expects to announce headline results of SWITCH 1 later in the first quarter of 2016. About SWITCH 1 and 2 The two 2x32-weeks randomised, double-blind, cross-over, treat-to-target trials were initiated in January 2014 with purpose of comparing the safety and efficacy of Tresiba\u00ae and insulin glargine. The overall purpose of the trials is to document the hypoglycaemia profile in type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes respectively, compared to insulin glargine. In SWITCH 1, 501 people with type 1 diabetes were randomised to crossover treatment with Tresiba\u00ae and insulin glargine in combination with insulin aspart. In SWITCH 2, 721 people with type 2 diabetes were randomised to crossover treatment with Tresiba\u00ae and insulin glargine in combination with oral antidiabetics.

Det overordnede form\u00e5l med studiet var at sammenligne forekomsten af hypoglyk\u00e6mi (lavt blodsukker) i mennesker med type 2-diabetes, der blev behandlet med Tresiba\u00ae eller insulin glargin. I studiet blev 721 mennesker med type 2-diabetes randomiseret til cross-over-behandling med Tresiba\u00ae og insulin glargin i kombination med metformin. Timingen af de daglige injektioner af b\u00e5de Tresiba\u00ae og insulin glargin blev ved randomisering ligeligt fordelt til at finde sted enten morgen eller aften. Studiets prim\u00e6re m\u00e5l var antallet af episoder af alvorlig eller symptomatisk hypoglyk\u00e6mi bekr\u00e6ftet ved blodsukkerm\u00e5ling, der opstod i forbindelse med behandlingen i vedligeholdelsesperioden (dvs. efter 16 ugers behandling) i hver enkelt behandlingsperiode. Fra et gennemsnitligt udgangspunkt p\u00e5 7,6% (baseline) viste studiet ikke-inferi\u00f8ritet med hensyn til reduktion af langtidsblodsukkerniveauet (HbA1c)for Tresiba\u00ae sammenlignet med insulin glargin og opfyldte dermed kravene for objektivt at sammenligne forekomsten af hypoglyk\u00e6mi mellem de to behandlinger. Ligeledes var insulindoserne ved studiets afslutning sammenlignelige, n\u00e5r behandlingen i de to behandlingsperioder sluttede. Den observerede forekomst af alvorlig eller symptomatisk hypoglyk\u00e6mi bekr\u00e6ftet ved blodsukkerm\u00e5ling var 186 episoder pr. 100 patient\u00e5rs eksponering for Tresiba\u00ae og 265 episoder pr. 100 patient\u00e5rs eksponering for insulin glargin i vedligeholdelsesperioden. Denne reduktion var statistisk signifikant, og studiet opfyldte dermed sit prim\u00e6re m\u00e5l, idet det viste en reduktion p\u00e5 30%, n\u00e5r deltagerne blev behandlet med Tresiba\u00ae,sammenlignet med insulin glargin. Den observerede forekomst af alvorlig eller symptomatisk natlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi bekr\u00e6ftet ved blodsukkerm\u00e5ling i vedligeholdelsesperioden var 55 episoder pr. 100 patient\u00e5rs eksponering for Tresiba\u00ae og 94 episoder pr. 100 patient\u00e5rs eksponering for insulin glargin, svarende til en 42% reduktion med Tresiba\u00ae sammenlignet med insulin glargin, og viste dermed statistisk signifikans for dette bekr\u00e6ftende sekund\u00e6re m\u00e5l. Det bekr\u00e6ftende sekund\u00e6re m\u00e5l vedr\u00f8rende andelen af deltagere, der oplevede alvorlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi i vedligeholdelsesperioden, n\u00e5ede ikke statistisk signifikans. Imidlertid viste det underst\u00f8ttende m\u00e5l vedr\u00f8rende forekomst af alvorlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi en 46% reduktion med Tresiba\u00ae i vedligeholdelsesperioden og en statistisk signifikant reduktion p\u00e5 51% med Tresiba\u00ae i den fulde behandlingsperiode. Tresiba\u00ae forekom i studiet at have en sikker og veltolereret profil. Bivirkninger var sammenlignelige i de to behandlingsarme. De mest almindelige bivirkninger var fork\u00f8lelse og infektioner i de \u00f8vre luftveje. \"Vi er rigtig glade for disse resultater, som i et blindet fors\u00f8g bekr\u00e6fter, at risikoen for hypoglyk\u00e6mi neds\u00e6ttes signifikant ved brug af Tresiba\u00ae sammenlignet med insulin glargin,\" siger Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, koncerndirekt\u00f8r for forskning og udvikling i Novo Nordisk. \"Vi ser frem til at rapportere om udfaldet af SWITCH 1-studiet, hvor det g\u00e6lder type 1-diabetes, og at evaluere resultaterne fra begge studier.\" Novo Nordisk forventer at offentligg\u00f8re de overordnede resultater fra SWITCH 1 senere i f\u00f8rste kvartal af 2016.

Nonacog beta pegol is a glycopegylated recombinant factor IX with a significantly improved pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, developed for patients with haemophilia B. Novo Nordisk expects to file the Biologics License Application (BLA) for nonacog beta pegol to the US Food and Drug Administration during first half of 2016. The filing of nonacog beta pegol is based on the results from the paradigm clinical trial programme, which involved 115 patients with severe or moderately severe haemophilia B. Nonacog beta pegol was found to be efficacious in routine prophylaxis, treatment of bleeding episodes and surgery for adults, adolescents and children. Furthermore, nonacog beta pegol appeared to be well-tolerated and no safety concerns were identified. Compared to standard factor IX products, nonacog beta pegol has a five times longer half-life. Patients in the paradigm study achieved a higher level of factor IX in the blood despite less frequent dosing of nonacog beta pegol. In the phase 3 trials, once-weekly administration of 40 IU\/kg nonacog beta pegol maintained factor IX activity levels above 15%, reduced the median annualised bleeding rate (ABR) to 1.0 and showed a potential to prevent bleeds in target joints. Furthermore, these patients reported an improvement in quality of life during the trial. \"With the regulatory filing of our long-acting factor IX, patients with haemophilia B are one step closer to having a new treatment option\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"With its high factor activity level, less frequent dosing and very low ABRs, nonacog beta pegol has the potential to improve the quality of life for both patients and their families.\" Nonacog beta pegol is an extended half-life factor IX molecule intended for replacement therapy in patients with haemophilia B. Glycopegylation, the prolongation technology used for the half-life extension, is a novel approach in haemophilia B, already proven safe and efficacious in haemophilia A and other therapeutic areas. The paradigm clinical trial programme for nonacog beta pegol enrolled children and adults with severe or moderately severe haemophilia B. A total of 115 previously treated patients with a total of more than 8,800 exposure days for up to 2.7 years of treatment with nonacog beta pegol. The paradigm 1 PK trial (16 people treated) - a single-dose escalation trial evaluating safety and PK of nonacog beta pegol compared with marketed recombinant and plasma-derived factor IX products. Nonacog beta pegol showed up to twofold increase in recovery, higher activity levels and a fivefold prolongation of half-life compared to existing treatment. The paradigm 2 pivotal trial (74 people treated) - a 52-week single-blinded randomised trial evaluating safety, efficacy and PK for adults and adolescents in routine prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds. When provided prophylactic at 40 IU\/kg weekly, nonacog beta pegol appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile and showed a median annualised spontaneous bleeding rate of 0.0. Furthermore, 97% of breakthrough bleeds were treated successfully and 90% of target joints no longer classified as such. The paradigm 3 surgery trial (13 people treated) - a dedicated trial confirming safety and efficacy during and after major surgical procedures. In all patients, a single preoperative dose provided effective haemostatic coverage, and no patient required additional doses on the day of surgery. Additionally, three doses proved sufficient in maintaining haemostasis during the first two weeks following the procedure. The paradigm 4 extension trial (71 people treated) - a safety extension trial with longer-term exposure demonstrated a well-tolerated profile with no inhibitors or other safety signals identified. The paradigm 5 paediatric trial (25 people treated) - a 52-week single-arm trial evaluating once-weekly prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding episodes in previously treated children 1-12 years of age. Nonacog beta pegol appeared to have a safe profile, and all patients maintained mean factor activity levels above 15% one week after dosing of 40 IU\/kg and a median ABR of 0.0 and 2.0 for children aged 0-6 and 7-12 years old respectively.

Nonacog beta pegol er et glykopegyleret rekombinant faktor IX-pr\u00e6parat med en signifikant forbedret farmakokinetisk profil, udviklet til behandling af h\u00e6mofili B. Novo Nordisk forventer at indsende registreringsans\u00f8gning (Biologics License Application - BLA) for nonacog beta pegol til de amerikanske sundhedsmyndigheder, FDA, i f\u00f8rste halv\u00e5r af 2016. Registreringsans\u00f8gningen for nonacog beta pegol er baseret p\u00e5 resultaterne fra det kliniske udviklingsprogram 'paradigm', som omfattede 115 deltagere med sv\u00e6r eller moderat sv\u00e6r h\u00e6mofili B. Studierne viste, at nonacog beta pegol var virkningsfuldt til rutinem\u00e6ssig forebyggende behandling, behandling af bl\u00f8dningsepisoder samt ved kirurgiske indgreb hos voksne, unge og b\u00f8rn. Nonacog beta pegol forekom endvidere at v\u00e6re veltolereret, og der blev ikke identificeret sikkerhedsm\u00e6ssige problemer. Nonacog beta pegol har en fem gange l\u00e6ngere halveringstid sammenlignet med g\u00e6ngse faktor IX-produkter. Deltagere i paradigm-studiet opn\u00e5ede et h\u00f8jere faktor IX-niveau i blodet trods mindre hyppig dosering af nonacog beta pegol. \u00c9n ugentlig dosering p\u00e5 40 IU\/kg nonacog beta pegol opretholdt i fase 3-studierne et faktor IX-aktivitetsniveau p\u00e5 over 15%, reducerede medianv\u00e6rdien for den \u00e5rlige bl\u00f8dningsfrekvens til 1,0 og viste potentiale til at forebygge bl\u00f8dninger i s\u00e5kaldte target joints (led, der er s\u00e6rligt udsat for gentagne bl\u00f8dninger). Disse deltagere rapporterede desuden om forbedret livskvalitet i studiet. \"Med indsendelsen af registreringsans\u00f8gningen for vores langtidsvirkende faktor IX er mennesker med h\u00e6mofili B kommet et skridt t\u00e6ttere p\u00e5 en ny behandlingsmulighed,\" siger Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, koncerndirekt\u00f8r i Novo Nordisk med ansvar for forskning og udvikling. \"Nonacog beta pegol har med sit h\u00f8je faktoraktivitetsniveau, den mindre hyppige dosering og meget lave \u00e5rlige bl\u00f8dningsfrekvens potentiale til at forbedre livskvaliteten b\u00e5de for patienterne og deres familie.\" Nonacog beta pegol er et faktor IX-molekyle med forl\u00e6nget halveringstid, der er beregnet til substitutionsbehandling hos mennesker med h\u00e6mofili B. Halveringstiden er forl\u00e6nget ved hj\u00e6lp af glykopegylerings-teknikken - en ny tilgang indenfor h\u00e6mofili B, som allerede har vist sig sikker og virkningsfuld indenfor h\u00e6mofili A og andre behandlingsomr\u00e5der. Det kliniske udviklingsprogram paradigm for nonacog beta pegol er gennemf\u00f8rt blandt b\u00f8rn og voksne med sv\u00e6r eller moderat sv\u00e6r h\u00e6mofili B - i alt 115 tidligere behandlede patienter med sammenlagt mere end 8.800 dages eksponering for op til 2,7 \u00e5rs behandling med nonacog beta pegol. Paradigm 1, farmakokinetisk studie (16 deltagere behandlet) - et enkeltdosis-eskaleringsstudie, der unders\u00f8gte sikkerhed og farmakokinetik for nonacog beta pegol sammenlignet med markedsf\u00f8rte rekombinante og plasmabaserede faktor IX-produkter. Nonacog beta pegol viste op til to gange forh\u00f8jet genfindelse i blodbanen, h\u00f8jere aktivitetsniveau og en fem gange l\u00e6ngere halveringstid sammenlignet med eksisterende behandling. Paradigm 2, pivotalstudie (74 deltagere behandlet) - et 52-ugers enkeltblindet, randomiseret studie, der unders\u00f8gte sikkerhed, effekt og farmakokinetik hos voksne og unge ved rutinem\u00e6ssig forebyggelse og behandling af bl\u00f8dninger. Ved forebyggende behandling med 40 IU\/kg doseret \u00e9n gang ugentligt forekom nonacog beta pegol at have en sikker og veltolereret profil og viste en medianv\u00e6rdi for den \u00e5rlige bl\u00f8dningsfrekvens for spontane bl\u00f8dninger p\u00e5 0,0. Endvidere blev 97% af s\u00e5kaldte breakthrough bleeds (spontane bl\u00f8dninger under behandlingsforl\u00f8bet) stoppet, og 90% af s\u00e5kaldte target joints (led, der er s\u00e6rligt udsat for gentagne bl\u00f8dninger) blev ikke l\u00e6ngere klassificeret som s\u00e5dan. Paradigm 3, kirurgistudie (13 deltagere behandlet) - et dedikeret studie, der bekr\u00e6ftede sikkerhed og effekt under og efter st\u00f8rre kirurgiske indgreb. Hos alle deltagere var en enkelt dosis forud for operationen tilstr\u00e6kkeligt til at forebygge bl\u00f8dning, og der var ikke behov for at give yderligere doser p\u00e5 operationsdagen. Endvidere viste det sig, at tre doser var tilstr\u00e6kkelige til at opretholde h\u00e6mostase i de f\u00f8rste to uger efter operationen. Paradigm 4, forl\u00e6ngelsesstudie (71 deltagere behandlet) - et sikkerhedsstudie med l\u00e6ngere tids eksponering, der viste en veltolereret profil uden identifikation af inhibitorer (neutraliserende antistoffer) eller andre sikkerhedsm\u00e6ssige signaler. Paradigm 5, p\u00e6diatrisk studie (25 deltagere behandlet) - et 52-ugers enkeltgruppestudie, der unders\u00f8gte forebyggende behandling doseret \u00e9n gang ugentligt og behandling af bl\u00f8dningsepisoder hos tidligere behandlede b\u00f8rn i alderen 1-12 \u00e5r. Nonacog beta pegol forekom at have en sikker profil, og alle deltagere opretholdt et gennemsnitligt faktoraktivitetsniveau p\u00e5 over 15% \u00e9n uge efter dosering af 40 IU\/kg og en medianv\u00e6rdi for den \u00e5rlige bl\u00f8dningsfrekvens p\u00e5 henholdsvis 0,0 og 2,0 for b\u00f8rn i alderen 0-6 og 7-12 \u00e5r.

Ved at kombinere de to organisationers ekspertise og specialistviden ventes samarbejdet at skabe ny viden om en r\u00e6kke sidegevinster ved klimaindsatsen i byerne, herunder sundhed. \u00c5rsagen til partnerskabet er den stigende betydning, verdens storbyer spiller i kampen mod b\u00e5de klimaforandringer og usund livsstil. De hastigt voksende byer tegner sig for to tredjedele af det globale energiforbrug og mere end 70% af CO2-udledningen,[i] og to tredjedele af verdens 415 mio. diabetikere bor i byomr\u00e5der.[ii] Mange byer er allerede i dag godt i gang med at tr\u00e6ffe foranstaltninger, som reducerer CO2-udledningen og p\u00e5 andre m\u00e5der kommer indbyggerne til gavn - lige fra delecykelordninger til klimatilpasningsplaner, der skal mindske f\u00f8lgerne af oversv\u00f8mmelser og hedeb\u00f8lger.

The collaboration will see the organisations' expertise and specialist knowledge combine to generate new insights on a range of co-benefits of climate action - in particular the health of city populations. At the heart of the partnership lies the pivotal role of cities in the fight against climate change and poor health. City lifestyles are contributing to the diabetes epidemic and two thirds of the world's 415 million people living with the condition can be found in urban areas.1 Meanwhile, the rapid rise of cities accounts for two thirds of global energy consumption and more than 70% of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.2 From bike share schemes to adaptation efforts that lessen the impact of floods and heatwaves, civic leaders are already taking decisions that will reduce emissions and deliver additional benefits to their citizens. The research will help city leaders to build a case for other specific climate actions that will have the greatest impact on both emission reductions and improved health and prosperity. \"Mexico City has seen first-hand how policies designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can have far-reaching positive effects on the health and wellbeing of our citizens,\" said Mexico City Mayor Miguel \u00c1ngel Mancera. \"This research will create the evidence base to confirm what every mayor within the C40 network knows; that environmental policies have benefits far beyond the narrow focus of reducing emissions.\" As a leader in the field of diabetes, Novo Nordisk brings to the partnership a deep understanding of how the condition affects individuals, families, health systems and societies. The partnership's research will benefit from insights secured via the Cities Changing Diabetes study - the world's largest study of urban diabetes led by University College London (UCL) and supported by Novo Nordisk. \"Improving the health of city dwellers has been a priority for Novo Nordisk since we initiated the Cities Changing Diabetes programme in 2014,\" said Novo Nordisk executive vice president Jakob Riis. \"By working with a world-renowned group in C40, we aim to help city leaders to develop and maintain urban environments that facilitate good health and prevent conditions such as diabetes.\" Commenting on the aims of the partnership, Mark Watts, executive director, C40 said \"Each week 1.4 million people move into cities. Tackling climate change and reducing cities greenhouse gas emissions is not just important because of global warming but also for the health and well-being of urban citizens around the world. Green policies provide cleaner air, new jobs, increased city revenue and many other benefits. By more clearly identifying these co-benefits, C40 believes this research will allow mayors and urban policy makers to make an even stronger case for taking climate action in cities around the world.\" Novo Nordisk is a global healthcare company with more than 90 years of innovation and leadership in diabetes care.

Semaglutid forekom i studiet at have en sikker og veltolereret profil. Den mest almindelige bivirkning var kvalme, som aftog over tid. Kvalme blev rapporteret hos 18% af deltagere i behandling med 0,5 mg semaglutid, og hos 18% af deltagere i behandling med 1,0 mg semaglutid, sammenlignet med 7% af deltagere i behandling med 100 mg sitagliptin. Frafaldsprocenten som f\u00f8lge af bivirkninger var 8% og 10% for deltagere i behandling med henholdsvis 0,5 mg semaglutid og 1,0 mg semaglutid, mod 3% for deltagere i behandling med 100 mg sitagliptin. \"Vi er rigtig glade for resultaterne fra SUSTAIN 2, som viste, at semaglutid givet som \u00e9n ugentlig injektion gav bedre effekt med hensyn til blodsukkerregulering og v\u00e6gttab sammenlignet med 100 mg sitagliptin. Det er konsistent med det resultat, vi har set p\u00e5 tv\u00e6rs af alle de SUSTAIN-studier, der er rapporteret resultater fra indtil nu,\" siger Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, koncerndirekt\u00f8r for forskning og udvikling i Novo Nordisk. \"De resultater, vi har set indtil nu i SUSTAIN-programmet, underst\u00f8tter, at semaglutid har potentiale til at blive det mest virkningsfulde GLP-1-produkt for mennesker med type 2-diabetes.\" Novo Nordisk forventer at offentligg\u00f8re de overordnede resultater fra de resterende to SUSTAIN-studier i f\u00f8rste halv\u00e5r af 2016. Om semaglutid Semaglutid er en ny GLP-1-analog (glukagonlignende peptid-1), som kan hj\u00e6lpe mennesker med type 2-diabetes med at opn\u00e5 en markant forbedring af blodsukkeret med lav risiko for hypoglyk\u00e6mi. Semaglutid medf\u00f8rer endvidere v\u00e6gttab ved at neds\u00e6tte appetit og madindtag. Semaglutid til subkutan dosering (ved injektion i underhuden) \u00e9n gang ugentligt er i fase 3-udvikling til behandling af type 2-diabetes. Semaglutid er endvidere under udvikling i tabletform til oral behandling af type 2-diabetes samt i injicerbare udgaver til subkutan dosering \u00e9n gang dagligt til behandling af type 2-diabetes og v\u00e6gtregulering. Om det kliniske udviklingsprogram SUSTAIN SUSTAIN er et klinisk fase 3-program, som omfatter seks globale studier med semaglutid doseret subkutant \u00e9n gang om ugen med deltagelse af flere end 7.000 mennesker med type 2-diabetes. SUSTAIN 1 - et 30-ugers effekt- og sikkerhedsstudie, der unders\u00f8ger semaglutid i forhold til placebo hos 388 deltagere med type 2-diabetes, som ikke tidligere har f\u00e5et medicinsk behandling.

Semaglutide is a new GLP-1 analogue administered subcutaneously once weekly. The double-blinded trial investigated the efficacy and safety of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg semaglutide compared with 100 mg sitagliptin, a once-daily DPP-IV inhibitor, after 56 weeks of treatment in 1,231 people with type 2 diabetes, where both drugs were added on to metformin, thiazolidinedione (TZD) or a combination of metformin\/TZD. The trial successfully achieved its objective by demonstrating that from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.1%, people treated with 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg semaglutide achieved a statistically significant and superior improvement in HbA1c of 1.3% and 1.6% respectively, compared to an improvement in HbA1c of 0.5% with 100 mg sitagliptin. 69% of the people treated with 0.5 mg semaglutide and 78% of the people treated with 1.0 mg semaglutide achieved the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) treatment target of HbA1c below 7% compared with 36% of the people treated with 100 mg sitagliptin. Furthermore, from a mean baseline body weight of 89 kg, people treated with 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg semaglutide experienced a statistically significant and superior weight loss of 4.3 kg and 6.1 kg respectively, compared with a weight loss of 1.9 kg for people treated with 100 mg sitagliptin. In the trial, semaglutide appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. The most common adverse event was nausea which diminished over time. Nausea was reported by 18% of the people treated with 0.5 mg semaglutide and by 18% of the people treated with 1.0 mg semaglutide, compared with 7% of people treated with 100 mg sitagliptin. The discontinuation rate due to adverse events was 8% and 10% for people treated with 0.5 mg semaglutide and 1.0 mg semaglutide respectively, compared to 3% for people treated with 100 mg sitagliptin. \"We are excited about the results of SUSTAIN 2, showing superior efficacy in glycaemic control and weight loss with semaglutide administered once-weekly compared with 100 mg sitagliptin, which is consistent with the outcome seen across all SUSTAIN trials reported to date,\" says Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"The results from the SUSTAIN programme thus far support that semaglutide has the potential to become the most efficacious GLP-1 product for people with type 2 diabetes.\" Novo Nordisk expects to announce headline results of the two remaining SUSTAIN trials in the first half of 2016. Semaglutide is a new glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue that can help people with type 2 diabetes achieve substantial improvement of blood glucose with a low risk of hypoglycaemia. In addition, semaglutide induces weight loss by decreasing appetite and food intake. Semaglutide administered subcutaneously once weekly is in phase 3 development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, semaglutide is being developed in an oral tablet version for treatment of type 2 diabetes as well as once-daily subcutaneous versions for treatment of type 2 diabetes and weight management. About the SUSTAIN clinical programme The SUSTAIN programme is a phase 3 clinical programme comprising six global trials of semaglutide administered subcutaneously once weekly encompassing more than 7,000 people with type 2 diabetes. SUSTAIN 1 - a 30-week efficacy and safety trial of semaglutide versus placebo in 388 drug-na\u00efve people with type 2 diabetes. SUSTAIN 2 - a 56-week efficacy and safety trial of semaglutide versus sitagliptin once-daily as add-on to metformin and\/or TZD in 1,231 people with type 2 diabetes. SUSTAIN 3 - a 56-week efficacy and safety trial of semaglutide versus 2.0 mg exenatide once-weekly as add-on to 1-2 oral antidiabetic drugs in 813 people with type 2 diabetes.

Faster-acting insulin aspart is a mealtime insulin for improved control of postprandial glucose excursions and has been developed for the treatment of people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The filing of faster-acting insulin aspart is based on the results from the 'onset' clinical trial programme which involved around 2,100 people with type 1 and 2 diabetes. In the onset programme, people treated with faster-acting insulin aspart achieved improvements in postprandial control versus NovoLog\u00ae (marketed as NovoRapid\u00ae outside the US) and an HbA1c reduction on par with NovoLog\u00ae. For people with type 1 diabetes, faster-acting insulin aspart results from the double-blinded onset 1 trial showed statistically significantly greater HbA1c reduction when dosed at mealtime or similar HbA1c reduction when dosed 20 minutes after a meal compared to NovoLog\u00ae. Across the onset trials, faster-acting insulin aspart had a safe and well tolerated profile, with the most common adverse event being hypoglycaemia, similar to the levels observed with NovoLog\u00ae. \"We are happy to be able to file faster-acting insulin aspart for regulatory approval in the US and have the opportunity to address unmet medical needs for people requiring improved blood glucose control around meals,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"Onset 1 shows that faster-acting insulin aspart has the potential to offer improved postprandial glucose and either an additional reduction of HbA1c or added flexibility compared with NovoLog\u00ae.\" Novo Nordisk intends to make faster-acting insulin aspart available in the prefilled delivery device FlexTouch\u00ae. About faster-acting insulin aspart Faster-acting insulin aspart is a mealtime insulin for the control of postprandial glucose excursions in type 1 and type 2 diabetes as well as in pump treatment. Faster-acting insulin aspart is insulin aspart (NovoLog\u00ae) in a new formulation in which two new excipients have been added to ensure early and fast absorption. About the onset clinical programme The onset programme is a phase 3 clinical programme with faster-acting insulin aspart consisting of four trials encompassing more than 2,100 people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The onset 1 trial (1,143 people randomised) - a 26+26-week randomised, double-blinded, basal-bolus, treat-to-target trial investigating faster-acting insulin aspart compared to NovoLog\u00ae, both in combination with Levemir\u00ae in adults with type 1 diabetes. The results were reported in March and October 2015. The onset 2 trial (689 people randomised) - a 26-week randomised, double-blinded, basal-bolus, treat-to-target trial investigating faster-acting insulin aspart compared to NovoLog\u00ae, both in combination with insulin glargine in adults with type 2 diabetes. The results were reported in March 2015. The onset 3 trial (236 people randomised) - an 18-week randomised, open-label, basal bolus vs basal trial confirming superiority (in terms of HbA1c) of mealtime faster-acting insulin aspart in a full basal-bolus regimen versus basal insulin therapy, both in combination with metformin. The results were reported in January 2015. The onset 4 trial (37 people randomised) - a six-week randomised, double-blinded, parallel-group trial confirming pump compatibility and safety of faster-acting insulin aspart and NovoLog\u00ae in type 1 diabetes.

Andre produktionsanl\u00e6g i USA, Frankrig, Rusland, Algeriet og Iran vil indg\u00e5 lignende aftaler i de kommende \u00e5r. \"I Danmark f\u00e5r vi vores elektricitet fra vindm\u00f8ller, og det bliver ogs\u00e5 tilf\u00e6ldet i Kina, men der findes ikke en standardl\u00f8sning. Vi vil derfor finde frem til de mest effektive vedvarende energikilder til den elektricitet, vi skal bruge p\u00e5 vores produktionsanl\u00e6g i de andre lande,\" forklarer Henrik Wulff. \"Det giver god mening at skifte til elektricitet fra vedvarende energikilder, b\u00e5de i forhold til klima og omkostninger. I takt med at flere og flere virksomheder investerer i elektricitet fra vedvarende energikilder, bliver teknologien b\u00e5de mere effektiv og billigere.\" Novo Nordisk har for nylig, sammen med nogle af verdens mest indflydelsesrige virksomheder, tilsluttet sig RE100, som er et f\u00e6lles initiativ for globale virksomheder, der har forpligtet sig til at anvende elektricitet udelukkende fra vedvarende energikilder.

Once implemented, there will be no CO2 emissions from the electricity used at the company's plants. Already today, the company's production sites in Denmark, Brazil and Japan use electricity from renewable sources. \"Setting an absolute target of zero CO2 emissions from electricity at all our global production sites in just five years is ambitious, as our production is growing to meet the increasing global demand for our diabetes products,\" says Henrik Wulff, executive vice president and head of Novo Nordisk Product Supply.  An important step in achieving the 2020 ambition was taken last month when Novo Nordisk's production site Tianjin in China signed an agreement on purchasing electricity from a windmill farm in Inner Mongolia. Other production sites in the US, France, Russia, Algeria and Iran will enter similar agreements in the coming years. \"In Denmark, we get our electricity from windmills and this will also be the case in China, but there is not a one-size-fits-all solution and we will identify the most efficient renewable electricity sources for our production facilities in the other countries,\" explains Henrik Wulff. \"Switching to renewable electricity makes sense from both a climate and a cost perspective. As more companies invest in renewable electricity, the technology is likely to get even more efficient and less costly.\" Novo Nordisk has recently, together with some of world's most influential companies, joined the RE100, which is a collaborative initiative of global businesses committed to using 100% renewable electricity.

Results from the SUSTAIN 4 trial comparing once-weekly subcutaneous administration of the GLP-1 analogue semaglutide with once-daily insulin glargine SUSTAIN 4, the third phase 3a trial for semaglutide to report results, included a total of 1,089 people with type 2 diabetes previously treated with metformin with or without sulfonylurea. From a mean baseline, HbA1c of 8.2%, people treated once-weekly with doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg semaglutide achieved statistically significant and superior improvements in HbA1c of 1.2% and 1.6%, respectively, compared to 0.8% with insulin glargine after 30 weeks of treatment. The mean daily insulin glargine dose was 29 units. Furthermore, from a mean baseline body weight of 93 kg, people treated with 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg semaglutide experienced statistically significant and superior weight loss of 3.5 kg and 5.2 kg, respectively, compared with a weight gain of 1.2 kg with insulin glargine. In the trial, semaglutide appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. The most common adverse event was nausea which diminished over time. Nausea was reported by up to 22% of people treated with semaglutide compared with 4% of people treated with insulin glargine. Severe or blood glucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia was experienced by 4% and 6% of people treated with 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg once-weekly semaglutide, respectively, compared with 11% in the insulin glargine group. Results from the phase 2 programme with oral semaglutide and the design of the phase 3a programme PIONEER Further details from the phase 2 programme with the once-daily oral GLP-1 analogue, oral semaglutide, will be presented.

Tresiba\u00ae, the approved brand name for insulin degludec, is a once-daily new-generation basal insulin analogue with a half-life of 25 hours and a duration of action of at least 42 hours. In 'treat-to-target' studies comparing Tresiba\u00ae to insulin glargine, people using Tresiba\u00ae achieved similar reduction in long-term blood glucose (HbA1c), numerically greater fasting plasma glucose reduction, while using numerically lower doses of insulin in a majority of the studies. Furthermore, the studies demonstrated that Tresiba\u00ae is the first basal insulin to offer people with diabetes the possibility of injecting their basal insulin at any time of the day with the option to adjust the time of injection. Ryzodeg\u00ae 70\/30, the approved brand name for insulin degludec\/insulin aspart, contains insulin degludec in a soluble co-formulation with insulin aspart. Ryzodeg\u00ae 70\/30 can be administered once or twice daily with any main meal. In a 'treat-to-target' study supporting the new drug application where Ryzodeg\u00ae 70\/30 was compared to NovoLog\u00ae Mix 70\/30, Ryzodeg\u00ae 70\/30 showed equivalent reductions in HbA1c. Novo Nordisk expects to launch Tresiba\u00ae in the US during the first quarter of 2016. Tresiba\u00ae will be available in the FlexTouch\u00ae device and be offered in two concentrations enabling maximum doses of 80 units and 160 units per injection, respectively. On 26 March 2015, Novo Nordisk announced the decision to submit the class II resubmissions of the NDAs following the completion of the interim analysis of the cardiovascular outcomes trial for insulin degludec, DEVOTE. In order to preserve the integrity of the ongoing DEVOTE trial, only a small dedicated team within Novo Nordisk has access to the data. Novo Nordisk management does not have access to the results of the interim analysis. The trial is still expected to have accrued the prespecified number of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) for the full trial analysis in mid-2016. \"We are very happy with FDA's decision to approve Tresiba\u00ae and Ryzodeg\u00ae 70\/30 as we believe these products offer significant benefits and important treatment options for people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes\", said Lars Rebien S\u00f8rensen, president and chief executive officer of Novo Nordisk. \"The approvals mark an important milestone for Novo Nordisk and we look forward to making Tresiba\u00ae available for people in the US\". Reflecting a separate action, Novo Nordisk today also announced that a New Drug Application for Xultophy\u00ae, the first once-daily single-injection combination of Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) and Victoza\u00ae (liraglutide), has been submitted to the FDA.

The aim of the research collaboration, which is conducted at both MIT in Boston, US and at Novo Nordisk's research facilities in M\u00e5l\u00f8v and Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark, is to develop the next generation of drug delivery devices as an alternative to parenteral or injection-based delivery of peptides. Professor Robert Langer's laboratory are world-leading experts in creating new approaches for delivering drugs such as peptides and proteins across complex barriers in the body such as the blood-brain barrier, the intestine, the lung and the skin. Together with Dr Giovanni Traverso, a gastroenterologist and biomedical engineer at Harvard Medical School, and research affiliate of MIT, they will lead a team in the development of a platform enabling the oral delivery of peptides. There are many challenges of developing and producing a reliable peptide delivery vehicle. They include avoiding premature degradation in the body, overcoming poor peptide transport over epithelial barriers, limiting variability of absorption (caused, for example, by interaction with food in the stomach), and producing both peptide and the delivery vehicle in sufficient scale and numbers cost-effectively. If these challenges can be overcome, as recent research suggests, drug delivery devices hold great therapeutic promise for a plethora of diseases where patients need to take frequent injections. \"Drug delivery devices hold great potential and I am looking forward to this exciting research collaboration with one of the world's leading drug delivery laboratories,\" says Peter Kurtzhals, senior vice president and head of global research at Novo Nordisk. Robert Langer, professor and head of the Langer Laboratory at MIT, says, \"We are very excited to be doing research sponsored by Novo Nordisk to address one of the current greatest challenges in drug delivery\". The collaboration will establish a number of research positions to be hosted by the Langer Laboratory and funded by Novo Nordisk. The initial term of the collaboration is three years with the option to extend for up to three additional years.

M\u00e5let med forskningssamarbejdet, som foreg\u00e5r p\u00e5 b\u00e5de MIT i Boston, USA, og p\u00e5 Novo Nordisks forskningscentre i M\u00e5l\u00f8v og Hiller\u00f8d, er at udvikle n\u00e6ste generation af doseringssystemer til l\u00e6gemidler som alternativ til parenteral- eller injektionsbaseret dosering af peptider. I professor Robert Langers laboratorium arbejder verdens f\u00f8rende eksperter med at udvikle nye metoder til dosering af l\u00e6gemidler som f.eks. peptider og proteiner over komplekse barrierer i kroppen, f.eks. blod-hjerne-barrieren, tarmsystemet, lungerne og huden.

Der er mange udfordringer forbundet med at udvikle og fremstille et p\u00e5lideligt peptid-doseringssystem. Disse omfatter at forhindre for tidlig nedbrydning i kroppen, at afhj\u00e6lpe d\u00e5rlig peptidtransport over epitelbarrierer, at begr\u00e6nse absorptionsvariabilitet (f.eks. for\u00e5rsaget af interaktion med f\u00f8de i maven) samt at fremstille b\u00e5de peptid og doseringssystem i tilstr\u00e6kkelige m\u00e6ngder p\u00e5 en omkostningseffektiv m\u00e5de. Hvis disse udfordringer kan l\u00f8ses, hvilket ny forskning tyder p\u00e5, er der gode fremtidige behandlingsmuligheder med denne type af doseringssystemer ved en lang r\u00e6kke sygdomme, hvor patienterne i dag har brug for hyppige injektioner. \"Der er et stort potentiale for disse nye doseringssystemer til l\u00e6gemidler, og jeg gl\u00e6der mig til dette sp\u00e6ndende samarbejde med et af verdens f\u00f8rende laboratorier indenfor dette felt,\" siger Peter Kurtzhals, koncerndirekt\u00f8r med ansvar for Global Research hos Novo Nordisk. \"Vi er meget glade for at udf\u00f8re forskning sponsoreret af Novo Nordisk med det form\u00e5l at l\u00f8se en af de st\u00f8rste udfordringer i l\u00e6gemiddeladministration i dag\", udtaler Robert Langer, professor og chef for Langer Laboratory ved MIT.

ADJUNCT ONE(TM) er et randomiseret, dobbeltblindet, placebokontrolleret studie, der unders\u00f8ger effekt og sikkerhed for daglige doser p\u00e5 0,6 mg, 1,2 mg og 1,8 mg liraglutid sammenlignet med placebo som till\u00e6gsbehandling til insulin. 1.398 deltagere med type 1-diabetes blev behandlet i 52 uger. Fra et gennemsnitligt langtidsblodsukkerniveau (HbA1c) p\u00e5 omkring 8,2% ved studiets begyndelse opn\u00e5ede deltagere, der blev behandlet med 1,2 mg og 1,8 mg liraglutid som till\u00e6gsbehandling til insulin, det prim\u00e6re m\u00e5l om ikke-inferi\u00f8ritet for HbA1c og viste en st\u00f8rre forbedring i HbA1c p\u00e5 omkring 0,5% sammenlignet med 0,3% for deltagere, der fik placebo. Det prim\u00e6re m\u00e5l om ikke-inferi\u00f8ritet for HbA1c blev ikke bekr\u00e6ftet for doseringen p\u00e5 0,6 mg.

I studiet var de mest almindelige bivirkninger relateret til mave-tarm-systemet, prim\u00e6rt forbig\u00e5ende kvalme og opkastning. Forekomsten af sv\u00e6r hypoglyk\u00e6mi (lavt blodsukker) var numerisk lavere, omend forskellen ikke var statistisk signifikant, for alle doseringer af liraglutid som till\u00e6gsbehandling til insulin sammenlignet med placebo. Der blev observeret en statistisk signifikant h\u00f8jere forekomst af bekr\u00e6ftet symptomatisk hypoglyk\u00e6mi blandt deltagere, der blev behandlet med 1,2 mg og 1,8 mg liraglutid, sammenlignet med deltagere, der fik placebo. Andelen af deltagere med alvorlige bivirkninger var sammenlignelig i alle behandlingsgrupper. Baseret p\u00e5 en risk\/benefit-vurdering af det samlede datas\u00e6t fra de to ADJUNCT-studier har Novo Nordisk for n\u00e6rv\u00e6rende ikke til hensigt at indsende ans\u00f8gning om en indikationsudvidelse for Victoza\u00ae til brug i type 1-diabetes.

ADJUNCT ONE(TM) is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating efficacy and safety of daily doses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg liraglutide compared with placebo as adjunct to insulin treatment. 1,398 people with type 1 diabetes were treated for 52 weeks. From a mean baseline HbA1c of around 8.2%, people treated with 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg liraglutide as adjunct to insulin therapy achieved the primary objective of non-inferiority in HbA1c and showed a greater improvement in HbA1c of around 0.5% compared with 0.3% for people treated with placebo. The primary objective of HbA1c non-inferiority was not confirmed for the 0.6 mg dose. Furthermore, from a mean baseline weight of around 86 kg, people treated with 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg liraglutide as adjunct to insulin therapy achieved a statistically significantly greater weight loss between 3 kg and 4 kg whereas people treated with placebo experienced a weight gain of around 1 kg. In the trial, the most common adverse events were related to the gastrointestinal system, primarily transient nausea and vomiting. The rate of severe hypoglycaemia appeared numerically, but not statistically significantly lower for all doses of liraglutide as adjunct to insulin therapy compared with placebo. A statistically significant higher rate of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia was observed among people treated with liraglutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg compared with people treated with placebo. The proportion of people with serious adverse events was similar in all treatment groups. Based on a risk\/benefit assessment of the overall dataset from the two ADJUNCT trials, Novo Nordisk does currently not intend to submit an application to expand the label of Victoza\u00ae for use in type 1 diabetes. Novo Nordisk intends to conduct thorough analyses to evaluate the clinical data and define potential future clinical and regulatory initiatives. \"The results of the two ADJUNCT trials show that liraglutide as adjunct to insulin therapy met the primary end-point of improving blood glucose control for people with type 1 diabetes, however, unfortunately without the hypoglycaemic benefit experienced in type 2 diabetes \" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. \"We are disappointed as we believed in the potential to provide people with type 1 diabetes with a new treatment option, and we will continue to invest in new treatment options for this group of people.\" Liraglutide is a once-daily human analogue of the naturally occurring hormone Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1). The compound is approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and is currently in phase 3 development for the treatment of type 1 diabetes as adjunct to insulin therapy. Liraglutide works by stimulating the release of insulin only when glucose levels become too high, supressing the glucagon production by the liver and by inhibiting appetite. In contrast to most other antidiabetic treatments, liraglutide also leads to weight loss instead of weight increase. The ADJUNCT programme is a phase 3 clinical programme comprising two global trials of liraglutide as adjunct to insulin therapy encompassing more than 2,000 people with type 1 diabetes. ADJUNCT ONE(TM) (1,398 people randomised) - a 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled treat-to-target trial investigating liraglutide as adjunct to insulin therapy.

Saxenda\u00ae is the first glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist for weight management, approved in the US, EU and Canada. In the US, it is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adults with obesity (BMI >=30 kg\/m2) or who are overweight (BMI >=27 kg\/m2) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition.1 Saxenda\u00ae was evaluated in the SCALE(TM) (Satiety and Clinical Adiposity-Liraglutide Evidence in Nondiabetic and Diabetic people) phase 3 clinical trial programme, which involved more than 5,000 study participants who have obesity (BMI >=30 kg\/m2) or who are overweight (BMI >=27 kg\/m2) with weight-related comorbidities. Trial data showed that Saxenda\u00ae, in combination with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, resulted in greater weight loss than reduced calorie diet and physical activity alone.1 \"We are pleased to make this new treatment option available, which we believe has the potential to help people with obesity lose weight and reduce weight-related comorbidities\" said Executive Vice President Jakob Riis, Marketing, Medical Affairs & Stakeholder Engagement of Novo Nordisk. \"The launch of Saxenda is an important milestone in Novo Nordisk's long-term commitment to obesity treatment and we look forward to launching Saxenda in other countries later in 2015.\" Recognised as a disease by the American Medical Association and other medical societies,obesity has grown in prevalence in the United States and around the world.2-4 Affecting approximately 35% of the US adult population in 2011-2012, obesity is associated with serious co-morbidities, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease and certain types of cancer.5,6\u00a0 Novo Nordisk expects to launch Saxenda\u00ae in several other markets starting in 2015. About obesityObesity is a disease that requires chronic management.3,7 It is associated with serious comorbidities including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), certain types of cancer and a decreased life expectancy.6,8,9 The risk of morbidity and mortality increases with the severity of obesity.10 It is a complex and multifactorial disease that is influenced by genetic, physiological, environmental and psychological factors.11 The global increase in the prevalence of obesity is a public health issue that has severe cost implications to healthcare systems.4,12 In 2011-2012 in the US, approximately 35% of adults, or nearly 80 million adults, lived with obesity.5 About Saxenda\u00aeSaxenda\u00ae is a once-daily glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue with 97% similarity to naturally occurring human GLP-1,13 a hormone that is released in response to food intake.14 Like human GLP-1, Saxenda\u00ae regulates appetite and lowers body weight through decreased food intake.15,16 As with other GLP-1 receptor agonists, liraglutide stimulates insulin secretion and reduces glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. These effects can lead to a reduction of blood glucose. Saxenda\u00ae has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, the European Commission and Health Canada. Headquartered in Denmark, Novo Nordisk is a global healthcare company with more than 90 years of innovation and leadership in diabetes care. The company also has leading positions within haemophilia care, growth hormone therapy and hormone replacement therapy, and is now entering the obesity therapy area. Novo Nordisk employs approximately 41,500 employees in 75 countries, and markets its products in more than 180 countries.

Further information Company announcement No 27 \/ 2015","528":"Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark, 14 April 2015 - Today, Novo Nordisk announced a three-year extension of its Changing Diabetes\u00ae in Children programme. Since 2009, free insulin and access to diabetes care have been provided to more than 13,000 children in nine countries in Africa and South-East Asia. During the five years, 108 diabetes clinics have been established and 5,479 healthcare professionals have received diabetes care training. A child in sub-Saharan Africa diagnosed with type 1 diabetes often has a life expectancy of less than a year[1]. As a response to this situation and as a call to action by the International Diabetes Federation, Novo Nordisk established the Changing Diabetes\u00ae in Children programme. The idea originated from a visit to a district hospital in Kenya by Lars Rebien S\u00f8rensen, CEO of Novo Nordisk. At the hospital, he met a Masai boy diagnosed with type 1 diabetes who had been deserted by his parents at a highway and taken to the hospital by some passers-by. \"It became clear to me that this boy had dire perspectives for staying alive,\" says Lars Rebien S\u00f8rensen. \"This is obviously hugely disturbing to anyone that has any way of influencing the situation.\" In Guinea, almost 400 children have been enrolled in the programme: \"Before we had the programme for children with diabetes in Guinea, the situation was very difficult. Many children diagnosed with diabetes had no access to treatment or stopped it because their parents could not afford buying insulin,\" explains Professor Naby Bald\u00e9, project partner at Donka University Hospital in Conakry, Guinea. \"It's a great progress for the children and their families; they will no longer have to choose between providing food for the family or treatment of one child.\" The Changing Diabetes\u00ae in Children programme will run until 2017 in order to consolidate the work that has been done and to strengthen the sustainability of the programme in each country. About Changing Diabetes\u00ae in Children The programme is run as a private-public partnership between Novo Nordisk, Roche, the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) and the World Diabetes Foundation (WDF). In each country (Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, Bangladesh and India), the programme is implemented by a group of local partners with the national Ministry of Health playing a key role to ensure that the programme is anchored within the existing healthcare system. Being part of the programme means that each child receives insulin free of charge along with strips and a glucometer to measure his blood sugar levels. But since type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition which needs to be monitored closely, insulin does not do it alone. Therefore, patient education for children and families and training of healthcare personnel is an essential part.

Siden 2009 har flere end 13.000 b\u00f8rn i ni lande i Afrika og Syd\u00f8stasien via dette program f\u00e5et gratis insulin og adgang til diabetesbehandling. Der er etableret 108 diabetesklinikker, og 5.479 l\u00e6ger og andet sundhedspersonale har modtaget undervisning i diabetesbehandling. I afrikanske lande syd for Sahara har et barn, som f\u00e5r stillet diagnosen type 1-diabetes, ofte en forventet levetid p\u00e5 mindre end et \u00e5r[1]. Det var \u00f8nsket om at g\u00f8re noget for at afhj\u00e6lpe denne situation - og samtidig efterkomme en opfordring fra International Diabetes Federation - der bevirkede, at Novo Nordisk etablerede programmet Changing Diabetes\u00ae in Children. Ideen blev f\u00f8dt, da Novo Nordisks administrerende direkt\u00f8r, Lars Rebien S\u00f8rensen, bes\u00f8gte et distriktshospital i Kenya. Her m\u00f8dte han en masaidreng med type 1-diabetes, som var blevet efterladt af sine for\u00e6ldre ved en landevej og derefter bragt til hospitalet af nogle forbipasserende. \"Det stod klart for mig, at denne dreng ikke havde mange chancer for at overleve,\" fort\u00e6ller Lars Rebien S\u00f8rensen. \"Og det er selvsagt en rystende erkendelse for enhver, der har bare den mindste mulighed for at p\u00e5virke situationen.\" I Guinea er n\u00e6sten 400 b\u00f8rn tilmeldt programmet: \"Inden Guinea kom med i programmet, var situationen meget vanskelig. Mange b\u00f8rn, der var blevet diagnosticeret med diabetes, havde ikke adgang til behandling eller stoppede med behandlingen, fordi deres for\u00e6ldre ikke havde r\u00e5d til at k\u00f8be insulin,\" forklarer professor Naby Bald\u00e9, projektpartner p\u00e5 Donka University Hospital i Conakry, Guinea. \"Programmet er et stort fremskridt for b\u00f8rnene og deres familier; de er nu ikke l\u00e6ngere n\u00f8dt til at v\u00e6lge mellem at k\u00f8be mad til familien eller medicin til et af b\u00f8rnene.\" Changing Diabetes\u00ae in Children l\u00f8ber indtil 2017 for at styrke det arbejde, der er gjort indtil nu, og sikre programmets fortsatte eksistens i de enkelte lande. Om Changing Diabetes\u00ae in Children Programmet drives som et privat-offentligt partnerskab mellem Novo Nordisk, Roche, International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) og Verdensdiabetesfonden (WDF). I de enkelte lande (Cameroun, Den Demokratiske Republik Congo, Etiopien, Guinea, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Bangladesh og Indien) implementeres programmet af en gruppe lokale samarbejdspartnere, og landenes sundhedsministerier spiller en afg\u00f8rende rolle i at sikre, at programmet forankres i det eksisterende sundhedssystem. B\u00f8rnene i programmet f\u00e5r gratis insulin, teststrimler og en blodsukkerm\u00e5ler. Men da type 1-diabetes er en kronisk sygdom, som skal f\u00f8lges t\u00e6t, er insulin i sig selv ikke nok. Derfor er patientundervisning for b\u00f8rnene, deres familier og sundhedspersonalet en lige s\u00e5 vigtig del af programmet.

Once the European Commission approves the label expansion, physicians in the European Union will be able to prescribe Tresiba\u00ae to children with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. According to the International Diabetes Federation, an estimated 497,100 children are living globally with type 1 diabetes and rates of type 2 diabetes among children are also on the increase1. \"When treating children and adolescents with diabetes, getting patients to target while minimising side effects is always a priority,\" said Dr Nandu Thalange, paediatric endocrinologist at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, Norwich, United Kingdom and the lead study investigator of the BEGIN\u00ae YOUNG 1 trial. \"This latest CHMP recommendation for Tresiba\u00ae offers patients between the ages of 1 and 17 a new once-daily basal insulin which allows patients to get to target with a reduced risk of hyperglycaemia with ketosis versus insulin detemir.\"The positive CHMP opinion for expanded use of Tresiba\u00ae in children and adolescents is based on efficacy and tolerability data from the BEGIN\u00ae YOUNG 1 trial, which is the first study to look into the long-term safety of Tresiba\u00ae in children with type 1 diabetes. Results show that Tresiba\u00ae given once daily in combination with insulin aspart effectively improved long-term glycaemic control2. Tresiba\u00ae was approved in Europe in 2013 for once-daily use in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes as a monotherapy and in combination with oral anti-diabetic (OAD) medicinal products or with mealtime insulin. In May 2014, Tresiba\u00ae was approved for combination use with GLP-1 receptor agonists3. About the studyThe BEGIN\u00ae YOUNG 1 trial was a randomised controlled, 26-week open-label, treat-to-target trial (with a 26-week extension) investigating the efficacy and safety of Tresiba\u00ae, given once daily, and insulin detemir, given once or twice daily, both in combination with bolus insulin aspart in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes2. Tresiba\u00ae met the primary endpoint of non-inferiority to insulin detemir for mean change in HbA1c (p<0.05) at 26 weeks. In the 26-week extension a lower insulin dose and a significantly greater reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG[1]) versus insulin detemir (p<0.05) was achieved2. Both regimens had similar rates of overall and nocturnal hypoglycaemia, and the rate of severe hypoglycaemia was numerically higher with Tresiba\u00ae plus insulin aspart2. Of note, patients on Tresiba\u00ae had significantly lower rates of hyperglycaemia with ketosis (p<0.05)2. Weight (measured as SD score[2]) increased with Tresiba\u00ae and remained unchanged with insulin detemir2. Adverse event profiles were similar for Tresiba\u00ae and insulin detemir2. About Tresiba\u00ae Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) is a once-daily basal insulin that provides an ultra-long duration of action beyond 42 hours3,4. It is important for people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes to establish a routine for insulin treatment. On occasions when administration at the same time of day is not possible, Tresiba\u00ae allows for flexibility in day-to-day dosing time when needed3,5,6. Tresiba\u00ae has received regulatory approval in Argentina, Aruba, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, the EU, Honduras, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Israel, Japan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Lichtenstein, Macedonia, Mexico, Nepal, Norway, Russia, South Korea, Switzerland and the UAE. Further information References [1] FPG measures the concentration of glucose in the plasma after the patient has not eaten for at least eight hours. [2] Standard deviation (SD) measures the amount of variation from the average. A low standard deviation indicates that the data points are close to the average; a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a large range of values.","570":"K\u00f8benhavn, den 19. december 2014 - Udvalget for Humanmedicinske L\u00e6gemidler (CHMP) under Det Europ\u00e6iske L\u00e6gemiddelagentur (EMA) har i dag afgivet en positiv udtalelse om udvidet brug af Tresiba\u00ae til behandling af b\u00f8rn og unge i alderen 1-17 \u00e5r med diabetes. N\u00e5r Europa-Kommissionen har godkendt den udvidede anvendelse, vil l\u00e6gerne i EU kunne ordinere Tresiba\u00ae til b\u00f8rn med type 1- og type 2-diabetes. Den internationale diabetesforening, IDF, ansl\u00e5r, at 497.100 b\u00f8rn i verden har type 1-diabetes, og forekomsten af type 2-diabetes blandt b\u00f8rn er ogs\u00e5 stigende[1]. \"N\u00e5r man behandler b\u00f8rn og unge med diabetes, er der s\u00e6rlig fokus p\u00e5, at de opn\u00e5r det anbefalede blodsukkerm\u00e5l med f\u00e6rrest mulige bivirkninger,\" siger dr. Nandu Thalange, b\u00f8rnel\u00e6ge ved Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, Norwich, Storbritannien, og fors\u00f8gsansvarlig for BEGIN\u00ae YOUNG 1-studiet. \"CHMP's seneste anbefaling af Tresiba\u00ae \u00e5bner mulighed for at behandle b\u00f8rn og unge mellem 1 og 17 \u00e5r med en ny basalinsulin \u00e9n gang dagligt, som hj\u00e6lper dem med at n\u00e5 det \u00f8nskede blodsukkerm\u00e5l med mindre risiko for hyperglyk\u00e6mi med ketose sammenlignet med insulin detemir.\" CHMP's anbefaling af den udvidede brug af Tresiba\u00ae til behandling af b\u00f8rn og unge er baseret p\u00e5 effekt- og tolerabilitetsdata fra BEGIN\u00ae YOUNG 1, som er det f\u00f8rste studie, der har unders\u00f8gt den langsigtede sikkerhed for Tresiba\u00ae hos b\u00f8rn med type 1-diabetes. Resultaterne viser, at Tresiba\u00ae givet \u00e9n gang dagligt i kombination med insulin aspart forbedrede den langsigtede blodsukkerregulering[2]. Tresiba\u00ae blev godkendt i Europa i 2013 til brug \u00e9n gang dagligt hos voksne med type 1- og type 2-diabetes som monoterapi, i kombination med diabetesl\u00e6gemidler i tabletform samt i kombination med m\u00e5ltidsinsulin. I maj 2014 blev Tresiba\u00ae godkendt til kombinationsbehandling med GLP-1-receptoragonister[3]. BEGIN\u00ae YOUNG 1-studiet blev gennemf\u00f8rt som et randomiseret, kontrolleret, 26-ugers ikke-blindet treat to target-studie (med en 26-ugers forl\u00e6ngelse), der unders\u00f8gte effekt og sikkerhed for Tresiba\u00ae doseret \u00e9n gang dagligt og insulin detemir doseret \u00e9n eller to gange dagligt, begge i kombination med bolus insulin aspart hos b\u00f8rn og unge med type 1-diabetes2. Tresiba\u00ae opfyldte det prim\u00e6re m\u00e5lepunkt om ikke-inferi\u00f8ritet overfor insulin detemir for gennemsnitlig \u00e6ndring i HbA1c (p<0,05) ved 26 uger. I 26-ugers forl\u00e6ngelsen opn\u00e5edes en lavere insulindosis og en signifikant st\u00f8rre reduktion i fasteblodsukkeret[*] sammenlignet med insulin detemir (p<0,05)2. Begge behandlingsregimer havde sammenlignelige forekomster af generel og natlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi, og forekomsten af alvorlig hypoglyk\u00e6mi var numerisk h\u00f8jere med Tresiba\u00ae plus insulin aspart2. Desuden havde patienter, der blev behandlet med Tresiba\u00ae, en signifikant lavere forekomst af hyperglyk\u00e6mi (h\u00f8jt blodsukker) med ketose (p<0,05)2. V\u00e6gten (m\u00e5lt som SD-score**) steg med Tresiba\u00ae og forblev u\u00e6ndret med insulin detemir2. Bivirkningsprofilerne var sammenlignelige for Tresiba\u00ae og insulin detemir2. Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) er en basalinsulin til dosering \u00e9n gang dagligt med en lang virkningsvarighed p\u00e5 mere end 42 timer3,[4]. Det er vigtigt for mennesker med type 1- og type 2-diabetes at etablere en rutine for deres insulinbehandling, men i situationer, hvor det ikke er muligt at tage insulin p\u00e5 samme tidspunkt af dagen, giver Tresiba\u00ae mulighed for fleksibilitet med hensyn til injektionstidspunktet3,[5],[6]. Tresiba\u00ae er godkendt i Argentina, Aruba, Aserbajdsjan, Bangladesh, Bosnien & Hercegovina, Brasilien, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, EU, Forenede Arabiske Emirater, Honduras, Hongkong, Island, Israel, Indien, Japan, Kasakhstan, Libanon, Lichtenstein, Makedonien, Mexico, Nepal, Norge, Rusland, Schweiz og Sydkorea.

H\u00e6mofili er en kronisk, arvelig bl\u00f8dersygdom, som prim\u00e6rt rammer m\u00e6nd. Mennesker med h\u00e6mofili A mangler helt eller delvist koagulationsfaktor VIII, som er et af de proteiner, der normalt findes i blodet og er n\u00f8dvendige for, at blodet kan st\u00f8rkne. Mennesker med h\u00e6mofili A har tendens til at bl\u00f8de i l\u00e6ngere tid end normalt eller til at f\u00e5 indre bl\u00f8dninger i muskler, led eller organer, fordi de mangler denne koagulationsfaktor. For at behandle sygdommen og standse bl\u00f8dninger hos mennesker med h\u00e6mofili A er det n\u00f8dvendigt at tilf\u00f8re den manglende koagulationsfaktor VIII ved intraven\u00f8s injektion, dvs. indspr\u00f8jtning i en vene.[5]  Det sk\u00f8nnes, at der p\u00e5 verdensplan er flere end 400.000 mennesker med h\u00e6mofili.[6] Sygdommen er st\u00e6rkt underdiagnosticeret i udviklingslandene.

Data for the recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) product NovoEight\u00ae were presented at the 56th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH).1 The post hoc analysis from the guardian(TM)2 trial further found that, when continued on treatment with NovoEight\u00ae, adults and adolescents showed reductions of 69% and 63%, respectively, in ABR compared with their ABRs from guardian(TM)1. The guardian(TM)1 trial (along with guardian(TM)3) showed that NovoEight\u00ae was efficacious in preventing and reducing bleeds with no confirmed inhibitor development in 213 previously treated patients.2,3 \"This post hoc analysis gives an indication that patients with high baseline bleed rate can benefit from prophylaxis with NovoEight\u00ae, as well as patients who maintain low ABR,\" said Margareth Ozelo, M.D., Ph.D., Hemocentre, IHTC, University of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and lead investigator.  The most common adverse reactions (=>0.5%) seen in the study were injection site reactions, increased hepatic enzymes, and fever.4  About NovoEight\u00ae NovoEight\u00ae is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (October 2013) and the European Medicines Agency (November 2013) for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A. NovoEight\u00ae is also approved in Japan (January 2014), Australia (January 2014), and Switzerland (February 2014), and applications for regulatory approvals have been submitted in a range of other countries. About guardian(TM) The pivotal guardian(TM) clinical programme is one of the largest and most comprehensive preregistration clinical trial programmes in haemophilia, with more than 210 patients with severe haemophilia A treated. The guardian(TM)2 trial is an extension of the clinical programme. The post hoc analysis of the guardian(TM)2 trial involved 166 patients who had participated in guardian(TM)2 and either guardian(TM)1 or 3, had <=1 week of surgery treatment in guardian(TM)1 or 3 (initial period), and had =>3 months of exposure to turoctocog alfa prophylaxis during a selected time period (1 January 2012-30 June 2013) in guardian(TM)2. About Haemophilia A Haemophilia is a chronic, inherited bleeding disorder that primarily affects males. People with haemophilia A are either missing or have a malfunctioning factor VIII protein, which is essential for proper blood clotting. People with haemophilia A have a tendency to bleed longer than most or to bleed internally into muscles, joints or organs because they are missing this clotting factor. To manage the disease and stop bleeding, people with haemophilia A must replace the missing factor VIII protein, which is accomplished by intravenous injection of the clotting factor.5 Globally, it is estimated that more than 400,000 people have haemophilia.6 The disease is severely underdiagnosed in developing countries. About Novo Nordisk Headquartered in Denmark, Novo Nordisk is a global healthcare company with more than 90 years of innovation and leadership in diabetes care. The company also has leading positions within haemophilia care, growth hormone therapy and hormone replacement therapy.

Nedsat nyrefunktion er en udfordrende og almindelig senkomplikation ved type 2-diabetes, som kr\u00e6ver hyppig monitorering af blodsukkerniveau og nyrefunktion. Afh\u00e6ngig af alder, hvor l\u00e6nge man har haft diabetes, og hvor velreguleret blodsukkeret er, vil op til 40% af mennesker med type 2-diabetes udvikle nedsat nyrefunktion i en eller anden grad.[1] \"Det er meget almindeligt, at mennesker med type 2-diabetes har nedsat nyrefunktion, og der findes et begr\u00e6nset udvalg af blodsukkers\u00e6nkende l\u00e6gemidler til behandling af mennesker med begge tilstande,\" siger Melanie Davies, professor i diabetesmedicin, overl\u00e6ge ved Diabetes Research Centre, University of Leicester, Storbritannien, og fors\u00f8gsansvarlig i studiet. \"Den udvidede anvendelse giver l\u00e6gerne en ekstra mulighed for at hj\u00e6lpe patienter med type 2-diabetes og moderat nedsat nyrefunktion med at opn\u00e5 en god blodsukkerregulering.\" CHMP's anbefaling af Victoza\u00ae er baseret p\u00e5 effekt- og sikkerhedsdata fra det kliniske fase 3b-studie LIRA-RENAL.

Ligesom naturligt GLP-1 virker Victoza\u00ae ved at stimulere betacellerne til at frigive insulin og ved at undertrykke glukagonsekretionen fra alfacellerne, n\u00e5r blodsukkerniveauet er h\u00f8jt. Som f\u00f8lge af denne glukoseafh\u00e6ngige virkningsmekanisme er Victoza\u00ae forbundet med en lav forekomst af hypoglyk\u00e6mi (lavt blodsukker)*. Victoza\u00ae reducerer desuden legemsv\u00e6gt og kropsfedtmasse gennem mekanismer, der involverer reduceret appetit og mindre madindtag. Victoza\u00ae er ikke godkendt til v\u00e6gtregulering hos mennesker, som ikke har type 2-diabetes. Victoza\u00ae blev lanceret i EU i 2009 og er p\u00e5 markedet i flere end 70 lande med over 2,3 mio. patient\u00e5rs eksponering hos mennesker med type 2-diabetes globalt. I Europa er Victoza\u00ae godkendt til regulering af blodsukkerniveauet hos voksne med type 2-diabetes som till\u00e6gsbehandling til diabetesl\u00e6gemidler i tabletform og\/eller basal insulin, n\u00e5r blodsukkeret ikke kan holdes tilstr\u00e6kkeligt under kontrol med disse l\u00e6gemidler i kombination med motion og di\u00e6t.[4] I USA blev Victoza\u00ae godkendt den 25. januar 2010 som supplement til di\u00e6t og motion med det form\u00e5l at forbedre blodsukkerreguleringen hos voksne med type 2-diabetes.[5] *\u00a0Hypoglyk\u00e6mi er prim\u00e6rt observeret, n\u00e5r Victoza\u00ae kombineres med et sulfonylurinstof.

","576":"Copenhagen, Denmark, 21 November 2014 - The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) today issued a positive opinion for the use of Victoza\u00ae (liraglutide) in adults with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment. Once the European Commission approves the label expansion, physicians in the European Union will be able to prescribe Victoza\u00ae, the once-daily human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue, to adults with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment without dose adjustments. Renal impairment is a challenging and common long-term complication of type 2 diabetes that requires frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels and kidney function. Depending on age, duration of diabetes and blood glucose control, up to 40% of people with type 2 diabetes will develop some degree of renal impairment.[1] \"Renal impairment is very common in patients with type 2 diabetes, and the choice of glucose-lowering therapies available to people with both conditions is limited\", said Melanie Davies, professor of Diabetes Medicine and honorary consultant, Diabetes Research Centre, University of Leicester, UK and clinical trial investigator. \"This label update gives physicians an additional treatment option to help their patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment achieve glycaemic control.\" The CHMP recommendation for Victoza\u00ae was based on efficacy and safety data from the LIRA-RENAL phase 3b clinical trial. About the LIRA-RENAL study The 26-week, double-blind, randomised, controlled study investigated the efficacy and safety of Victoza\u00ae compared with placebo when added to pre-existing oral antidiabetic treatment, insulin or a combination thereof in adults with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment.[2] Study results include:[3] About Victoza\u00ae Victoza\u00ae (liraglutide) is a human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue with an amino acid sequence 97% similar to endogenous human GLP-1. Like natural GLP-1, Victoza\u00ae works by stimulating the beta cells to release insulin and suppressing glucagon secretion from the alpha cells only when blood sugar levels are high. Due to this glucose-dependent mechanism of action, Victoza\u00ae is associated with a low rate of hypoglycaemia*. In addition, Victoza\u00ae reduces body weight and body fat mass through mechanisms involving reduced appetite and lowered food intake. Victoza\u00ae is not approved for weight management or for use in people who do not have type 2 diabetes. Victoza\u00ae was launched in the EU in 2009 and is commercially available in more than 70 countries with more than 2.3 million patient years of exposure in people with type 2 diabetes globally. In Europe, Victoza\u00ae is indicated for treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes to achieve glycaemic control in combination with oral glucose-lowering medicinal products and\/or basal insulin when these, together with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control.[4]In the US, Victoza\u00ae was approved on 25 January 2010 as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve blood glucose control in adults with type 2 diabetes.[5] *\u00a0Hypoglycaemia has primarily been observed when Victoza\u00ae is combined with a sulfonylurea.

Novo Nordisks placering er et resultat af virksomhedens fokus p\u00e5 'adgang til medicin' som en vigtig del af kerneforretningen. Det omfatter blandt andet en differentieret prispolitik, opbygning af lokale kompetencer samt integrering af velg\u00f8renhed i forretningsaktiviteterne. I 2013 leverede Novo Nordisk medicin til omkring 24,3 millioner mennesker med diabetes overalt i verden - en stigning p\u00e5 7% i forhold til 2012. Ambitionen er nu at sikre adgang til 40 millioner mennesker med diabetes inden 2020. \"I dag bor mere end 80% af verdens diabetikere i lav- og mellemindkomstlande, hvor adgangen til medicin og behandling ikke er tilstr\u00e6kkelig for de mange millioner mennesker med diabetes,\" siger Novo Nordisks administrerende direkt\u00f8r, Lars Rebien S\u00f8rensen. \"Sidste \u00e5r lancerede vi et langsigtet globalt m\u00e5l for adgang til diabetesbehandling, som skal styrke vores igangv\u00e6rende indsats for at nedbryde de barrierer, der hindrer adgangen til sundhed, og hj\u00e6lpe os med at n\u00e5 ud til 40 millioner mennesker med diabetes i 2020.\" Siden Novo Nordisk lancerede sin f\u00f8rste strategi for adgang til sundhed i 2001, er diabetes blevet en stor sundhedsm\u00e6ssig udfordring.

Programmet er iv\u00e6rksat af Novo Nordisk og blev lanceret i Mexico City i marts 2014. Siden har K\u00f8benhavn og senest Houston i USA tilsluttet sig initiativet. If\u00f8lge nye tal fra den internationale diabetesforening, IDF, ansl\u00e5s det, at 387 mio. mennesker i verden har diabetes, og at flere end to tredjedele af dem bor i byomr\u00e5der[1]. P\u00e5 globalt plan er der 2-5 gange st\u00f8rre risiko for at f\u00e5 type 2-diabetes, hvis man bor i en storby[2]. Cities Changing Diabetes er det f\u00f8rste initiativ af sin art, hvis form\u00e5l det er at f\u00e5 offentlige og private organisationer til at arbejde sammen om at finde b\u00e6redygtige l\u00f8sninger p\u00e5 den store udfordring, verdens storbyer st\u00e5r overfor i forhold til udbredelsen af type 2-diabetes. Form\u00e5let med Cities Changing Diabetes er i f\u00f8rste omgang at kortl\u00e6gge problemet, derefter udveksle ideer og bud p\u00e5 l\u00f8sninger og til slut udarbejde konkrete handlingsplaner for de storbyer, der deltager i programmet. Kina har 96 mio. mennesker med diabetes og dermed en af de h\u00f8jeste forekomster af diabetes i verden[3]. Over halvdelen af dem, der har diabetes i Kina, bor i storbyomr\u00e5der, og Shanghai og Tianjin er nogle af de st\u00f8rste storbyer i Kina. Tianjins indbyggertal er fordoblet siden 1995 til omkring 11 mio. mennesker[4], og det ansl\u00e5s, at 9,5% i dag har diabetes[5]. I Shanghai, som har 23,8 mio. indbyggere[6], ansl\u00e5s det, at 12,6% har diabetes[7]. B\u00e5de The People's Municipal Government of Shanghai og Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning er optaget af at tackle den store udfordring, byen st\u00e5r overfor i forhold til den stigende udbredelse af diabetes. Derfor har myndighederne iv\u00e6rksat en r\u00e6kke tiltag for at s\u00e6tte \u00f8get fokus p\u00e5 forebyggelse og behandling af type 2-diabetes og andre kroniske sygdomme. Shanghai hilser derfor alle relevante tiltag, der er baseret p\u00e5 akademisk forskning og innovative partnerskaber, velkomne. I Tianjin g\u00f8r myndighederne en m\u00e5lrettet indsats for at fremme en sund livsstil, hvilket er helt afg\u00f8rende i forhold til at bremse udviklingen i forekomsten af type 2-diabetes. Cities Changing Diabetes passer fint ind de initiativer, National Health and Planning Commission allerede har sat i v\u00e6rk for at bremse udviklingen af type 2-diabetes. Tianjin Medical Association og Shanghai Diabetes Institute vil st\u00e5 i spidsen for den indledende analyse for Cities Changing Diabetes i Kina. Det sker i samarbejde med University College London (UCL) i Storbritannien, der er den globale akademiske partner i programmet. \"Cities Changing Diabetes-partnerskabet vil give et solidt grundlag for at identificere fremtidige initiativer, der kan bidrage til at d\u00e6mme op for v\u00e6ksten af diabetes i Shanghai,\" siger professor Jia Weiping fra Shanghai Diabetes Institute. \"Jeg er sikker p\u00e5, at deltagelsen i Cities Changing Diabetes vil v\u00e6re til gavn for byens forsatte arbejde p\u00e5 at bek\u00e6mpe udbredelsen af type 2-diabetes,\" siger Mr. Xiong Zhi, generalsekret\u00e6r for Tianjin Medical Association. Lars Rebien S\u00f8rensen, administrerende direkt\u00f8r for Novo Nordisk, hilser de to storbyer velkommen i partnerskabet: \"Det er mit h\u00e5b, at vi gennem samarbejdet i Cities Changing Diabetes kan v\u00e6re med til at hj\u00e6lpe de to byer i deres bestr\u00e6belser p\u00e5 at d\u00e6mme op for den k\u00e6mpem\u00e6ssige udfordring, som udbredelsen af type 2-diabetes er, og s\u00e5ledes aktivt v\u00e6re med til at bidrage med l\u00f8sninger til, hvordan dette alvorlige sundhedsproblem bedst tackles.\" Cities Changing Diabetes er et ambiti\u00f8st partnerskabsprogram, der skal d\u00e6mme op for det voksende problem, som den hastige udbredelse af diabetes udg\u00f8r i verdens storbyer. If\u00f8lge nye tal, som International Diabetes Federation (IDF) har offentliggjort i dag, ansl\u00e5s det, at 592 mio. mennesker vil have diabetes i 2035. I dag bor n\u00e6sten to tredjedele af alle med diabetes i storbyerne, og de, der flytter til byen, har betydeligt st\u00f8rre risiko for at udvikle type 2-diabetes end dem, der bliver p\u00e5 landet.

These two major metropolitan centres are the first Chinese cites to become part of the global partnership programme, which was initiated in Mexico City in March 2014, followed by Copenhagen in Europe and Houston in the United States last week. New numbers released today estimate 387 million people worldwide have diabetes today and more than two thirds hereof live in urban areas[1]. Globally, those who live in cities are two to five times more likely to have type 2 diabetes[2]. Cities Changing Diabetes is a first-of-its-kind collaboration to gather public and private partners to identify practical long-term solutions. The programme seeks to understand the root causes behind the rise in type 2 diabetes in cities and use that knowledge to share and recommend effective interventions. With 96 million people with diabetes, China has one of the highest rates of diabetes in the world[3]. More than half of the people with diabetes live in cities, and Shanghai and Tianjin rank among the largest urban areas in China. Tianjin's population has doubled since 1995 to around 11 million people[4] and an estimated 9.5% now suffering from diabetes[5]. In Shanghai, with a population of 23.8[6] million people, it is estimated that 12.6% have diabetes[7]. The People's Municipal Government of Shanghai and the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning are committed to tackle the growing urban diabetes challenge. As a consequence, the city is taking active measures to increase the focus on prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases. Shanghai therefore welcomes relevant input based on academic research and innovative partnerships. In Tianjin, the government is very committed to promoting a healthy lifestyle and a balanced diet, which are key factors in tackling type 2 diabetes. The Cities Changing Diabetes initiative fits well into the National Health and Planning Commission's agenda and will support other initiatives to halt the progress of type 2 diabetes. The Tianjin Medical Association and the Shanghai Diabetes Institute will lead the initial research for Cities Changing Diabetes in collaboration with the global academic institution, University College London (UCL) from the UK. \"The Cities Changing Diabetes partnership will provide a solid foundation for identifying future initiatives of high impact to tackle urban diabetes in Shanghai\" said Professor Jia Weiping of the Shanghai Diabetes institute. \"I am confident the city of Tianjin will benefit significantly in the fight against type 2 diabetes by participating in Cities Changing Diabetes\" said Mr. Xiong Zhi, Secretary General of the Tianjin Medical Association. Lars Rebien S\u00f8rensen, chief executive officer of Novo Nordisk welcomed the global leadership the two significant cities are showing in the fight against urban diabetes: \"It is my hope that by working in partnership through Cities Changing Diabetes, we can complement and support the cities' objective to reduce the growing type 2 diabetes burden and tackle this urgent problem\". Cities Changing Diabetes is an ambitious partnership programme to fight the urban diabetes challenge. According to new numbers released today by the International Diabetes Federation, IDF, it is estimated that 592 million will have diabetes by 2035. Today, nearly two-thirds of all people with diabetes live in cities, and people who move to cities have a significantly higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those who remain in rural settings. The aim of Cities Changing Diabetes is to map the problem in selected urban areas, to share learning and solutions and to drive action to fight the diabetes challenge in cities across the world. University College London (UCL) is the global academic partner for the programme that also includes Steno Diabetes Center, a world-leading institution in diabetes care and prevention in Denmark, and Novo Nordisk.

On this day, employees, partners, people with diabetes and the general public unite with a call to change diabetes. The date, 14 November, was chosen because it is the birthday of Frederick Banting who, along with Charles Best, first conceived the idea which led to the discovery of insulin in 1921. Since the adoption of the United Nations Resolution on diabetes in December 2006, World Diabetes Day has become an official United Nations World Health Day.Read more about the campaign driven by the International Diabetes FederationFor more information on World Diabetes Day 2014 and to join the fight against urban diabetes, visit bit.ly\/urbanwdd or follow @NovoNordisk and use #UrbanDiabetes and\/or #WDD2014 online.

Weight loss associated with liraglutide 3 mg was accompanied by improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as measured by three different questionnaires.[2] Greater improvements were seen with liraglutide 3 mg vs placebo.2 The Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite (IWQoL),[3] total score improved mostly due to better physical function. Both the Short-Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36)[4] summary of physical scores and mental health scores improved.2 \"Obesity is more than a disease of excess weight,\" said Dr Ken Fujioka, Department of Nutrition and Metabolic Research, Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, California and a SCALE(TM) clinical trial investigator. \"We know that people with obesity may experience increased physical and mental health problems, as well as a reduced quality of life. It is encouraging to see data suggesting that the weight loss benefits of liraglutide 3 mg are associated with improved health-related quality of life for people with obesity.\" In addition, the total Treatment Related Impact Measure-Weight (TRIM-W)[5] score was better at 56 weeks with liraglutide 3 mg compared with placebo treatment.2 Obesity is a disease[6] that requires chronic management. It is associated with serious comorbidities including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), certain types of cancer and a decreased life expectancy. The risk of morbidity and mortality increases with the severity of obesity. It is a complex and multi-factorial disease that is influenced by genetic, physiological, environmental and psychological factors. The global increase in the prevalence of obesity is a public health issue that has severe cost implications to healthcare systems. In the US, approximately 35% of adults, equivalent to around 80 million adults, live with obesity.[7],[8] About liraglutide 3 mgLiraglutide 3 mg is a once-daily, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue with 97% similarity to naturally occurring human GLP-1, a hormone that is released in response to food intake.[9] Like human GLP-1, liraglutide 3 mg regulates appetite and food intake by decreasing hunger and increasing feelings of fullness and satiety after eating.[10],[11] The dual actions of liraglutide 3 mg on both appetite and blood glucose regulation (for adults with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes) hold therapeutic potential for adults with obesity, both those with and without type 2 diabetes. Liraglutide 3 mg is an investigational product and is not approved by the FDA or the European Medicines Agency (EMA). About SCALE(TM) Obesity and Prediabetes The SCALE(TM) Obesity and Prediabetes trial[12] is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial in non-diabetic people with obesity and non-diabetic people who are overweight with comorbidities. There were 3,731 participants randomised to treatment with liraglutide 3 mg or placebo in combination with diet and exercise. In addition, participants were further stratified to 56 weeks or 160 weeks of treatment based on prediabetes status at screening. The objectives of this trial were to demonstrate clinically meaningful weight loss at 56 weeks, as well as to investigate the long-term efficacy of liraglutide 3 mg to delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in participants with prediabetes at screening. It is the largest of the phase 3a trials in the SCALE(TM) clinical development programme, which encompassed more than 5,000 people with obesity or people who are overweight with comorbidities.

Det skete p\u00e5 ObesityWeek 2014, den anden f\u00e6lles \u00e5rskongres for The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery og The Obesity Society. 92% (9 ud af 10) af deltagerne i studiet tabte sig ved behandling med liraglutid 3 mg i kombination med di\u00e6t og motion, sammenlignet med 65% ved behandling med placebo.[1] Deltagere, som gennemf\u00f8rte studiet (56 uger), opn\u00e5ede et signifikant st\u00f8rre v\u00e6gttab p\u00e5 9,2% sammenlignet med et v\u00e6gttab p\u00e5 3,5% i placebogruppen (estimeret forskel [ED] 5,7%, p<0,001).1 Endvidere var v\u00e6gttabet med liraglutid 3 mg sammenligneligt p\u00e5 tv\u00e6rs af en r\u00e6kke undergrupper med forskellige grader af overv\u00e6gt ved studiets start, sp\u00e6ndende fra overv\u00e6gt til fedme klasse III[*] efter 56 uger (p=0,054, %; p=0,54, kg), og uafh\u00e6ngigt af status med hensyn til pr\u00e6diabetes ved screening (-8,0% med; -7,9% uden, p=0,59).1 En st\u00f8rre andel af deltagere, der blev behandlet med liraglutid 3 mg, gennemf\u00f8rte studiet sammenlignet med dem, der fik placebo (72% mod 64%).1 Alle behandlingsgrupper fulgte et program med kaloriereduceret di\u00e6t og \u00f8get fysisk aktivitet. V\u00e6gttab i forbindelse med liraglutid 3 mg var ledsaget af forbedret livskvalitet m\u00e5lt ved hj\u00e6lp af tre forskellige sp\u00f8rgeskemaer.[2] Der s\u00e5s st\u00f8rre forbedringer med liraglutid 3 mg sammenlignet med placebo.2 Den samlede score i Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite (IWQoL)[3] forbedredes hovedsagelig p\u00e5 grund af bedre fysisk tilstand. I Short-Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36)[4] forbedredes de summerede scorer b\u00e5de for fysisk helbred og psykisk helbred.2 \"Fedme er ikke bare en sygdom, der handler om, at man vejer for meget,\" siger dr. Ken Fujioka fra Department of Nutrition and Metabolic Research, Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, Californien, som er en af de fors\u00f8gsansvarlige i SCALE(TM) studiet. \"Vi ved, at mange sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtige mennesker ikke bare oplever flere fysiske og psykiske helbredsproblemer, men ogs\u00e5 en forringelse af deres livskvalitet. Det er positivt at se data, der tyder p\u00e5, at v\u00e6gttabsfordelene ved liraglutid 3 mg er associeret med forbedret sundhedsrelateret livskvalitet for sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtige mennesker.\" Endvidere var den samlede score i Treatment Related Impact Measure-Weight (TRIM-W)[5] bedre efter 56 uger med liraglutid 3 mg sammenlignet med placebo.2 Fedme er en sygdom,[6] der kr\u00e6ver kronisk regulering. Den er forbundet med alvorlige komplikationer som type 2-diabetes, hjertesygdom, obstruktiv s\u00f8vnapn\u00f8 og visse former for kr\u00e6ft samt en neds\u00e6ttelse af den forventede levetid. Risikoen for sygelighed (morbiditet) og d\u00f8delighed (mortalitet) stiger i takt med sv\u00e6rhedsgraden af fedme. Det er en kompleks sygdom, der er betinget af flere forskellige forhold, herunder genetiske, fysiologiske, milj\u00f8m\u00e6ssige og psykologiske faktorer. Den globale stigning i forekomsten af fedme er en trussel mod folkesundheden med betydelig indvirkning p\u00e5 sundhedsudgifterne. I USA er ca. 35% af den voksne befolkning - omkring 80 mio. mennesker - sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtige.[7],[8] Liraglutid 3 mg er en GLP-1-analog (glukagonlignende peptid-1) til dosering \u00e9n gang dagligt. Den har 97% lighed med kroppens eget GLP-1, som er et tarmhormon, der frigives, n\u00e5r man spiser.[9] Ligesom naturligt GLP-1 regulerer liraglutid 3 mg appetitten og indtagelsen af mad ved at d\u00e6mpe signaler om sult og \u00f8ge m\u00e6thedsfornemmelsen efter et m\u00e5ltid.[10],[11]Liraglutid 3 mg virker b\u00e5de p\u00e5 appetitten og blodsukkerreguleringen (hos mennesker med pr\u00e6diabetes eller type 2-diabetes) og rummer dermed potentiale til behandling af sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtige voksne med eller uden type 2-diabetes. Liraglutid 3 mg er et produkt under udvikling, og det er ikke godkendt af FDA eller EMA (European Medicines Agency). SCALE(TM) Obesity and Prediabetes[12] er et randomiseret, dobbeltblindet, placebokontrolleret multinationalt studie med sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtige mennesker, der ikke har diabetes, og overv\u00e6gtige mennesker, der ikke har diabetes, men som har komplikationer (komorbiditeter). Studiet omfattede 3.731 deltagere, der blev randomiseret til behandling med liraglutid 3 mg eller placebo i kombination med di\u00e6t og motion. Herudover blev deltagerne yderligere fordelt i grupper til 56 ugers eller 160 ugers behandling baseret p\u00e5 deres status mht. pr\u00e6diabetes ved screening. Studiet havde til form\u00e5l at dokumentere klinisk meningsfuldt v\u00e6gttab efter 56 uger samt at unders\u00f8ge langtidseffekten af liraglutid 3 mg i forhold til at forsinke udviklingen af type 2-diabetes hos deltagere med pr\u00e6diabetes ved screening. Det er det st\u00f8rste af fase 3a-studierne i det kliniske udviklingsprogram SCALE(TM), som omfattede flere end 5.000 deltagere, som er sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtige eller overv\u00e6gtige med komplikationer. Denne information blev pr\u00e6senteret p\u00e5 ObesityWeek 2014, den videnskabelige \u00e5bningsevent for The Obesity Society og American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.

Den nye behandlingsl\u00f8sning, der indeholder Novo Nordisks hurtigtvirkende insulin NovoRapid\u00ae (insulin aspart), ventes at g\u00f8re det mere bekvemt at bruge insulinpumpebehandling, b\u00e5de for brugere og behandlere. Den pr\u00e6fyldte 1,6 ml ampul er udviklet i et ikke-eksklusivt partnerskab mellem Roche Diabetes Care og Novo Nordisk og passer til det nye Accu-Chek\u00ae Insight insulinpumpesystem fra Roche Diabetes Care. \"En af udfordringerne ved at bruge en traditionel pumpe er, at insulinbeholderen skal fyldes manuelt. Det er en omst\u00e6ndelig proces, der ofte opleves som kompleks og tidskr\u00e6vende b\u00e5de af brugerne og deres behandlere,\" siger dr. Parth Narendran, klinisk seniorlektor og honor\u00e6r konsulent i medicin ved University of Birmingham. \"Det kan v\u00e6re en stor hurdle, n\u00e5r man starter p\u00e5 insulinpumpebehandling, og det kr\u00e6ver, at sundhedspersonalet bruger en masse tid p\u00e5 opl\u00e6ring og st\u00f8tte, n\u00e5r pumpebehandlingen p\u00e5begyndes. En enklere proces vil kunne mindske dette problem og give konkrete fordele for de patienter, der i deres dagligdag er afh\u00e6ngige af insulinpumpebehandling for at holde deres diabetes i kontrol,\" forts\u00e6tter han. I forhold til behandling med mange daglige injektioner kan insulinpumpebehandling give st\u00f8rre fleksibilitet i forhold til den enkeltes livsstil og potentielt en strammere blodsukkerregulering uden \u00f8get risiko for lavt blodsukker (hypoglyk\u00e6mi).[1]-[2] \"Det kan medf\u00f8re fordele for visse patienter,\" forklarer dr.

En insulinpumpe tilf\u00f8rer insulin til kroppen fra en beholder i pumpen ved hj\u00e6lp af et infusionss\u00e6t og en meget lille kanyle. Insulinpumper bruger hurtigtvirkende insulin som f.eks. insulin aspart. Insulinen tilf\u00f8res ved kontinuerlig infusion og bruges ofte af mennesker med type 1-diabetes, som f\u00e5r intensiv insulinbehandling og m\u00e5ler deres blodsukker regelm\u00e6ssigt. Insulinpumper er velegnede til visse patienter og giver st\u00f8rre fleksibilitet og potentielt en bedre regulering af blodsukkeret og \u00f8get livskvalitet1-2. I Europa varierer andelen af mennesker med type 1-diabetes, der bruger insulinpumpe, fra mindre end 5% i nogle lande til over 15% i andre lande. I USA er andelen af insulinpumpebrugere 40%[3].

This new treatment solution, which contains NovoRapid\u00ae\u00a0(insulin aspart) - a rapid-acting insulin from Novo Nordisk - is expected to make insulin pump therapy more convenient for people with diabetes and their care staff. The 1.6 ml cartridgeis developedin a non-exclusive partnership between Roche Diabetes Care and Novo Nordisk and is compatible with the\u00a0new Accu-Chek\u00ae\u00a0Insight insulin pump therapy system from Roche Diabetes Care. \"One of the challenges in operating a traditional pump lies in the manual filling of the insulin reservoir, a procedure with multiple steps, which can often be perceived as a complex and time-consuming process by patients and healthcare professionals alike,\" commented Dr Parth Narendran, clinical senior lecturer and honorary consultant in medicine at the University of Birmingham. He continued: \"This can be a difficult hurdle to overcome when starting on insulin pump therapy, and is exacerbated by the extensive amount of time needed by healthcare staff to provide the necessary support during pump initiation. A simpler process could address this issue and deliver tangible benefits for those patients who rely on insulin pump therapy every day to manage their diabetes.\" Compared to multiple daily injections, insulin pumps can provide greater flexibility of lifestyle and potentially tighter blood glucose control without an increased risk of hypoglycaemia.1-2 \"This can provide benefits to certain patients,\" explained Dr Mark Evans, lecturer and honorary consultant in medicine at the University of Cambridge. \"In Europe, we've seen a slow but steady increase in insulin pump therapy uptake in recent years, but there is still room for improvement; in the United Kingdom pumps are currently used by 19% of children and 6% of adults with type 1 diabetes.\" NovoRapid\u00ae\u00a0PumpCart\u00ae\u00a0is being launched in the UK, Sweden and Austria today and will be made available in more European countries throughout 2015 and 2016. The Accu-Chek\u00ae\u00a0Insight insulin pump\u00a0therapy system has been launched in Austria in the first half of this year and is being launched in the UK today, with other European markets following throughout 2015. An insulin pump delivers insulin from a reservoir inside the pump to a patient's body using an infusion set and a tiny cannula. Insulin pumps use fast-acting insulin such as insulin aspart. The insulin is delivered using continuous infusion and is often used by people with type 1 diabetes who receive intensified insulin therapy and test their blood glucose levels on a regular basis. An insulin pump is suitable for certain patients and provides more flexibility, with the potential to improve glycaemic control and quality of life1-2. In Europe, use of insulin pumps among people with type 1 diabetes varies with less than 5% using a pump in some countries to more than 15% in other countries. In the US, 40% are treated with insulin from a pump3.

Houston er den tredje by i verden og den f\u00f8rste i USA, der tilslutter sig initiativet Cities Changing Diabetes, som Novo Nordisk lancerede tidligere p\u00e5 \u00e5ret. De f\u00f8rste to byer er Mexico City og K\u00f8benhavn. Af de ansl\u00e5et omkring 382 millioner mennesker i verden med diabetes bor n\u00e6sten to tredjedele i byomr\u00e5der.[1] Globalt set er der 2-5 gange st\u00f8rre risiko for at have diabetes, hvis man bor i en storby.[2] Cities Changing Diabetes er det f\u00f8rste initiativ af sin art, der har til form\u00e5l at bek\u00e6mpe den stigende udbredelse af diabetes i verdens storbyer gennem praktiske, langsigtede l\u00f8sninger. Parterne arbejder sammen om i f\u00f8rste omgang at forst\u00e5, hvad der ligger bag v\u00e6ksten, og derefter bruge den viden til at udarbejde konkrete, realiserbare handlingsplaner. \"Diabetes og fedme er en stor trussel mod folkesundheden i vores by,\" udtaler Houstons borgmester Annise D. Parker. \"Cities Changing Diabetes er en unik mulighed for at udarbejde sundhedsstrategier, der tager kampen op mod diabetes p\u00e5 en m\u00e5de, der passer til befolkningen i Houston og Harris County. Vi ser frem til at samarbejde med partnere b\u00e5de lokalt og globalt om at udvikle l\u00f8sninger p\u00e5, hvordan vi bek\u00e6mper denne globale epidemi.\" Som f\u00f8rste skridt i Cities Changing Diabetes-initiativet gennemf\u00f8res en omfattende analyse for at afd\u00e6kke de v\u00e6sentligste \u00e5rsager til udvikling af diabetes. Resultaterne af denne analyse anvendes til i samarbejde med lokale interessenter at identificere, hvilke tiltag der virker bedst i forhold til at forebygge og behandle diabetes. De bedste l\u00f8sninger deles dern\u00e6st med andre storbyer i verden. De f\u00f8rste data fra Houston vil foreligge i starten af 2015. \"Houston er en ideel partner, fordi der er et stort \u00f8nske om at forbedre sundheden for byens indbyggere. Det fremg\u00e5r af de mange st\u00e6rke initiativer, der allerede er sat i s\u00f8en for at tage kampen op mod alvorlige sundhedsproblemer som for eksempel diabetes,\" siger Lars Rebien S\u00f8rensen, administrerende direkt\u00f8r for Novo Nordisk. \"Det er tvingende n\u00f8dvendigt, at beslutningstagere, sundhedsmyndigheder, forskere, non-profit-organisationer og private virksomheder arbejder sammen om at udvikle l\u00f8sninger, der kan d\u00e6mme op for v\u00e6ksten i diabetes i storbyerne. Vi vil arbejde sammen med vores partnere i Houston og andre steder i verden om at finde frem til l\u00f8sninger og s\u00e6tte gang i en f\u00e6lles indsats.\" Sundhedsforvaltningen i Houston (The Health & Human Services Department) og University of Texas' fakultet for folkesundhed (School of Public Health) er Novo Nordisks centrale partnere i projektet og skal st\u00e5 i spidsen for den indledende analyse i Houston. De \u00f8vrige lokale partnere er Harris County Healthcare Alliance, American Diabetes Association Houston og Clinton Health Matters Initiative. P\u00e5 globalt plan vil initiativet f\u00e5 st\u00f8tte fra det britiske University College London (UCL) og Steno Diabetes Center i Danmark, en af verdens f\u00f8rende institutioner indenfor diabetesbehandling og -forebyggelse, foruden Novo Nordisk. Houston er USA's fjerdest\u00f8rste by med 2,1 mio. indbyggere i selve byen og 4,3 mio. i Harris County.[3] Ca. \u00e9n ud af 10 voksne i Houston\/Harris County har diabetes.[4] Fedme er den mest almindelige kroniske sygdom i Houston, som ber\u00f8rer 32% af byens voksne indbyggere.[5] Sv\u00e6rt overv\u00e6gtige m\u00e6nd og kvinder har henholdsvis 7 og 12 gange st\u00f8rre risiko for at udvikle diabetes.[6] Som borgmester anerkender Annise D. Parker, at der skal handling til, og hun har derfor sat s\u00e6rligt fokus p\u00e5 at forbedre indbyggernes sundhed og trivsel i Houston. I 2012 lancerede hun Healthy Houston, som er et initiativ rettet mod at mindske udbredelsen af fedme og fremme sunde kostvaner og motion. Healthy Houston st\u00f8tter initiativer, strategier og aktioner, der skal mindske de s\u00e5kaldte 'food deserts' (omr\u00e5der, hvor der ikke er mulighed for at k\u00f8be friske r\u00e5varer) samt fremme tilg\u00e6ngeligheden af lokalt dyrkede f\u00f8devarer, udviklingen af b\u00e6redygtige f\u00f8devaresystemer og rekreative muligheder. Cities Changing Diabetes er et ambiti\u00f8st partnerskabsprogram, der skal d\u00e6mme op for det voksende problem, som den hastige udbredelse af diabetes udg\u00f8r i verdens storbyer. Det ansl\u00e5s, at mere end en halv milliard mennesker vil have diabetes i 2030. I dag bor n\u00e6sten to tredjedele af alle med diabetes i storbyerne, og de, der flytter til byen, har betydelig st\u00f8rre risiko for at f\u00e5 diabetes end dem, der bliver p\u00e5 landet.[7] Form\u00e5let med Cities Changing Diabetes er i f\u00f8rste omgang at kortl\u00e6gge problemet, derefter udveksle ideer og bud p\u00e5 l\u00f8sninger og til slut udarbejde konkrete handlingsplaner for de storbyer, der deltager i programmet.

Houston is the third city globally and the first in the United States to join the Cities Changing Diabetes programme, which was initiated earlier in 2014 by Novo Nordisk. The first two cities are Mexico City and Copenhagen. Of the estimated 382 million people worldwide who have diabetes, nearly two thirds live in urban areas.[1] Globally, those who live in cities are two to five times more likely to have diabetes.[2] Cities Changing Diabetes is a first-of-its-kind collaboration developed to stem the tide of urban diabetes by providing practical, long-term solutions. The partnership aims to tackle the challenge by first understanding the driving factors behind the rise in diabetes in cities and use that knowledge to share concrete, real-world solutions. \"Diabetes and obesity pose a significant health threat to our city,'' said Houston Mayor Annise D. Parker. \"Cities Changing Diabetes is a unique opportunity to identify the health strategies that combat diabetes in a way that meet the individual needs of the people of Houston and Harris County. We look forward to collaborating with partners locally and around the world to develop solutions to this global epidemic.'' The Cities Changing Diabetes programme will kick off with a comprehensive analysis of the major gaps and vulnerabilities associated with diabetes. The results will be used in collaboration with local stakeholders to identify efforts that will have the greatest impact on prevention and management of diabetes. The best practices will then be shared with cities around the world. Initial data on Houston will be available in early 2015. \"The City of Houston is an ideal partner as there is a strong commitment to improving health, which is seen with several strong programmes already in existence to combat major health issues such as diabetes,\" said Lars Rebien S\u00f8rensen, chief executive officer of Novo Nordisk. \"It is urgent that policymakers, health authorities, academia, the non-profit sector and private industry work together to develop solutions to reverse the rise of urban diabetes. We are committed to working with our partners in Houston and around the world to identify solutions and spur concerted action.'' The Houston Health & Human Services Department and The University of Texas School of Public Health serve as core partners on the project and will lead the initial research for Cities Changing Diabetes in Houston. Other local partners include the Harris County Healthcare Alliance, American Diabetes Association Houston and the Clinton Health Matters Initiative. Globally, the programme will be supported by University College London (UCL), UK and Steno Diabetes Center, Denmark, a world-leading institution in diabetes care and prevention, and Novo Nordisk. DIABETES IN HOUSTON Houston is the fourth largest city in the United States. There are 2.1 million people living in Houston and 4.3 million in Harris County.[3] Approximately one in 10 adults in Houston\/Harris County have diabetes.[4] Obesity is the most common chronic condition in Houston, affecting 32% of adults.[5] Men and women with obesity have a 7- and 12-fold risk, respectively, of developing diabetes.[6] Recognising the need for action, Mayor Parker has dedicated significant attention to improving health and wellness in Houston. In 2012, she launched Healthy Houston, an initiative designed to reduce obesity and increase healthy eating and exercise. Healthy Houston promotes programmes, policies and actions designed to reduce food deserts, promote the availability of locally grown foods, encourage the development of sustainable food systems and promote recreational opportunities. About Cities Changing DiabetesCities Changing Diabetes is an ambitious partnership programme to fight the urban diabetes challenge. By 2030, it is estimated that more than half a billion people will have diabetes. Today, nearly two-thirds of all people with diabetes live in cities, and people who move to cities have a significantly higher risk of developing diabetes than those who remain in rural settings.[7] The aim of Cities Changing Diabetes is to map the problem, share solutions and drive concrete action to fight the diabetes challenge in selected focus cities across the world.

The Obesity Research Unit will be co-located with the Novo Nordisk Type 1 Diabetes Research Unit at the company's research centre in Seattle, which opened in 2009. Obesity is a disease[i] that requires chronic management. It is associated with serious comorbidities including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), certain types of cancer and a decreased life expectancy[ii][iii][iv]. The risk of morbidity and mortality increases with the severity of obesity. It is a complex and multi-factorial disease that is influenced by genetic, physiological, environmental and psychological factors[v]. The global increase in the prevalence of obesity is a public health issue that has severe cost implications to healthcare systems. In the US, approximately 35% of adults, or some 100 million people, live with obesity[vi]. Visit novonordisk.com for photos and b-roll supporting this press release.

The authorisation covers all 27 European Union member states. Company announcement No 58 \/ 2014","599":"Vienna, Austria, Thursday 18 September 2014 - Data presented today at the 50th Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) show that Ryzodeg\u00ae (insulin degludec\/insulin aspart) administered twice daily, provides successful glycaemic control with fewer injections than a basal-bolus regimen1[*]. Ryzodeg\u00ae is a combination of two distinct insulin analogues (insulin degludec and insulin aspart in the ratio of 70% and 30%), making it the first combination of a basal insulin with an ultra-long duration of action and a well-established mealtime insulin in one pen for people with type 2 diabetes2-4. \"Patients currently using basal-bolus regimens may need to take up to four daily injections, which can be a great burden and very inconvenient. Ryzodeg\u00ae is a new treatment option which provides proven glycaemic control, with fewer injections and reduced rates of hypoglycaemia compared to basal-bolus regimens,\" said Dr Helena Rodbard, the study's principal investigator and endocrinologist in Rockville, MD, USA. \"This new treatment offers the potential for a simple alternative to basal-bolus for patients who require intensification of basal insulin regimens,\" she added. The study presented at EASD was a 26-week randomised multinational phase 3b trial, where patients previously treated with basal insulin were randomised to a regimen of either twice daily Ryzodeg\u00ae, or a basal-bolus regimen of once-daily insulin degludec plus two to four injections of insulin aspart1. The studydid not meet its primary endpoint of non-inferiority; however, the results showed that HbA1c was reduced for patients on either regimen, to 7.0% and 6.8% respectively, with no significant difference between the two regimens1. Patients who received Ryzodeg\u00ae experienced a numerically lower rate of overall and nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes1, 19% and 20% less, respectively. They also gained significantly less weight (p<0.05) over the course of the study and used a significantly lower daily insulin dose1 (12%; p<0.05) versus the basal-bolus regimen. Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease5, which means some patients will need to intensify insulin treatment eventually by adding mealtime insulin - bolus therapy \u00ad- to achieve or maintain their glycaemic targets over time5. Studies have shown that more than 50% of people with type 2 diabetes on basal insulin alone are not achieving their glycaemic targets as measured by HbA1c6-8. Complications from diabetes caused by failing to keep optimal glycaemic control can be serious and may include problems such as heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease, nerve damage and premature mortality9,10. About Ryzodeg\u00aeRyzodeg\u00ae is a combination of two distinct insulin analogues, insulin degludec and insulin aspart in the ratio of 70% and 30%. In a multinational trial, Ryzodeg\u00ae delivered twice daily at main meals offered a successful reduction in HbA1c2,4 with lower risk of hypoglycaemia versus biphasic insulin aspart 30 in people with type 2 diabetes4. In other studies no apparent differences were shown between Ryzodeg\u00ae and its comparators, with respect to adverse events and standard safety parameters4,11-13. Ryzodeg\u00ae has been approved in Aruba, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador, the EU, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Israel, Japan, Kazakhstan, Macedonia, Mexico, Norway, Russia, South Korea and Switzerland. About the clinical trial programmeThe clinical trial programmes for insulin degludec (BEGIN\u00ae) and Ryzodeg\u00ae (BOOST\u00ae) comprise the largest in the field of insulin therapy, with more than 11,000 people included. Novo Nordisk completed the phase 3a BOOST\u00ae programme in 2010. This programme consisted of six randomised, controlled, treat-to-target trials in more than 30 countries. More than 2,000 people were included in the development programme. The programme was designed after consultancy with regulatory agencies in Europe, Japan and USA.

Studiet opfyldte ikke det prim\u00e6re m\u00e5lepunkt om ikke-inferi\u00f8ritet, men resultaterne viste, at langtidsblodsukkeret (HbA1c) blev reduceret for deltagerne i begge behandlingsgrupper, til henholdsvis 7,0% og 6,8%, uden signifikant forskel mellem de to behandlingsformer1. Deltagere, der fik Ryzodeg\u00ae, oplevede en numerisk lavere forekomst af generel og natlig bekr\u00e6ftet hypoglyk\u00e6mi1, henholdsvis 19% og 20% f\u00e6rre episoder. De tog ogs\u00e5 signifikant mindre p\u00e5 i v\u00e6gt (p<0,05) i l\u00f8bet af studiet og brugte en signifikant lavere daglig insulindosis1 (12%; p<0,05) sammenlignet med basal-bolusbehandlingen. Type 2-diabetes er en progressiv sygdom5. Det betyder, at nogle patienter med tiden er n\u00f8dt til at intensivere deres insulinbehandling ved ogs\u00e5 at tage m\u00e5ltidsinsulin, ogs\u00e5 kaldet bolusinsulin, for at n\u00e5 eller fastholde deres blodsukkerm\u00e5l5. Studier har vist, at over 50% af alle med type 2-diabetes i behandling med basal insulin alene ikke n\u00e5r de anbefalede m\u00e5l for langtidsblodsukkeret6-8. D\u00e5rlig blodsukkerregulering kan medf\u00f8re alvorlige diabetiske f\u00f8lgesygdomme som hjertekarsygdom, slagtilf\u00e6lde, blindhed, nyresygdom og nerveskader samt for tidlig d\u00f8d9,10.

The study investigates once-daily Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) versus insulin detemir, both in combination with bolus insulin aspart in a 52-week trial in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. This trial is the first to look into the long-term safety of Tresiba\u00ae in children and adolescents (from age 1 to less than 18 years). The results show that Tresiba\u00ae in combination with insulin aspart effectively improved long-term glycaemic control1. \"When treating children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, it is critical that the right balance between glycaemic control and side effect management is maintained to ensure the best possible long-term outcomes. These data show that Tresiba\u00ae has the potential to offer youngsters with diabetes a new treatment option, which may help them achieve better control of their diabetes,\" said Dr Nandu Thalange, paediatric endocrinologist at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, Norwich, United Kingdom. The BEGIN\u00ae YOUNG 1 trial was a randomised controlled, 26 week open-label, treat-to-target trial (with a 26-week extension) investigating the efficacy and safety of Tresiba\u00ae, given once daily, and insulin detemir, given once or twice daily, both in combination with bolus insulin aspart in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Tresiba\u00ae met the primary endpoint of non-inferiority to insulin detemir for mean change in HbA1c (p<0.05) at 26 weeks. In the 26-week extension a lower insulin dose and a significantly greater reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG*) versus insulin detemir (p<0.05) was achieved1. Both regimens had similar rates of overall and nocturnal hypoglycaemia, the rate of severe hypoglycaemia was numerically higher with insulin degludec plus insulin aspart1. Of note, patients on Tresiba\u00ae had significantly lower rates of hyperglycaemia with ketosis (p<0.05)1. Weight (measured as SD score[**]) increased with Tresiba\u00ae and remained unchanged with insulin detemir1. Adverse event profiles were similar for insulin degludec and insulin detemir1. About Tresiba\u00ae Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) is a once-daily basal insulin that provides an ultra-long duration of action beyond 42 hours2,3. It is important for people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes to establish a routine for insulin treatment. \u00a0On occasions when administration at the same time of day is not possible, Tresiba\u00ae allows for flexibility in day-to-day dosing time3-5. Tresiba\u00ae has received regulatory approval in Argentina, Aruba, Bangladesh, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, the EU, Honduras, Hong Kong, Iceland, Israel, India, Japan, Kazakhstan, Lichtenstein, Lebanon, Macedonia, Mexico, Nepal, Norway, South Korea, Switzerland and Russia.

Desuden havde patienter, der blev behandlet med Tresiba\u00ae, en signifikant lavere forekomst af hyperglyk\u00e6mi (h\u00f8jt blodsukker) med ketose (p<0,05)1. V\u00e6gten (m\u00e5lt som SD-score**) steg med Tresiba\u00ae og forblev u\u00e6ndret med insulin detemir1. Bivirknings\u00adprofilerne var sammenlignelige for insulin degludec og insulin detemir1. Tresiba\u00ae (insulin degludec) er en basal insulin til dosering \u00e9n gang dagligt med en lang virkningsvarighed p\u00e5 mere end 42 timer2,3. Det er vigtigt for mennesker med type 1- og type 2-diabetes at etablere en rutine for deres insulinbehandling, men i situationer, hvor det ikke er muligt at tage insulin p\u00e5 samme tidspunkt af dagen, giver Tresiba\u00ae mulighed for fleksibilitet med hensyn til injektionstidspunktet3-5.

Novo Nordisk afsluttede fase 3a-programmet BOOST\u00ae i 2010. Det bestod af seks randomiserede, kontrollerede treat to target-studier i flere end 30 lande. Programmet omfattede flere end 2.000 deltagere og var tilrettelagt i samr\u00e5d med de regulatoriske myndigheder i Europa, Japan og USA.

Ryzodeg\u00ae is a combination of two distinct insulin analogues (insulin degludec and insulin aspart in the ratio of 70% and 30%), making it the first combination of a basal insulin with an ultra-long duration of action and a well-established mealtime insulin in one pen for people with type 2 diabetes1-3. Ryzodeg\u00ae offers adults with type 2 diabetes successful reductions in HbA1c1,3-5, with lower risk of hypoglycaemia versus biphasic insulin aspart 303,4[*]. As Ryzodeg\u00ae is a combination product it requires fewer daily injections than administering basal and mealtime insulin in separate injections. \"Ryzodeg\u00ae is a new approach to diabetes management, and we are very pleased to make it available now for people with diabetes. Ryzodeg\u00ae has documented excellent glucose control and a low risk of hypoglycaemia in clinical trials, and it represents an excellent opportunity for intensification of insulin treatment with fewer injections than other treatment options,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk. Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease6, which means some patients will need to eventually intensify insulin treatment by adding mealtime insulin - bolus therapy - to achieve or maintain their glycaemic targets over time6. Studies have shown that more than 50% of people with type 2 diabetes on basal insulin are not achieving their glycaemic targets as measured by HbA1c7-9. Complications from diabetes caused by failing to keep optimal glycaemic control can be serious, and may include problems such as heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease, nerve damage and premature mortality10,11. In Mexico, where 8.7 million people live with diabetes12, the number of diabetes-related deaths was 70,281 in 201313. Novo Nordisk expects to make Ryzodeg\u00ae available in additional countries around the world within the next year. In a multinational trial, Ryzodeg\u00ae (insulin degludec\/insulin aspart) delivered twice daily at main meals offered a successful reduction in HbA1c1,3 with lower risk of hypoglycaemia versus biphasic insulin aspart 30 in people with type 2 diabetes, showing a3: In other studies no apparent differences were shown between Ryzodeg\u00ae and its comparators, with respect to adverse events and standard safety parameters3,5,14,15. Ryzodeg\u00ae has been approved in Aruba, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador, the EU, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Israel, Japan, Kazakhstan, Macedonia, Mexico, Norway, Russia, South Korea and Switzerland. The clinical trial programmes for insulin degludec (BEGIN\u00ae) and Ryzodeg\u00ae (BOOST\u00ae) comprise the largest in the field of insulin therapy, including more than 11,000 people. Novo Nordisk completed the phase 3a BOOST\u00ae programme in 2010. This programme consisted of six randomised, controlled, treat-to-target trials in more than 30 countries. More than 2000 people were included in the development programme. The programme was designed after consultancy with regulatory agencies in Europe, Japan and USA. Headquartered in Denmark, Novo Nordisk is a global healthcare company with more than 90 years of innovation and leadership in diabetes care. The company also has leading positions within haemophilia care, growth hormone therapy and hormone replacement therapy. Novo Nordisk employs approximately 40,700 employees in 75 countries, and markets its products in more than 180 countries.

Reported operating profit increased by 32% to DKK 29.5 billion including a 1.7 percentage points improvement in the gross margin. Measured in local currencies, operating profit increased by 20%. Net profit increased by 25% to DKK 21.4 billion. Earnings per share (diluted) increased by 30% to DKK 38.85. Novo Nordisk has in December 2012 received, and submitted its response to, a Warning Letter from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in relation to an inspection of an aseptic filling facility in Denmark. Novo Nordisk does not expect the letter to have an impact on products currently marketed in the US. The regulatory process for the new-generation insulins, Tresiba\u00ae and Ryzodeg\u00ae, continues to progress in the major markets. In Japan and Europe both products have now been approved. In November 2012, an FDA Advisory Committee voted eight to four in favour of approving the products with a post-approval outcomes trial commitment. In 2012, Novo Nordisk reached its four long-term financial targets. Consequently, two of the four targets have been increased. The core target of 15% annual operating profit growth on average is maintained. For 2013, sales growth measured in local currencies is expected to be 8-11%, and operating profit growth measured in local currencies is expected to be around 10%. Effective 31 January 2013, Novo Nordisk's Executive Management is expanded with two new members who will be responsible for Marketing & Medical Affairs and IT, Quality & Corporate Development respectively. At the Annual General Meeting on 20 March 2013, the Board of Directors will propose a 29% increase in dividend to DKK 18 per share. The Board of Directors has furthermore decided to initiate a new 12 months share repurchase programme of up to DKK 14 billion.

Novo Nordisk n\u00e5ede sine langsigtede finansielle m\u00e5l i 2012. To af de fire m\u00e5l er derfor blevet opjusteret.

Following the US approval of Victoza\u00ae for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, Novo Nordisk has been in dialogue with the FDA regarding the further progression of the development programme investigating the potential of liraglutide within obesity. Based on the feedback from the FDA, Novo Nordisk now plans to re-initiate the global phase 3 programme in the first half of 2011 in clinical trials comprising approximately 5,000 patients. The re-initiation of liraglutide obesity trials underlines Novo Nordisk's dedication to the development of the liraglutide portfolio, that is the cardiovascular outcomes trial for Victoza\u00ae (LEADER(TM)), the obesity programme, the fixed-ratio combination of insulin degludec and liraglutide, and finally a once-weekly version of liraglutide.Novo Nordisk remains committed to the development of a longer-acting GLP-1 analogue and now expects to outline the clinical development strategy for semaglutide, a once-weekly GLP-1 analogue, and the once-weekly version of liraglutide in the second half of 2011. Once-daily Victoza\u00ae is the first human GLP-1 (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1) analogue developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Victoza\u00ae lowers blood glucose by stimulating the release of insulin and lowering of glucagon secretion when blood sugar levels are high and also by slowing gastric emptying. Victoza\u00ae also reduces body weight and body fat mass through mechanisms involving reduced hunger and lowered energy intake. Victoza\u00ae is a once-daily injection taken any time of day independent of meals.Novo Nordisk received marketing authorisation for Victoza\u00ae on 30 June 2009 in the EU, 20 January 2010 in Japan and 25 January 2010 in the US. It has been launched in the US, Canada, Japan, India, UK, Germany, France and several other European markets.

Victoza\u00ae is the brand name approved in the US and Europe for liraglutide, the first once-daily human Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In the US, Victoza\u00ae is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. This provides for Victoza\u00ae to be used in monotherapy, as second-line treatment and in combination with commonly prescribed oral medications for diabetes. \"The US approval of Victoza\u00ae represents a major advancement in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and is an important milestone for Novo Nordisk that follows the recent approval in Japan and the ongoing successful launch in Europe.\" says Lars Rebien S\u00f8rensen, president and CEO. \"We are convinced that Victoza\u00ae will prove to be a valuable treatment option for people with type 2 diabetes in the US. The ability of Victoza\u00ae to substantially improve glucose control with a low risk of hypoglycaemia creates an opportunity for more patients with type 2 diabetes to achieve their individual treatment goals.\" Novo Nordisk expects to introduce Victoza\u00ae in the US market within weeks. The Victoza\u00ae phase 3 clinical trial programme, entitled LEAD(TM), which formed the basis of the regulatory submission, is comprised of randomised, controlled, double-blinded studies comparing Victoza\u00ae to commonly prescribed treatments. These multinational trials evaluated Victoza\u00ae in monotherapy as well as in combination with one or two oral antidiabetic medications and showed better or equivalent lowering of blood glucose than active comparators such as sulphonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Unlike many other diabetes medications, Victoza\u00ae is not associated with weight gain. For patients with type 2 diabetes, clinical trial data demonstrate a reduction in body weight in the LEAD(TM) programme. Body weight was a secondary endpoint in the clinical development trials. The most common adverse events reported during the clinical development programme in patients treated with Victoza\u00ae were associated with the gastrointestinal system. Gastrointestinal adverse events, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were reported most frequently in the early part of the treatment period with Victoza\u00ae and few patients withdrew due to these adverse events. The US prescribing information includes a boxed warning for the risk of thyroid c-cell tumours. In preclinical testing, Victoza\u00ae caused thyroid c-cell tumours in rodents. In clinical trials there were no reported cases of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) in patients treated with Victoza\u00ae, but human relevance of the rodent findings could not be ruled out by clinical or non-clinical studies. Victoza\u00ae is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2. The marketing authorisation further includes a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) programme comprised of a Medication Guide to patients and a Communication Plan directed at healthcare providers - both informing about the risk of pancreatitis and the potential risk of MTC. On 26 January 2010 at 08:00 am CET, corresponding to 02:00 am EST, a conference call for investors will be held. Investors will be able to listen in via a link on the investor section of novonordisk.com. Presentation material for the conference call will be made available approximately one hour before on the same page, and a replay of the conference call will be available approximately two hours after its conclusion. Once-daily Victoza\u00ae is the first human Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Victoza\u00ae works by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells only when blood sugar levels are high. Clinical trial data demonstrate a reduction in body weight. Victoza\u00ae is broken down naturally in the body and does not depend upon renal excretion. In Europe, Novo Nordisk received marketing authorisation for Victoza\u00ae on 30 June and Victoza\u00ae has subsequently been launched in the UK, Germany, Denmark, Norway and Ireland. In Japan, Novo Nordisk received marketing authorisation for Victoza\u00ae on 20 January 2010. A regulatory decision is pending in China where a New Drug Application was submitted in August 2009.

Victoza\u00ae er det godkendte varem\u00e6rke i USA og Europa for liraglutid - den f\u00f8rste humane GLP-1-analog (glukagonlignende peptid-1) til dosering \u00e9n gang dagligt, der er udviklet til behandling af type 2-diabetes. I USA er Victoza\u00ae godkendt som supplement til di\u00e6t og motion med det form\u00e5l at forbedre glyk\u00e6misk kontrol hos voksne med type 2-diabetes. Victoza\u00ae kan dermed anvendes som monoterapi, som andetvalgsbehandling og i kombination med almindeligt ordinerede diabetesl\u00e6gemidler i tabletform. \"Den amerikanske godkendelse af Victoza\u00ae er et vigtigt fremskridt i behandlingen af type 2-diabetes og en vigtig milep\u00e6l for Novo Nordisk efter den seneste godkendelse i Japan og den igangv\u00e6rende succesfulde lancering i Europa,\" siger Novo Nordisks administrerende direkt\u00f8r, Lars Rebien S\u00f8rensen. \"Vi er overbevist om, at Victoza\u00ae vil vise sig som en v\u00e6rdifuld behandlings\u00admulighed for mennesker med type 2-diabetes i USA. Victoza\u00ae giver en v\u00e6sentligt forbedret blodsukker\u00adregulering med lav risiko for hypoglyk\u00e6mi og g\u00f8r det dermed muligt for flere patienter med type 2-diabetes at n\u00e5 deres individuelle behandlingsm\u00e5l.\" Novo Nordisk forventer at lancere Victoza\u00ae p\u00e5 det amerikanske marked inden for de kommende uger. Det kliniske fase 3-program for Victoza\u00ae, ogs\u00e5 kaldet LEAD(TM) programmet, der har dannet grundlag for registreringsans\u00f8gningen, best\u00e5r af randomiserede, kontrollerede, dobbeltblindede studier, der har sammenlignet Victoza\u00ae med almindeligt ordinerede behandlinger. Disse multinationale studier vurderede Victoza\u00ae dels som monoterapi og dels i kombination med et eller to diabetes\u00adl\u00e6gemidler i tabletform og viste en bedre eller tilsvarende reduktion af blodglukose i forhold til aktive komparatorer som sulfonylurinstoffer og thiazolidinedioner. Til forskel fra mange andre diabetesl\u00e6gemidler er Victoza\u00ae ikke forbundet med v\u00e6gt\u00f8gning. De kliniske fors\u00f8gsdata fra LEAD(TM) programmet viste, at patienter med type 2-diabetes opn\u00e5ede en v\u00e6gtreduktion. V\u00e6gt var et sekund\u00e6rt effektm\u00e5l i de kliniske udviklingsstudier. De hyppigst rapporterede bivirkninger i det kliniske udviklingsprogram hos patienter, der blev behandlet med Victoza\u00ae, var gastrointestinale forstyrrelser. Gastrointestinale bivirkninger, herunder kvalme, opkastning og diarr\u00e9, blev hyppigst rapporteret tidligt i behandlingsperioden med Victoza\u00ae, og f\u00e5 patienter trak sig ud af programmet som f\u00f8lge af disse bivirkninger. De amerikanske ordinationsoplysninger indeholder en advarsel mod risiko for C-celletumorer i skjoldbruskkirtlen (thyroidea). Der blev i pr\u00e6kliniske fors\u00f8g med Victoza\u00ae konstateret C-celletumorer i skjoldbruskkirtlen hos gnavere. I de kliniske studier var der ingen indberettede tilf\u00e6lde af medull\u00e6rt thyroidea-karcinom (MTC) hos patienter, der blev behandlet med Victoza\u00ae, men relevansen for mennesker af resultaterne af fors\u00f8gene med gnavere har ikke kunnet udelukkes ved kliniske eller ikke-kliniske studier. Victoza\u00ae er kontra\u00adindiceret til patienter med eller familiehistorie for MTC eller multipel endokrin neoplasi type 2. Markedsf\u00f8ringstilladelsen indeholder endvidere en strategi for risikovurdering og -begr\u00e6nsning best\u00e5ende af en brugervejledning til patienter og en kommunikationsplan til sundhedsudbydere - som begge informerer om risikoen for bet\u00e6ndelse i bugspytkirtlen og den potentielle risiko for MTC. Der vil den 26. januar 2010 kl. 8.00 blive afholdt en telekonference for investorer. Der vil blive mulighed for at lytte med via et link under investorsektionen p\u00e5 novonordisk.com, hvor der ogs\u00e5 vil kunne hentes pr\u00e6sentationsmateriale ca. en time f\u00f8r selve konferencen, ligesom en b\u00e5ndet optagelse vil v\u00e6re tilg\u00e6ngelig her ca. to timer efter, at telekonferencen er slut. Victoza\u00ae \u00e9n gang dagligt er den f\u00f8rste humane GLP-1-analog (glukagon\u00adlignende peptid-1), der er udviklet til behandling af type 2-diabetes. Victoza\u00ae virker ved kun at stimulere frigivelsen af insulin fra bugspytkirtlens betaceller, n\u00e5r blodsukkerniveauet bliver for h\u00f8jt. Kliniske fors\u00f8gsdata viser en reduktion i kropsv\u00e6gt. Victoza\u00ae nedbrydes naturligt i kroppen og udskilles ikke via nyrerne. I Europa modtog Novo Nordisk markedsf\u00f8ringstilladelse for Victoza\u00ae den 30. juni 2009, og Victoza\u00ae er efterf\u00f8lgende blevet lanceret i Storbritannien, Tyskland, Danmark, Norge og Irland.
