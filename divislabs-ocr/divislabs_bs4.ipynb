We are currently experiencing some supply chain disruptions during this lockdown period. We  are working relentlessly to minimize disruptions in our production and supply schedules. Even  though the Company has put in place a business continuity plan, due to the restriction in the  movement  of  goods  and  employees,  we  anticipate  certain  delays  in  the  deliveries  of  our  products to our customers.   We remain committed to the health and safety of our employees and their families, as well as  business  continuity  to  safeguard  the  interests  of  all  stakeholders.  All  of  the  precautionary  measures that are taken by the Company will remain in effect until required.   Support to the nation   When our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi called for a 21-day nationwide lockdown to stop  the  social  transmission  of  the  novel  coronavirus,  Divi’s  as  a  responsible  corporate  entity  immediately stepped in to support the health officials and Government leaders as they continue  to work relentlessly to mitigate the spread of the virus.    1                               \f",
