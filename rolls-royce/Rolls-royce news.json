Will Hunt, who works at the Raynesway site in Derby, was selected after excelling in national welding competitions. He is now part of the 39-strong Team UK and will face off against rivals from 80 countries to bring home gold in their field. On hearing the news, Will said: \u201cThe welding competitions have been an excellent opportunity for me to broaden my welding skills and knowledge. It has also been a great experience welding in a competitive environment at the national finals. To be picked to represent the UK on an international stage is something everyone dreams of and I can only thank Rolls-Royce and my colleagues for the support, training and encouragement they have given me to get this far.\u201d","1":"Rolls-Royce has successfully demonstrated \u2018deep magazine\u2019 power capability for directed energy applications, powering multiple, extended laser field tests in collaboration with Lockheed Martin as part of the Layered Laser Defense (LLD) project.   Deep magazine power capability is crucial for directed energy applications, which can be limited by battery-only systems that require recharging or replacement of batteries after a short period of operation. The Rolls-Royce ColdFireTM system includes both battery-powered and near-continuous firing modes, through a compact and fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce M250 gas turbine engine which provides consistent, extended power to operate the laser application. Powered by the Rolls-Royce system, Lockheed Martin\u2019s laser weapon system successfully shot down flying targets during the recent field tests conducted in partnership with the Office of Naval Research at the U.S. Army\u2019s High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Craig McVay, Rolls-Royce Defense, Senior Vice President, said, \u201cThe Rolls-Royce ColdFireTM system successfully demonstrated extended firing capability during the field tests, proving the technology is ready to progress to customer applications. We built the most sophisticated power and thermal management system in the world, so we are ready for any challenge. Our U.S. Department of Defense customers continue to express interest in Rolls-Royce directed energy power and cooling technology, and we look forward to briefing them on the outstanding results from the field tests.\u201d Lockheed Martin developed the 100kW-class LLD to demonstrate cutting-edge laser weapon system technologies in an integrated system. Compact but powerful, and coupled with a Rolls-Royce ColdFire power and thermal system, it provides nearly continuous firing capability to engage more types of targets, in larger numbers, with longer range, than previous systems. Paul Shattuck, Lockheed Martin, Director of Directed Energy Systems, said, \u201cOur industry team worked together in great partnership to bring forward critical knowledge to build this compact laser weapon system with a near-limitless magazine.\u201d Rolls-Royce developed and tested the ColdFireTM system for over 10 years with $50 million in company investment. In addition to providing power to the directed energy system, ColdFireTM offers unique and highly effective cooling technology to dissipate the large amount of heat generated by the laser system. Rolls-Royce is an industry leader in thermal management \u2013 the company\u2019s advanced gas-turbine engines operate at temperatures far greater than the melting point of metal. That requires sophisticated engineering technology that allows engines to operate safely and effectively for thousands of hours. Rolls-Royce has adapted this proven thermal management knowledge into the ColdFireTM system. Rolls-Royce ColdFireTM is a suite of world-class power and thermal options for any directed energy system, with technology ready now and tailored to the needs of the system. With field-proven laser and platform integration, ColdFireTM is suitable for land, sea or air systems, and features thermal and power options for specific customer needs. Directed energy systems offer low cost per shot and reduced logistical burdens, while offering compelling capabilities against today\u2019s stressing threats including counter-hypersonic, and are versatile and scalable. Regardless of power sources or platform, thermal management integration with the laser is critical to system effectiveness. Rolls-Royce North America employs 5,000 people in 27 states and is one of the world's preeminent manufacturers of highly efficient, integrated power and propulsion solutions. Rolls-Royce power systems are used in aerospace, naval marine, energy and off-highway applications. The ColdFireTM technology was developed in the company\u2019s LibertyWorks advanced technology unit based in Indianapolis, Indiana. Rolls-Royce products and services support customers across North America, including the U.S. Department of Defense.","2":"Image \u00a9 Crown      Rolls-Royce Submarines Ltd will launch a new skills academy dedicated to nuclear training, alongside 200 additional nuclear apprenticeships starting in September 2022.

Rolls-Royce North America is growing, modernizing, and leading the way across the U.S.\u201d Phil Burkholder, Rolls-Royce Defense, Executive Vice President \u2013 Defense Global Assembly, Manufacturing & Test, said, \u201cNew testing facilities at our Indianapolis site will further enhance our Indiana advanced manufacturing operations. What we do here provides essential capability for the U.S. military and is also a vital part of the Indiana economy. We appreciate the public officials across federal, state and city governments who continue to support Rolls-Royce in the United States.\u201d  The new Indianapolis test facilities will be built on the company\u2019s Operations Campus near Tibbs Avenue and Raymond Street. The test cells, control rooms and other upgrades will be used to test the modern gas turbine engines manufactured on site, which power a variety of defense and commercial aircraft, ships and power systems in use around the world.  Additionally, Rolls-Royce is investing in test capability in West Lafayette, IN, following on an announcement from 2021 that Rolls-Royce would grow its presence at the Discovery Park District at Purdue. That includes upgrading the company\u2019s electronic engine controls business and adding high-altitude, hybrid electrical and hypersonics test capabilities. The new projects will form a significant, large-scale testing campus at the Discovery Park District, where Rolls-Royce already has an electronic controls facility and conducts advanced engine testing at Purdue\u2019s Zucrow Propulsion Labs.  The five-year test modernization program at the two Indiana sites is in line with the Group\u2019s ongoing investment plans.
