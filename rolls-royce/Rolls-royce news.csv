17 May 2022,Rolls-Royce successfully powers directed energy field tests in U.S.,"Rolls-Royce has successfully demonstrated ‘deep magazine’ power capability for directed energy applications, powering multiple, extended laser field tests in collaboration with Lockheed Martin as part of the Layered Laser Defense (LLD) project.   Deep magazine power capability is crucial for directed energy applications, which can be limited by battery-only systems that require recharging or replacement of batteries after a short period of operation. The Rolls-Royce ColdFireTM system includes both battery-powered and near-continuous firing modes, through a compact and fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce M250 gas turbine engine which provides consistent, extended power to operate the laser application. Powered by the Rolls-Royce system, Lockheed Martin’s laser weapon system successfully shot down flying targets during the recent field tests conducted in partnership with the Office of Naval Research at the U.S. Army’s High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Craig McVay, Rolls-Royce Defense, Senior Vice President, said, “The Rolls-Royce ColdFireTM system successfully demonstrated extended firing capability during the field tests, proving the technology is ready to progress to customer applications. We built the most sophisticated power and thermal management system in the world, so we are ready for any challenge. Our U.S. Department of Defense customers continue to express interest in Rolls-Royce directed energy power and cooling technology, and we look forward to briefing them on the outstanding results from the field tests.” Lockheed Martin developed the 100kW-class LLD to demonstrate cutting-edge laser weapon system technologies in an integrated system. Compact but powerful, and coupled with a Rolls-Royce ColdFire power and thermal system, it provides nearly continuous firing capability to engage more types of targets, in larger numbers, with longer range, than previous systems. Paul Shattuck, Lockheed Martin, Director of Directed Energy Systems, said, “Our industry team worked together in great partnership to bring forward critical knowledge to build this compact laser weapon system with a near-limitless magazine.” Rolls-Royce developed and tested the ColdFireTM system for over 10 years with $50 million in company investment. In addition to providing power to the directed energy system, ColdFireTM offers unique and highly effective cooling technology to dissipate the large amount of heat generated by the laser system. Rolls-Royce is an industry leader in thermal management – the company’s advanced gas-turbine engines operate at temperatures far greater than the melting point of metal. That requires sophisticated engineering technology that allows engines to operate safely and effectively for thousands of hours. Rolls-Royce has adapted this proven thermal management knowledge into the ColdFireTM system. Rolls-Royce ColdFireTM is a suite of world-class power and thermal options for any directed energy system, with technology ready now and tailored to the needs of the system. With field-proven laser and platform integration, ColdFireTM is suitable for land, sea or air systems, and features thermal and power options for specific customer needs. Directed energy systems offer low cost per shot and reduced logistical burdens, while offering compelling capabilities against today’s stressing threats including counter-hypersonic, and are versatile and scalable. Regardless of power sources or platform, thermal management integration with the laser is critical to system effectiveness. Rolls-Royce North America employs 5,000 people in 27 states and is one of the world's preeminent manufacturers of highly efficient, integrated power and propulsion solutions. Rolls-Royce power systems are used in aerospace, naval marine, energy and off-highway applications. The ColdFireTM technology was developed in the company’s LibertyWorks advanced technology unit based in Indianapolis, Indiana. Rolls-Royce products and services support customers across North America, including the U.S. Department of Defense.",https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2022/17-05-2022-rr-successfully-powers-directed-energy-field-tests-in-us.aspx,https://www.rolls-royce.com/~/media/Images/R/Rolls-Royce/content-images/marine/discover/landing-images/pr-default-landing-image-v3.jpg?h=470&iar=0&w=500,Rolls-royce
12 May 2022,Rolls-Royce Holdings plc AGM statement and Trading update,"Rolls-Royce Holdings plc is holding its Annual General Meeting today and is hosting a site visit to its Civil Aerospace business tomorrow. Alongside these events, Rolls-Royce has issued the following trading update for the first four months of 2022 and also medium term outlook for its Civil Aerospace business. In his address to shareholders, Chief Executive Warren East will comment:  “In 2021, we delivered improved financial performance and continued to deliver on our commitments. As a result of the actions we have taken, we have made significant progress on the path to recovery from the impact of COVID-19 and are emerging as a better balanced and more resilient business with a sustainable future, focused on the long-term business opportunities presented by the global energy transition. I would like to thank our colleagues for their commitment and achievements this year and all our stakeholders for their support and engagement. It has been a privilege to lead Rolls-Royce and I am fully committed to driving our business while we work towards a smooth leadership transition this year. We are confident that we have positioned the business to achieve positive profit and cash this year, driven by the benefits of our cost reductions and increased engine flying hours in Civil Aerospace together with a strong performance in Defence and Power Systems, and balanced by our commitment to invest in technology and systems that are critical to the leading sustainable solutions we are delivering now and in the future.”    Trading update and outlook Financial performance year-to-date has been in line with expectation and our financial guidance for 2022 is unchanged. We are well positioned for the anticipated growth in our end markets and continue to expect positive momentum in our financial performance in 2022 despite the ongoing risks around macroeconomic uncertainties. We are working closely with our global supply chain to limit the impact of disruption and will continue to adapt our plans as the global situation evolves. Our long-term sourcing agreements and hedging policies designed to limit volatility in raw material inflation, give some near-term protection and we have increased inventory levels to help mitigate the impact. We are working with our suppliers to monitor and manage these risks and challenges. In Civil Aerospace, large engine long term service agreement (LTSA) flying hours for the first four months of 2022 were 42% higher than the prior year period. Passenger demand is recovering on routes where travel restrictions have been lifted, such as in Europe and the Americas, but additional COVID-19 restrictions have resulted in fewer flights in China where the situation is still evolving. Flying hours in Business Aviation have remained strong. Shop visits and original equipment (OE) deliveries of installed and spare engines are expected to accelerate during the course of the year. We are continuing to capitalise on new opportunities. For instance, Qantas recently committed to a deal for 12 Airbus A350-1000s for its long-haul Project Sunrise initiative, powered by our Trent XWB-97 engines. Rolls-Royce and Qantas have also committed to sign a TotalCare® service agreement for the Trent XWB-97 engines that will power the 12 aircraft.  In Defence, the products and services we provide are delivered and maintained over decades of service to our large number of customers and as such they are not immediately exposed to individual geopolitical events. Our strong order backlog gives us confidence on revenue, profit and cash conversion against the headwinds of inflation and supply chain risk. As guided previously, our operating margin is expected to be lower in 2022 compared with 2021, reflecting original equipment and aftermarket mix changes and the planned increase in investment in Defence to support new programme wins. Governments are increasing their long-term budget allocations towards defence activities, underpinning the long-term growth outlook we hold for Defence.  In Power Systems, the first four months of order intake has been very strong across the entire business and particularly in both power generation and defence end markets. We are working to limit the impact of supply chain disruption, in part through holding increased inventory, which as previously guided will impact cash conversion this year. Interest in sustainable solutions is increasing: the first engines for power generation, construction and industrial applications have been approved for operation with sustainable fuels and we are developing hydrogen engines. Our New Markets businesses, Rolls-Royce Electrical and Rolls-Royce SMR, continue to make good progress supported by Rolls-Royce and third-party investment. We have commenced the multi-year UK Generic Design Assessment process for our SMR design and we are encouraged by the recent commitment to nuclear energy by the UK Government. In Rolls-Royce Electrical, alongside the aircraft manufacturer Tecnam and engine manufacturer Rotax, we have completed the successful flight-testing of a hybrid-electric demonstrator aircraft powered by a parallel-hybrid propulsion system.  We are progressing well with our programme of disposals and are confident in achieving the commitment to generate around £2bn in total proceeds once the sale of ITP Aero completes, which is expected to be in the first half of this year, subject to regulatory approvals. The proceeds from the programme of disposals will be used to repay debt.  Civil Aerospace medium term outlook and site visit We are hosting a site visit at our Civil Aerospace facilities in Derby tomorrow, 13 May. The event will include tours of our facilities and a presentation with Q&A. We will set out our key Civil Aerospace value drivers, highlight the operational side of our business and provide a deeper understanding of how the changes we have implemented are making it a better quality, more resilient, and more agile business which is set up to increase returns and deliver long-term sustainable growth.  The presentation will include our view of the medium-term financial outlook for Civil Aerospace based on the actions we have taken to improve cost efficiency and productivity, combined with the current assumed recovery in demand, which is subject to risks and uncertainties based on prevailing market and macroeconomic conditions. In the medium term, we expect Civil Aerospace underlying revenue to grow at a low double-digit percentage compound average growth rate from 2021 with an operating margin percentage in the high single digits, and with trading cashflow comfortably exceeding operating profit.  Due to physical capacity constraints, the event is by invitation only but there will also be a webcast starting at 10am UK time on 13 May and lasting for approximately two hours. The webcast details and presentation materials will be shared on our website www.rolls-royce.com/investors and a replay will be made available after the event.

5 April 2022,Rolls-Royce launches new mtu NautIQ products with Sea Machines technology to deliver intelligent crew support systems,"Rolls-Royce offers three new mtu NautIQ products with different levels of intelligent crew support, autonomous control, and remote command capabilities  Important contribution to safety, efficiency, and net zero targets  Powered by Sea Machines technology   Rolls-Royce is expanding its range of mtu NautIQ ship automation systems with three new products: mtu NautIQ CoPilot, mtu NautIQ CoOperate and mtu NautIQ CoDirect, which each offer different levels of intelligent crew support, autonomous control, and remote command capabilities. Customers in all marine applications will gain significant operational advantages and benefits in terms of safety, efficiency, environmental impact, and climate friendliness. The new products are the next step in the cooperation between Rolls-Royce and Sea Machines Robotics, the leading developer of autonomous control and remote-vessel command systems, which was first announced at Monaco Yacht Show in September 2021. The continued development of the mtu NautIQ product range is at the core of Rolls-Royce’s strategy to be an innovation leader in the marine business and to provide customers with complete propulsion and control solutions from ‘bridge to propeller’.  mtu NautIQ CoPilot is the most advanced intelligent pilot assist system of the new product range. Depending on operating mode, the human-on-the-loop system can either autonomously control a planned voyage from start to finish, or not intervene at all in human operations, while only guiding the operator. The system enables navigation with greater precision and predictability, helping to reduce costs, fuel consumption and emissions. It is an important step towards more climate-friendly marine operations, made possible by the groundbreaking fusion of digital marine sensors, embedded electronic charts, advanced AI algorithms and one of the world’s most advanced broad-area computer vision systems.  mtu NautIQ CoOperate is an optionally autonomous ship navigation command system which enables off-boat remote command, including all payloads on board. The system can take over routine and monotonous vessel tasks and it allows crews to focus on more important aspects of their missions. The system has recently proven itself in the field in spectacular fashion: The tug Nellie Bly used the system to complete a 1,000 NM roundtrip from Hamburg around Denmark, remotely commanded from an office in Boston, USA, 3,000 NM away. As with all the new products, operators can intervene at any moment if necessary. mtu NautIQ CoDirect is a wireless, remote-helm system that can control a vessel’s engines, steering and transmission as well as payload functions such as winches and cranes from a distance of up to 1,000 metres. This allows marine crews to operate the vessel from the best vantage point, increasing safety and efficiency. For example, a tug operator can leave the wheelhouse to operate the vessel from a location with better visibility.  Michael Johnson, CEO and founder of Sea Machines, said: “This continued partnership is significant because it brings together a foremost marine power and propulsion solutions provider and the leading developer of advanced and AI-based vessel control systems. Our alliance not only increases access to intelligent technologies that can positively impact operators’ bottom lines, productivity, eco-stewardship and safety, but it also provides proof of the growing market demand for these types of systems for real-world operations. We thank Rolls-Royce for their continued trust in our technology and look forward to seeing them in use aboard a variety of vessel types globally.”  Denise Kurtulus, Vice President Global Marine at Rolls-Royce business unit Power Systems, said: “I am excited to see how quickly the teams of Rolls-Royce and Sea Machines have turned our joint vision into products available for our customers. This addition to our mtu NautIQ product portfolio is an important part of our journey towards a provider of integrated sustainable solutions. And it’s a fantastic example of how we, as a company with long history and tradition, implement cutting-edge technology – which benefits our customers and the environment alike – in a very agile way.” Rolls-Royce business unit Power Systems, with its product and solution brand mtu, is pioneering climate-friendly propulsion and power solutions in the marine market. It is currently transforming itself from an engine manufacturer to a provider of integrated sustainable solutions. With the sustainability programme “Net Zero at Power Systems”, Rolls-Royce Power Systems is taking concrete steps towards climate-neutral solutions.

14 February 2022,Rolls-Royce and Porterbrook agreement will drive rail decarbonisation,"Rolls-Royce is teaming up with UK rail rolling stock owner and asset manager Porterbrook, to identify and develop technological innovations to reduce carbon emissions and improve air quality across the rail network. The two companies, who have signed a memorandum of understanding, will investigate the potential for the use of synthetic and net zero fuels, including hydrogen, both in fuel cells and internal combustion engines. Building on their recent success of jointly introducing hybrid battery-diesel railcars into passenger service, the two companies will also explore the potential for advanced hybridisation.  The relationship also includes considering the role of the wider rail ecosystem in decarbonisation, including fuel chain supply, infrastructure and operational models that can aid innovation and the transition to net zero. The UK’s railway accounts for approximately 1% of all domestic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions* and the Government’s ambition is to remove all diesel-only trains – both passenger and freight – from the network by 2040 and achieve a net zero rail network by 2050. The UK Government has identified a number of different routes to this target including alternative forms of power such as hydrogen, fuel cells, batteries, hybrid-electric and sustainable fuels. Warren East, CEO, Rolls-Royce, said: “We have extensive experience of rail technology and are able to draw upon expertise from across our business in new net zero and zero emissions technologies for safety critical applications. We are committed to helping our customers make the transition to net zero by enabling them to use our current and future products in a way that is compatible with emissions reduction, and this relationship with Porterbrook will help us further understand the options for decarbonising rail transport. For us, playing a leading role in enabling the energy transition is both a societal imperative and a very significant commercial opportunity.” Mary Grant, CEO, Porterbrook, said: “We have been at the forefront of developing alternative traction systems for rolling stock over recent years, through our innovations and long-term asset management approach. Our partnership with Rolls-Royce will mean that we continue to lead the UK’s rail sector in sustainable solutions, by leveraging expertise across industries on the pathway to net zero.” Rolls-Royce, through its Power Systems business, has decades of experience in providing drive solutions for rail with its mtu-branded engines in service across five continents. The company has been developing new sustainable solutions including the hybrid-electric mtu Hybrid PowerPack for rail use. This technology recently entered commercial service in the UK with Chiltern Railways on HybridFLEX trains, supplied by Porterbrook, which reduce CO2 emissions by up to 25%. Power Systems is already developing a range of engines for power generation which can run on hydrogen; and is working on fuel cells – that produce electricity – to be used as reliable power supply in ships and heavy-duty off-highway vehicles. Last year, Power Systems committed to release new generations of its most popular diesel engines for use with sustainable fuels by 2023, this includes mtu Series 4000 engines which are today used in locomotives operating in conditions as varied as Siberia and the Australian outback. From next year it plans to have conversion kits available which enable mtu Series 4000 engines to run on 100% hydrogen. Porterbrook owns almost a quarter of the national passenger rail fleet and currently has around 4,000 vehicles on lease or on order. The business has an established reputation for delivering new technologies, such as battery, hybrid and hydrogen powered trains. Alongside the HybridFLEX and other hybrid trains in commercial service, the company has developed HydroFLEX, the first hydrogen-powered train to run on the UK’s mainline network. It can operate under electric, battery and hydrogen power, making it the world’s first ‘tri-mode’ train. Porterbrook was recently named Transport Sector Leader in the annual Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) assessment, where real estate and infrastructure organisations across the world are compared based on their environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance.  *2019 figures.

The partners are proving that existing rail vehicles can be used in a climate-friendly way without the need to install complex and expensive new infrastructure. It is the world’s first regular passenger operation with mtu Hybrid PowerPacks, of which 13 have already been ordered.",https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2022/10-02-2022-world-premiere-mtu-hybrid-powerpack-from-rolls-royce-enters-passenger-service.aspx,https://www.rolls-royce.com/~/media/Images/R/Rolls-Royce/Stories/2022/pr-10-02-2022-landing-image.jpg?h=470&iar=0&w=500,Rolls-royce
10 February 2022,Rolls-Royce announces UK university to join Cyber Technology Research Network,"Rolls-Royce has today announced that they are partnering with Queen’s University in Belfast to address cyber threats.        Rolls-Royce has today announced that they are partnering with Queen’s University in Belfast to address cyber threats.   The Rolls-Royce Cyber Technology Research Network launched in 2020 with the goal of building a collaboration with leading cyber security research universities to help address the growing cyber threats to the systems we produce connect, power and protect society. Queen’s University in Belfast will join two US universities in the network: Purdue University in Indiana and Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania. Bringing a UK facility into the network allows Rolls-Royce to extend the innovative developments already being explored in cyber technology research to an international scale and help to inform cyber security thinking for next generation programmes such as Tempest. Phil Townley, Director Future Programmes, Rolls-Royce Defence said: “Across Rolls-Royce we are committed to staying ahead of emerging threats and our customers rely on us to defend them against those threats and remain cyber-resilient. To achieve this, we must remain vigilant and agile as we evolve our security systems. This research network will help to keep Rolls-Royce at the cutting-edge of product cybersecurity. We have already seen proven benefits from the organisations we have collaborated with in the US, and I am looking forward to extending this network within the UK and utilising the expertise that Queen’s University will offer us.” Professor Máire O’Neill, Director at the Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT) based at Queen’s University, added: “We are delighted to join this prestigious network of cybersecurity scientists working to strengthen Rolls-Royce response to emerging and sophisticated cyber threats. CSIT brings a wealth of expertise to the group which will complement the research projects already underway at Carnegie Mellon University and Purdue University.” The technology research network is expected to conduct two to three Rolls-Royce funded projects with each school per year.  All three schools have research projects underway with nearly half starting at the beginning of this year. In total, there are currently over ten separate projects that cover four broad topic areas. The network will not only benefit Rolls-Royce’s Defence business but will also address the cybersecurity challenges across wider business areas including Civil Aerospace. Alan Newby, Director Aerospace Technology & Future Programmes for Rolls-Royce Civil Aerospace business said: “Customers trust Rolls-Royce to design, produce, and service secure products; both today and in the future as global systems continue to become digitally connected and interdependent. The research we are pursuing as part of this network is group wide and will be applicable and provide cross over benefits to all Rolls-Royce businesses from the newly created Electrical and SMR organisations to Civil Aerospace and Power Systems.”",https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2022/10-02-2022-rr-announces-uk-university-to-join-cyber-technology-research-network.aspx,https://www.rolls-royce.com/~/media/Images/R/Rolls-Royce/content-images/press-releases/linkedin-cyber-security-image.jpg?h=470&iar=0&w=500,Rolls-royce
