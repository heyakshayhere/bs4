"Mar 05, 2020",Allergan Receives FDA Approval for DURYSTA™ (bimatoprost implant) the First and Only Intracameral Biodegradable Sustained-Release Implant to lower Intraocular Pressure in Open-Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension Patients,", /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE: AGN), a leading global pharmaceutical company with more than 70 years of heritage in eye care, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the company's New Drug Application (NDA) for DURYSTA™ (bimatoprost implant) 10 mcg for intracameral administration. With this approval, DURYSTA™ becomes the first intracameral, biodegradable sustained-release implant indicated to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT).  ""Today's FDA approval marks a breakthrough milestone for the glaucoma community and provides a much-needed option for patients challenged with topical drops or needing alternative options,"" said David Nicholson, Chief Research and Development Officer, Allergan. ""At Allergan, our mission is to contribute meaningful strategies that help preserve people's vision, while ensuring that therapies are mindful of the realities of administration and compliance. As a commitment to the ongoing development of this innovation, Allergan has five ongoing Phase 3 studies with DURYSTA™ to support further potential FDA label enhancement and rest of the world approvals.""  The FDA approval is based on results from the two 20-month (including 8-month extended follow up) Phase 3 ARTEMIS studies evaluating 1,122 subjects on the efficacy and safety of DURYSTA™ versus twice daily topical timolol drops, an FDA accepted comparator for registrational clinical trials, in patients with OAG or OHT. In the two Phase 3 ARTEMIS studies, DURYSTA™ reduced IOP by approximately 30 percent from baseline over the 12-week primary efficacy period, meeting the predefined criteria for non-inferiority to the study comparator.  ""Millions of people are living with glaucoma, one of the leading causes of vision loss; however, new treatment options are needed to help doctors and patients better manage this disease,"" said , M.D., Ph.D., Distinguished Professor of Ophthalmology and Vice-Chair for Technology, Director Clinical Research Unit, , . ""The ARTEMIS trials demonstrated that DURYSTA™ lowered IOP in patients by approximately 30 percent and demonstrated a duration of effect through the 12-week primary efficacy period. As the first FDA-approved intracameral, biodegradable sustained-release implant providing continuous drug delivery, DURYSTA™ has the potential to significantly shift the paradigm for treating glaucoma.""  With the launch of DURYSTA™, Allergan proudly expands availability of Allergan EyeCue®, a proven reimbursement service for eye care professionals to facilitate patient benefit verification, savings program enrollment for eligible patients, and prior authorization (PA) assistance for Allergan Eye Care products.  About DURYSTA™    DURYSTA™ is a prostaglandin analog indicated for the reduction of IOP in patients with OAG or OHT.  DURYSTA™ is an ophthalmic drug delivery system for a single intracameral administration of a biodegradable implant containing 10 mcg bimatoprost. DURYSTA™ should not be re-administered to an eye that received a prior DURYSTA™. DURYSTA™ is preloaded into a single-use applicator to facilitate the administration of the biodegradable implant directly into the anterior chamber of the eye.  INDICATIONS AND USAGE    DURYSTA™ (bimatoprost implant) is indicated for the reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT).  IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION    CONTRAINDICATIONS    DURYSTA™ is contraindicated in patients with: active or suspected ocular or periocular infections; corneal endothelial cell dystrophy (e.g., Fuchs' Dystrophy); prior corneal transplantation or endothelial cell transplants (e.g., Descemet's Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty [DSAEK]); absent or ruptured posterior lens capsule, due to the risk of implant migration into the posterior segment; hypersensitivity to bimatoprost or to any other components of the product.  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS    The presence of DURYSTA™ implants has been associated with corneal adverse reactions and increased risk of corneal endothelial cell loss. Administration of DURYSTA™ should be limited to a single implant per eye without retreatment. Caution should be used when prescribing DURYSTA™ in patients with limited corneal endothelial cell reserve.  DURYSTA™ should be used with caution in patients with narrow iridocorneal angles (Shaffer grade ? 3) or anatomical obstruction (e.g., scarring) that may prohibit settling in the inferior angle.  Macular edema, including cystoid macular edema, has been reported during treatment with ophthalmic bimatoprost, including DURYSTA™ intracameral implant. DURYSTA™ should be used with caution in aphakic patients, in pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule, or in patients with known risk factors for macular edema.  Prostaglandin analogs, including DURYSTA™, have been reported to cause intraocular inflammation. DURYSTA™ should be used with caution in patients with active intraocular inflammation (e.g., uveitis) because the inflammation may be exacerbated.  Ophthalmic bimatoprost, including DURYSTA™ intracameral implant, has been reported to cause changes to pigmented tissues, such as increased pigmentation of the iris. Pigmentation of the iris is likely to be permanent. Patients who receive treatment should be informed of the possibility of increased pigmentation. While treatment with DURYSTA™ can be continued in patients who develop noticeably increased iris pigmentation, these patients should be examined regularly.  Intraocular surgical procedures and injections have been associated with endophthalmitis. Proper aseptic technique must always be used with administering DURYSTA™, and patients should be monitored following the administration.  ADVERSE REACTIONS    In controlled studies, the most common ocular adverse reaction reported by 27% of patients was conjunctival hyperemia. Other common adverse reactions reported in 5%?10% of patients were foreign body sensation, eye pain, photophobia, conjunctival hemorrhage, dry eye, eye irritation, intraocular pressure increased, corneal endothelial cell loss, vision blurred, iritis, and headache.  Please see link to full prescribing information  For more information about DURYSTA, visit www.DURYSTAhcp.com  About Glaucoma    Glaucoma is one of the primary causes of irreversible vision loss and blindness. An estimated 70 million people globally are living with glaucoma. This progressive disease is characterized by elevated IOP. Uncontrolled, elevated IOP causes damage to the optic nerve and loss of vision. Reduction of elevated IOP is the only proven way to slow the progression of vision loss associated with glaucoma.  Current treatments to lower IOP include topical medications (eye drops), laser trabeculoplasty, minimally invasive glaucoma surgery and incisional surgery. Eye drop medications are a standard first-line treatment for open-angle glaucoma, the most common form, but low patient adherence to these medications is common – up to 80 percent of patients are not using topical medications as prescribed. Poor adherence to glaucoma medication could result in disease progression and vision loss.  About Allergan Eye Care    As a leader in eye care, Allergan has discovered, developed, and delivered some of the most innovative products in the industry for more than 70 years. Allergan has launched over 125 eye care products and invested billions of dollars in new treatments for the most prevalent eye conditions including glaucoma, ocular surface disease, and retinal diseases such as diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion.

BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic may cause serious side effects that can be life threatening. Get medical help right away if you have any of these problems any time (hours to weeks) after injection of BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic: • Problems swallowing, speaking, or breathing, due to weakening of associated muscles, can be severe and result in loss of life. You are at the highest risk if these problems are pre-existing before injection. Swallowing problems may last for several months • Spread of toxin effects. The effect of botulinum toxin may affect areas away from the injection site and cause serious symptoms including: loss of strength and all-over muscle weakness, double vision, blurred vision and drooping eyelids, hoarseness or change or loss of voice, trouble saying words clearly, loss of bladder control, trouble breathing, and trouble swallowing  There has not been a confirmed serious case of spread of toxin effect away from the injection site when BOTOX® has been used at the recommended dose to treat chronic migraine, severe underarm sweating, blepharospasm, strabismus, or when BOTOX® Cosmetic has been used at the recommended dose to treat frown lines, crow's feet lines, and/or forehead lines.  BOTOX® is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used: • To treat overactive bladder symptoms such as a strong need to urinate with leaking or wetting accidents, a strong need to urinate right away, and urinating often in adults 18 years and older when another type of medicine (anticholinergic) does not work well enough or cannot be taken • To treat leakage of urine (incontinence) in adults 18 years and older with overactive bladder caused by a neurologic disease who still have leakage or cannot tolerate the side effects after trying an anticholinergic medication • To prevent headaches in adults with chronic migraine who have 15 or more days each month with headache lasting 4 or more hours each day in people 18 years or older • To treat increased muscle stiffness in elbow, wrist, finger, thumb, ankle, and toe muscles in people 18 years and older with upper and lower limb spasticity • To treat increased muscle stiffness in children 2 to 17 years of age with upper limb spasticity • To treat increased muscle stiffness in children 2 to 17 years of age with lower limb spasticity, excluding spasticity caused by cerebral palsy • To treat the abnormal head position and neck pain that happens with cervical dystonia (CD) in people 16 years and older • To treat certain types of eye muscle problems (strabismus) or abnormal spasm of the eyelids (blepharospasm) in people 12 years and older  BOTOX® is also injected into the skin to treat the symptoms of severe underarm sweating (severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis) when medicines used on the skin (topical) do not work well enough in people 18 years and older.  BOTOX® Cosmetic is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used to temporarily improve the look of moderate to severe frown lines between the eyebrows, crow's feet lines, and forehead lines in adults.  It is not known whether BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic are safe or effective to prevent headaches in patients with migraine who have 14 or fewer headache days each month (episodic migraine).  It is not known whether BOTOX® is safe or effective to treat increased stiffness in upper limb muscles other than those in the elbow, wrist, fingers, and thumb, or in lower limb muscles other than those in the ankle and toes in people 18 years and older. BOTOX® has not been shown to help people perform task-specific functions with their upper limbs or increase movement in joints that are permanently fixed in position by stiff muscles.  It is not known whether BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic are safe or effective for other types of muscle spasms or for severe sweating anywhere other than your armpits.  It is not known if BOTOX® Cosmetic is safe or effective for use more than 1 time every 3 months.  BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic may cause loss of strength or general muscle weakness, vision problems, or dizziness within hours to weeks of taking BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic. If this happens, do not drive a car, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities.  Do not receive BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic if you: are allergic to any of its ingredients (see Medication Guide for ingredients); had an allergic reaction to any other botulinum toxin product such as Myobloc® (rimabotulinumtoxinB), Dysport® (abobotulinumtoxinA), or Xeomin® (incobotulinumtoxinA); have a skin infection at the planned injection site.  Do not receive BOTOX® for the treatment of urinary incontinence if you: have a urinary tract infection (UTI) or cannot empty your bladder on your own and are not routinely catheterizing. Due to the risk of urinary retention (not being able to empty the bladder), only patients who are willing and able to initiate catheterization post-treatment, if required, should be considered for treatment.  In clinical trials, 36 of the 552 patients had to self-catheterize for urinary retention following treatment with BOTOX® compared to 2 of the 542 treated with placebo. Patients with diabetes mellitus treated with BOTOX® were more likely to develop urinary retention than nondiabetics.  In clinical trials, 30.6% of patients (33/108) who were not using clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) prior to injection, required catheterization for urinary retention following treatment with BOTOX® 200 Units as compared to 6.7% of patients (7/104) treated with placebo. The median duration of post-injection catheterization for these patients treated with BOTOX® 200 Units (n = 33) was 289 days (minimum 1 day to maximum 530 days) as compared to a median duration of 358 days (minimum 2 days to maximum 379 days) for patients receiving placebo (n = 7). Among patients not using CIC at baseline, those with MS were more likely to require CIC post-injection than those with SCI.  The dose of BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic is not the same as, or comparable to, any other botulinum toxin product.  Serious and/or immediate allergic reactions have been reported, including itching, rash, red itchy welts, wheezing, asthma symptoms, or dizziness or feeling faint. Get medical help right away if you experience symptoms; further injection of BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic should be discontinued.  Tell your doctor about all your muscle or nerve conditions such as ALS or disease, myasthenia gravis, or Lambert- syndrome, as you may be at increased risk of serious side effects including difficulty swallowing and difficulty breathing from typical doses of BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic.  Tell your doctor if you have any breathing-related problems. Your doctor may monitor you for breathing problems during treatment with BOTOX® for adult spasticity or for detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition. The risk of developing lung disease in patients with reduced lung function is increased in patients receiving BOTOX®.  Cornea problems have been reported. Cornea (surface of the eye) problems have been reported in some people receiving BOTOX® for their blepharospasm, especially in people with certain nerve disorders. BOTOX® may cause the eyelids to blink less, which could lead to the surface of the eye being exposed to air more than is usual. Tell your doctor if you experience any problems with your eyes while receiving BOTOX®. Your doctor may treat your eyes with drops, ointments, contact lenses, or with an eye patch.  Bleeding behind the eye has been reported. Bleeding behind the eyeball has been reported in some people receiving BOTOX® for their strabismus. Tell your doctor if you notice any new visual problems while receiving BOTOX®.  Bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infections (common colds) have been reported. Bronchitis was reported more frequently in adults receiving BOTOX® for upper limb spasticity. Upper respiratory infections were also reported more frequently in adults with prior breathing related problems with spasticity. In pediatric patients treated with BOTOX® for upper limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infections were reported more frequently. In pediatric patients treated with BOTOX® for lower limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infection was not reported with an incidence greater than placebo.  Autonomic dysreflexia in patients treated for overactive bladder due to neurologic disease. Autonomic dysreflexia associated with intradetrusor injections of BOTOX® could occur in patients treated for detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition and may require prompt medical therapy. In clinical trials, the incidence of autonomic dysreflexia was greater in patients treated with BOTOX® 200 Units compared with placebo (1.5% versus 0.4%, respectively).  Tell your doctor about all your medical conditions, including if you: have or have had bleeding problems; have plans to have surgery; had surgery on your face; weakness of forehead muscles; trouble raising your eyebrows; drooping eyelids; any other abnormal facial change; have symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) and are being treated for urinary incontinence (symptoms of a urinary tract infection may include pain or burning with urination, frequent urination, or fever); have problems emptying your bladder on your own and are being treated for urinary incontinence; are pregnant or plan to become pregnant (it is not known if BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic can harm your unborn baby); are breastfeeding or plan to (it is not known if BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic passes into breast milk).  Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Using BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic with certain other medicines may cause serious side effects. Do not start any new medicines until you have told your doctor that you have received BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic in the past.  Tell your doctor if you have received any other botulinum toxin product in the last 4 months; have received injections of botulinum toxin such as Myobloc®, Dysport®, or Xeomin® in the past (tell your doctor exactly which product you received); have recently received an antibiotic injection; take muscle relaxants; take allergy or cold medicines; take sleep medicine; take aspirin-like products or blood thinners.  Other side effects of BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic include: dry mouth, discomfort or pain at injection site, tiredness, headache, neck pain, eye problems: double vision, blurred vision, decreased eyesight, drooping eyelids, swelling of your eyelids, dry eyes; drooping eyebrows; and upper respiratory tract infection. In people being treated for urinary incontinence other side effects include: urinary tract infection, painful urination, and/or inability to empty your bladder on your own. If you have difficulty fully emptying your bladder after receiving BOTOX®, you may need to use disposable self-catheters to empty your bladder up to a few times each day until your bladder is able to start emptying again.

As an ambassador for the 'My Glaucoma' campaign, Miller will address the misunderstandings and impact of glaucoma and encourage those with the disease, and their caregivers, to take early action. This includes going regularly to the doctor and taking medications as prescribed. Additional information can be found at www.MyGlaucoma.com.  ""Growing up, I had challenges with my vision. I don't have glaucoma, but I know firsthand how it feels to deal with vision issues. Because of this, I'm dedicated to helping others who suffer from visual impairments and their caregivers,"" said . ""Working with , I learned that 27 percent of patients with glaucoma are estimated to go blind in one eye over a 10-year period, and I want to bring attention to the misunderstandings and impact of glaucoma so people and their loved ones can have more informed conversations with their doctors.""  As a child, Miller suffered from vision problems. This made school a challenge for him and he struggled to maintain a positive self-image because of it. Miller finally took control of his vision after a visit to his eye doctor and gained back his confidence that led him to go on to play professional football. Because of this, and knowing firsthand the feeling of losing your sight to any degree, Miller is passionate about helping others take control of their visual impairments and is excited about the opportunity to spotlight the misunderstandings and impact of living with glaucoma by joining 'My Glaucoma' campaign.  ""Following results from a survey of patients with glaucoma, which showed that there are many misperceptions about the disease, we launched the 'My Glaucoma' program in 2019 to amplify and highlight the seriousness of the disease, and encourage people on the frontlines and their caregivers to have meaningful conversations with their doctors,"" said , Vice President, Allergan Interventional Glaucoma.

The video, quiz and other resources for patients living with glaucoma and their caregivers are now live on www.MyGlaucoma.com.  About the 'My Glaucoma' Campaign   The 'My Glaucoma' campaign is designed to help people understand the burden of living with glaucoma and empower those with the disease and their caregivers to feel comfortable speaking with their doctor about a treatment regimen that fits their lifestyle. The resources available on are supported by a new survey of patients living with glaucoma and eye doctors, conducted in collaboration with Glaucoma Research Foundation (GRF), that found more than 75 percent of patients worry about vision loss because of the disease, but nearly half consider glaucoma to be only somewhat or not serious. In fact, research published by the suggests that 27 percent of patients with glaucoma are estimated to go blind in one eye over a 10-year period.  As a leader in eye care, Allergan sought to listen to the voices of patients with glaucoma and eye care professionals to put together meaningful resources that everyone living with glaucoma can benefit from.

About Glaucoma   Glaucoma is one of the primary causes of irreversible vision loss and blindness. An estimated 70 million people globally are living with glaucoma. This progressive disease is characterized by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Uncontrolled, elevated IOP causes damage to the optic nerve and loss of vision. Reduction of elevated IOP is the only proven way to slow the progression of vision loss associated with glaucoma.  Current treatments to lower IOP include topical medications (eye drops), laser trabeculoplasty, minimally invasive glaucoma surgery and incisional surgery. Eye drop medications are the standard first-line treatment for open-angle glaucoma, the most common form, but low patient adherence to these medications is common – up to 80 percent of patients are not using topical medications as prescribed. Poor adherence to glaucoma medication could result in disease progression and vision loss. According to a study published by the , up to 59 percent of patients on treatment for glaucoma continue to progress, meaning they experience vision loss and damage to the optic nerve.
