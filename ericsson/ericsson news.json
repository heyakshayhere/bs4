Little. The report analyzes the power of IoT connectivity to mitigate the complexities brought on by disruptions in the logistics supply chain, including soaring fuel prices, driver shortages, and governmental regulations.\nA competitive landscape, elevated customer expectations, and environmental pressures are just some of the challenges facing the transport and logistics industry. As older trucks are retrofitted and new trucks equipped with fleet telematics \u2014 a technology enabled by cellular IoT connectivity, giving fleet managers and drivers access to data from an array of onboard sensors \u2013 the potential for connected trucks is indisputable. Cellular IoT connections continue to grow exponentially, however, their full capabilities are just scratching the surface. In the transport industry alone, IoT connections are expected to grow from 100 million in 2020 to 292 million in 2030, with connected devices sending more data and augmenting growth beyond the number of connected devices available.\nTwo use cases developed with ZF\u2019s Transics branded Fleet Management Solutions \u2013 an industry leading telematics solution and Orange Belgium are explored in the report that clearly demonstrate the power of IoT-enabled fleet telematics, particularly through truck and trailer monitoring and driver assistance. As we shift the industry into a new gear, the use cases serve as key indicators of the benefits of levering real-time data. In fact, the potential cost savings could be well over 6% for a mid-size truck company\u2019s total cost, with one-third coming from driver assistance and two-thirds from truck and trailer monitoring.\nAlso highlighted in the report is the \u201cAmazon Effect,\u201d which has pushed supply chains to develop and adopt new business models and standards that match Amazon\u2019s logistics capabilities. This includes incorporating fleet telematics, which not only alleviates challenges but can also support turning data into actionable insights. Fleets that have been impacted by the Amazon Effect can include any type of vehicle from planes to micromobility scooters but are especially impactful for the truck transportation industry.\nHjalmar Van Raemdonck, Head of Digital Solutions with ZF\u2019s Commercial Vehicle Solutions division, says: \u201cWe recognize the pressure that many industries are under as they strive to overcome logistics operational challenges, driven by ever more demanding supply chains. Accelerated by the growing requirements and benefits of digitalization, cellular IoT connectivity has become a key enabler for commercial shippers and carriers. Providing real-time operational visibility and supporting asset optimization has an increasingly important role in solving many current and future business challenges.\u201d\nWerner de Laet, Chief Enterprise, Innovation & Wholesale Officer of Orange Belgium, says: \u201cWe have been supporting ZF\u2019s Transics Fleet Management Solutions since 2004, providing global connectivity to help simplify operations for their end customers who frequently drive trucks across borders. With our eSIMS, global roaming connectivity is readily available, enabling ZF to manage long haul trucks for international deliveries.\u201d\nKyle Okamoto, General Manager IoT, Ericsson, says: \u201cImplementation of fleet telematics enabled by cellular IoT connectivity allows enterprises to deploy, manage and scale their IoT businesses in ways never previously possible, from acquisition through disposal. These industries will see an immediate impact as their businesses transform and economize substantially through IoT connectivity.\u201d\n\n\nRelated links\n\n\nConnected Truck Transport report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 16, 2021\n\n\nNetwork automation\n\n\nAutomation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 05, 2022\n\n\neSIM technology by Ericsson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 23, 2022\n\n\nFixed Wireless Access\n\n\nFixed Wireless Access, Networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","1":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne million Ericsson 5G products made at Tczew factory in Poland\n\n\n\nEricsson has produced one million 5G radio products at the Flex Tczew factory in Poland.

We see strong business momentum and our investments in technology and a resilient supply chain have allowed us to continue to win market share and deliver on customer commitments in spite of global supply chain challenges. In the quarter, we saw organic sales[1] growth of 3%. Gross margin at 42.3% (42.8%) indicates underlying stability while absorbing cost increases in the supply chain. Our EBITA margin was 11.0%, adjusted for revaluation of holdings and provision related to Russia. \nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting humanitarian disaster is a major setback for the world. While mobile infrastructure is essential for communications in Russia, it has been clear from the start of the invasion that business in Russia would have to be reconsidered. Following current sanctions, we have announced an indefinite suspension of our affected business in Russia and recorded a provision for impairment of assets and other extraordinary costs of SEK -0.9 b. in Q1. We will continue to monitor and respond to the situation day by day, with priority on the safety and well-being of our people. \nIn our core mobile infrastructure business, we foresee a longer investment cycle compared with previous mobile generations as 5G\u2019s broad application usage will drive a continued need to increase capacity. Technology leadership is driving our competitiveness, and in the quarter, we invested SEK -10.7 (-9.6) b. in R&D.\nNetworks sales[1] grew organically by 4% in Q1 reflecting our continually strengthened market position. Gross margin was 44.7% (46.1%). Software sales vary between quarters, and a certain SEK 1 b. annual software contract that is normally recorded in Q1, is this year delayed into Q2. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by proactive investments in supply chain resilience. Hard work throughout the organization enabled us to deliver on customer commitments despite global supply chain challenges. We also continue to increase our R&D investments to extend our leadership. R&D increased by SEK -1 b. YoY and was primarily related to our Cloud RAN portfolio, which gives customers more flexible deployment options, and to next generation ASICs that provide industry-leading radio performance, energy savings and footprint reduction. We foresee long-term attractive return on our investments similar to the last few years.\nDigital Services organic sales[1] were down by -2% YoY in the quarter and EBIT was SEK -1.4 b. We are building a strong platform for Digital Services and sales development in the cloud native 5G core portfolio is encouraging with double digit growth, albeit from a low base. However, the overall result in the quarter is not satisfactory. The target of a limited loss for 2022 is challenging especially in light of the increased investments in R&D in service orchestration and 5G portfolio. We now increase focus on accelerating sales growth and addressing efficiency to improve profitability.\nTo capture opportunities in the rapidly growing enterprise space, we are focusing on two specific areas. The first focus area is wireless networks for enterprise where we already offer easy-to-use pre-packaged solutions, with Cradlepoint showing strong growth in the first quarter as 5G coverage increases on the US C-band. We also see growing momentum for our 5G portfolio in Dedicated Networks. In addition, we are increasing investments in our enterprise go-to-market organization.\nThe other focus area is a Global Network Platform, which will be built on global unified interfaces, so called APIs. Developers and enterprises will be able to create new use cases and experiences, like high quality video or XR on top of the 5G network, which enable operators and the industry to monetize the network investment in new ways. Ericsson intends to play a major role in building the API platform. With our previously announced intention to acquire Vonage \u2013 more than 1 million developers, 120,000 enterprise customers and a proven scaled API infrastructure \u2013 we will have a strong position to deliver on this ambition.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nEricsson\u2019s IPR licensing revenues in Q1 were affected by several expiring patent license agreements pending renewal and by 5G license negotiations. We are confident in our strong 5G position and leading patent portfolio, positioning us well to conclude pending and future license renewals. Revenues from current IPR licensing contracts are estimated to SEK 1.0\u20131.5 b. in Q2. The actual revenue impact will depend on timing as well as terms and conditions of new agreements.\nWe are currently engaging with the Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding the breach notices it issued relating to the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The resolution of these matters could result in a range of actions by DOJ, and may likely include additional monetary payments, the magnitude of which cannot at this time be reliably estimated. As this process is ongoing, we remain limited in what we can say about the historical events covered in the Iraq investigation and our ongoing engagement on the matter. We are fully committed to co-operating with the DOJ and our work to further strengthen our Ethics and Compliance program, controls and our culture remains a top priority. It was actually our improved compliance program that allowed us to identify the misconduct in Iraq that started at least back in 2011.\nIn light of the global supply chain challenges, we decided to create a buffer of vital components in order to secure that we meet customer delivery commitments. In the quarter this had a material impact on inventory levels and therefore Free cash flow before M&A amounted to -1.7 (+1.6) b. We expect elevated inventory levels to remain in the next few quarters.\nWe are well positioned to continue our strategic journey. The mobile infrastructure business will remain our core and we will not spare any effort to strengthen our position here. Our ambition is to continue to grow and develop this business based on market growth and market share gains. In the growing enterprise space, we are seeing good traction for our established portfolio with Cradlepoint and Dedicated Networks. We continue to work towards closing the Vonage acquisition in the first half of 2022 and to start developing the Global Network Platform. \nWith our investments in both our core and enterprise businesses, as well as in our culture, we are determined to continue to make Ericsson a stronger, more resilient company while at the same time put it on a higher growth trajectory. Our key focus is to accelerate the pace towards reaching our long-term target of an EBITA margin of 15\u201318% and our ambition is to reach this target no later than in 2\u20133 years.\nB\u00f6rje Ekholm\nPresident and CEO\n[1] Sales adjusted for comparable units and currency\nNOTES TO EDITORS\nYou find the complete report with tables in the attached PDF or on\u00a0www.ericsson.com\/investors\nVideo webcast for analysts, investors and journalists\nPresident and CEO B\u00f6rje Ekholm and CFO Carl Mellander will comment on the report and take questions at a video webcast at 9:00 AM CEST (8:00 AM BST London, 3:00 AM EDT New York). \nTo join the webcast, please go to www.ericsson.com\/investors\nTo ask a question, please call:\nSweden: +46 (0)8\u00a0566\u00a0426 51 (Toll-free Sweden: 0200 883 685) \nInternational\/UK: +44\u00a0(0)333\u00a0300 0804 (Toll-free UK: 0800 358 9473)\nUS: +1\u00a0631\u00a0913 1422 (Toll-free US: +1 855 85 70686)\nPIN code: 57370869#\nPlease call in at least 15 minutes before the webcast starts. \nThe webcast will be available on-demand after the event and can be viewed at www.ericsson.com\/investors.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT\nContact person\nPeter Nyquist, Head of Investor Relations\r\nPhone: +46 705 75 29 06\r\nE-mail: peter.nyquist@ericsson.com\nAdditional contacts\nStella Medlicott, Senior Vice President, Marketing and Corporate Relations\r\nPhone: +46 730 95 65 39\r\nE-mail: media.relations@ericsson.com\nInvestors\nLena H\u00e4ggblom, Director, Investor Relations\r\nPhone: +46 72 593 27 78\r\nE-mail:\u00a0 lena.haggblom@ericsson.com\nStefan Jelvin, Director, Investor Relations\r\nPhone: +46 709 86 02 27\r\nE-mail: stefan.jelvin@ericsson.com\nMedia\nKristoffer Edshage, Director Corporate Media\r\nPhone: +46 722 20 44 46\r\nE-mail:\u00a0media.relations@ericsson.com\nCorporate Communications\r\nPhone: +46 10 719 69 92\r\nE-mail:\u00a0media.relations@ericsson.com\nThis is information that Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson is obliged to make public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

The project involves Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) delivered through the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) spectrum.\nThe new partnership, which is part of the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s (FCC) Connect America Fund Phase II (CAF-II), will support IEC\u2019s efforts to improve capacity, coverage, and user experience for its customers. The project deployed in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\u201cIllinois Electric Cooperative is taking a major step towards expanding connectivity and broadband services in areas where they are unavailable,\u201d said Matt Haverfield, Network Operations Manager for Illinois Electric Cooperative. \u201cThe selection of Ericsson, through their partnership with XtremeLTE, allows us to create private networks with superior uplink and downlink performance, and create an infrastructure that is affordable and enables reliable and quality communication services.\u201d\nIEC sought vendors that could comply with the FCC\u2019s challenging Connect America Fund Phase II (CAF-II) Above-Baseline performance tier on a massive scale. After an extensive evaluation process, IEC through Vantage Point Solutions (a third-party independent engineering consultant firm) conducted a field test at XtremeLTE\u2019s facility in Wellsboro, Pennsylvania, whereby the operator successfully demonstrated Ericsson FWA equipment\u2019s capability in delivering a minimum 100 Mbps downlink and 20 Mbps uplink.\n\u201cCAF-II performance requirements are stringent, so a robust evaluation process was in the best interest of IEC\u2019s long-term success,\u201d says Jay Briscoe, Engineering Staff at Vantage Point Solutions. \u201cOur team has enjoyed working with IEC on their FWA deployment in rural Illinois, and this process was an extension of that support. Vantage Point Solutions congratulates Ericsson and XtremeLTE on their selection.\nUnder the new agreement, XtremeLTE will be providing Ericsson Radio System which includes future-proof product lines supporting CBRS, as well as the Educational Broadcast Services (EBS) and Private LTE capabilities that were previously dependent on Wi-Fi technology.\nThe partnership will also bring Ericsson\u2019s AIR 6488 Advanced Antenna System (AAS) solution to more than 50 sites across Illinois. AAS enables state-of-the-art beamforming and Massive MIMO, powerful tools for fostering large-scale deployments in existing and future mobile networks. Through these solutions, IEC will achieve significant performance gains, with the capability to upgrade to 5G New Radio (NR) when needed.\n\u201cCBRS in the 3.5GHz band will have big implications for building private LTE networks and in improving 4G and 5G service offerings,\u201d said Bill Chotiner, Vice President & Chief Technology Officer for Customer Unit Regional Carriers, Ericsson North America. \u201cThis partnership allows us to continue bringing ultra-high-speed broadband to rural communities in America, and it comes at a critical time where service providers like Illinois Electric Cooperative are looking to scale their offerings, launch more use cases and protect existing services.\u201d\nEricsson and the XtremeLTE strategic partnership was first announced in October 2019, and is focused on assisting the Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs) and the fixed wireless industry in obtaining and deploying Ericsson\u2019s carrier-class LTE equipment. XtremeLTE creates a foundation for enabling full, end-to-end broadband deployment, where WISPs or FWA providers will be able to reach more customers with higher speeds, and wide-area coverage and capacity.\nXtremeLTE is proud and excited to support IEC with their CAF II Fixed Wireless network project in rural Illinois. This project aligns perfectly with XtremeLTE\u2019s mission of bringing fast reliable broadband services to rural communities that need immediate access to the Internet. XtremeLTE currently supports over 40 Fixed Wireless Access networks across the USA. Through XtremeLTE, these networks can provide service to their communities in months or even weeks, compared to waiting years for fiber.\nDavid Tews, President of Xtreme LTE commented, \u201cThe combination of Ericsson\u2019s technology and XtremeLTE\u2019s unique ability to deliver quickly from our warehouse in Pennsylvania, has made it possible for us to deploy carrier grade networks in as little as 30 days. This rapid deployment solution helps our rural communities support the demand for high-speed Internet today.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 02, 2022\n\n\nAdvancing digital transformation with ever-present service continuity\n\n\nEdge computing, Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 23, 2022\n\n\n6G and the journey there\n\n\n6G\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 04, 2021\n\n\nOpenness, innovation and flexibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","13":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvitation to media and analyst briefing for Ericsson Q1 2022 report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport to be released at approximately 7:00 AM CEST on April 14, 2022 \nOne live video webcast for analysts, investors and journalists at 9:00 AM CEST \n\n\n\n\n\nPress release\n\n\n\r\nApr 05, 2022 08:00 (GMT +00:00)\r\n                        \n\n\n\n\nAbout Ericsson\r\n                                \u00a0\r\n                            \r\n            #financialreport \n#quarterlyreport \n#Ericsson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEricsson's (NASDAQ: ERIC) financial report for the first quarter 2022 will be published at approximately 7:00 AM CEST on April 14, 2022.\nThe company will issue a press release with the complete financial report attached, including tables, in PDF format. \nFollowing publication of the press release, the financial report will be available on Ericsson's website: www.ericsson.com\/en\/investors\/financial-reports\/interim-reports \nPresident and CEO B\u00f6rje Ekholm and CFO Carl Mellander will comment on the report and take questions at a live video webcast at 9:00 AM CEST (8:00 AM BST London, 3:00 AM EDT New York).\nJoin the webcast or please go to www.ericsson.com\/investors \nTo ask a question, dial:\nSweden: +46 (0)8\u00a0566\u00a0426 51 (Toll-free Sweden: 0200 883 685) \nInternational\/UK: +44\u00a0(0)333\u00a0300 0804 (Toll-free UK: 0800 358 9473)\nUS: +1\u00a0631\u00a0913 1422 (Toll-free US: +1 855 85 70686)\nPIN code: 57370869#\nPlease call in at least 15 minutes before the briefing starts. \nThe webcast will be available on-demand after the event and can be viewed on our website.\nNOTES TO EDITORS:\nFOLLOW US:\nSubscribe to Ericsson press releases here\r\nSubscribe to Ericsson blog posts here\nhttps:\/\/www.twitter.com\/ericsson\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ericsson\nhttps:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/ericsson\nMORE INFORMATION AT:\nEricsson Newsroom\nmedia.relations@ericsson.com\u00a0 (+46 10\u00a0719 69 92)\ninvestor.relations@ericsson.com\u00a0 (+46 10\u00a0719 00 00)\nAbout Ericsson\r\nEricsson enables communications service providers to capture the full value of connectivity.

This type of cooperation with O2 Telef\u00f3nica will enable the company to develop its own applications, as well as build up technical know-how with regard to the operation and use of the 5G network.\nDr. Johann Bizer, Chairman of Dataport's Executive Board and responsible for the Solutions division, explains the goal of the 5G lab: \"Our 5G lab provides Hamburg's public institutions and companies with a development environment in which 5G applications and solutions can be planned, tested and optimized.\"\n\"In Hamburg, we have set up a 5G campus network with our technology partner Ericsson, where Dataport can test the practical application of the for public administration,\" says Karsten Pradel, Director B2B of O2 Telef\u00f3nica. \"I am convinced that Dataport will use the 5G lab to develop many new applications which will benefit the public sector.\"\nBeing the first active 5G SA campus network in Hamburg, Dataport is establishing itself as an innovation driver in the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg (FHH). In this way, the company is making a fundamental contribution to digital public services in a changing digital society.\nPrivate 5G campus network for Dataport's 5G lab\nDataport's 5G lab provides a secure, closed research and development environment where no data leaves Dataport's premises or the administrative IT network connected to the 5G campus network.\nDataport's 5G lab has network coverage both in the enclosed lab premises and in an open area. With this topographical design of the 5G campus network, it is possible to test indoor and outdoor applications under real world conditions.\nIn an initial test, Dataport is testing a 5G connection with a high data rate to the state network (working title: virtual state network connection, vLNA). The test is intended to determine the extent to which 5G technology can be used to provide faster and more cost-effective access to the state network for new or growing public properties (e.g., schools, city halls or public authorities). This is particularly relevant in places where no fiber optic lines are available.\nDataport's 5G lab is also positioned for expansion to other locations: In the future, Dataport could add 5G antennas to interested properties in Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Bremen and Saxony-Anhalt, providing cost-effective 5G network coverage, thanks to O2 Telef\u00f3nica's scalable core network and Dataport's own fiber infrastructure.\n\n\nRelated Links\n\n\nEricsson Private Networks\n\n\nEricsson 5G Standalone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 16, 2021\n\n\nNetwork automation\n\n\nAutomation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 05, 2022\n\n\neSIM technology by Ericsson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 23, 2022\n\n\nFixed Wireless Access\n\n\nFixed Wireless Access, Networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","15":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEricsson\u2019s Annual General Meeting 2022\n\n\n\nAvailable in\nEnglish\nSvenska\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress release\n\n\n\r\nMar 29, 2022 18:07 (GMT +00:00)\r\n                        \n\n\n\n\nAbout Ericsson\r\n                                \u00a0\r\n                            \r\n            #Ericsson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTelefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson\u2019s (NASDAQ:ERIC) Annual General Meeting (AGM) was held on March 29, 2022.

The Ericsson Local Packet Gateway is an all-in-one appliance \u2013 including hardware, Container-as-a-Service (CaaS), software and lifecycle management \u2013 that makes edge applications easy to deploy and manage.\nThe optimized cloud-native user plane and service functions will enable new 5G edge use cases. It has a very compact deployment in a one-server low footprint, with integrated lifecycle management enabling fast time-to-service for new edge use cases.\nThe Ericsson Local Packet Gateway brings dual-mode 5G Core user plane and network slicing to the edge, enabling both mobile broadband and enterprise use cases, from small user plane deployment in a CSP core network, to routing to local applications. Examples of CSP enterprise use cases include sport events applications, virtual reality (VR) gaming and augmented reality (AR) for inspecting factory quality.\nLaurent Leboucher, Orange group CTO & Senior Vice President Orange Innovation Networks \u00a0says: \u201cAt Orange, we continue developing meaningful networks to adapt to the needs and uses all over the world. According to enterprise customers\u2019 needs, a first option is to create a virtual private network on Orange\u2019s public network. A second solution is to create a hybrid private network relying on shared equipment in the Orange network and dedicated equipment at the customer's site for critical flows and data. Ericsson\u2019s 5G Core for standalone, including the Local Packet Gateway help us meet both these enterprise customers\u2019 needs.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\nMonica Zethzon, Head of Solution Area Packet Core, Ericsson, says: \u201cWith the launch of the Ericsson Local Packet Gateway we have taken yet another step in supporting our CSP customers to address the enterprise market, by providing a powerful, slimmed-down user plane that\u2019s easy to deploy at the edge, using an integrated lifecycle management making it easy to scale.\u201d\nCaroline Chappell, Research Director, AnalysysMason, says: \u201cCSPs want flexibility in deploying 5G private networks and delivering network slices and will therefore need a user plane solution that is fast and easy to install and manage on customer premises. Ericsson Local Packet Gateway, with its pre-integrated, appliance-based solution including in-built lifecycle management and a form factor optimized for the enterprise edge, will be familiar from a management perspective and help with time-to-service for new enterprise use cases.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNOTES TO EDITORS:\n\u00a0\nFOLLOW US:\nSubscribe to Ericsson press releases here.\nSubscribe to the Ericsson Blog here.\nhttps:\/\/www.twitter.com\/ericssonhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ericssonhttps:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/ericsson\nMORE INFORMATION AT:Ericsson Newsroom\nmedia.relations@ericsson.com (+46 10\u00a0719 69 92)\ninvestor.relations@ericsson.com (+46 10\u00a0719 00 00)\nAbout EricssonEricsson enables communications service providers to capture the full value of connectivity.

FET is the first CSP in Northeast Asia to enroll in the program, joining a lineup of word-leading operators such as AT&T, Telstra, and Rogers, to name a few. \u00a0\nThrough a curated network of more than 40 startups worldwide, the Ericsson Startup 5G program aims to help CSPs accelerate commercialization and monetization of 5G. The program is driven by the Ericsson ConsumerLab to foster innovation and collaboration across the 5G ecosystem, plugging into a wide range of sectors, including entertainment, education, gaming, sports, and social media. Bolstered by ConsumerLab\u2019s 25 years of research on consumer behavior, insights and trends that impact the ICT industry, the program will also assist CSPs in developing go-to-market strategies while introducing the right partners to enable innovative services. \u00a0\nWith the ambition to maximize value for 5G users, FET has invested heavily in developing new value-added services within its 5G offering, including the recently announced 5G Metaverse Accelerator aiming to deepen the collaboration with local Taiwanese startups. On the other hand, the Ericsson Startup 5G program will allow FET to access a roster of worldwide startups to further amplify 5G use cases to drive substantial 5G uptake.\nChee Ching, President of Far EasTone Telecommunications, says: \u201cWith our solid partnership with Ericsson and leveraging advanced technologies such as Big data, AI, and IoT, we have established the world number one 5G network which offers the best performance and optimal experiences to our users. This lays a great foundation to build more social and immersive experiences utilizing AR and VR technologies that will eventually lead us to realize the Metaverse. I believe the Ericsson Startup 5G program will create a great synergy with the FET Metaverse Accelerator to develop more tangible 5G use cases that will transform people\u2019s lives.\u201d\nJasmeet Sethi, Head of ConsumerLab, Ericsson Research, says: \u201cOur program aims to accelerate 5G innovation to open up a whole new world of advanced digital experiences for consumers in Taiwan. Our partnership with Far EasTone will continue to build on years of knowledge at ConsumerLab on consumer needs and a strong global startup partner ecosystem. We are eagerly looking forward to seeing the future unfold as we work together to define what the 5G powered metaverse can be.\"\nA global 5G consumer study conducted by ConsumerLab, representing opinions equivalent to 1.3 billion consumers and 220 million 5G users, showed that around 70 percent of 5G early adopters are looking for more innovative services. In Taiwan, the number is even higher with 74 percent. \u00a0Consequently, Taiwanese consumers are willing to pay up to 40 percent premium for 5G plans with bundled digital services, compared to a global average of 20-30 percent and just 10 percent for 5G connectivity.\n\u201cBringing FET to the Ericsson Startup 5G program opens a new chapter in our long-term partnership,\u201d said David Chou, President of Ericsson Taiwan. \u201cFET has been a trailblazer in innovating 5G services on top of a superior network with our joint efforts.

The network slice was configured to provide the low latency and high bandwidth experience required for a virtual reality use case.\nThe process from placing an order to creation of the network slice to carry live network traffic took just 30 minutes, demonstrating the ability for CSPs to deliver new services with faster time to market for automated and customized connectivity.\nAndrea Dona, Chief Network Officer, Vodafone UK, says: \u201cNetwork slicing is an incredibly valuable step forward. By segmenting our network, and customising different slices for different requirements, we can bring to life new ideas that would be impossible otherwise. When we configure our network to empower new services, industries like gaming, entertainment and healthcare can enter a new era. What might seem like science fiction is one step closer thanks to network slicing.\u201d\nAndrea Spaccapietra, VP Digital Services, Ericsson UK & Ireland, says: \u201cNetwork slicing will play a crucial role in enabling new and innovative 5G services for consumers and enterprises. With the tools to efficiently manage network resources and provide differentiated services with dedicated performance, leading network operators like Vodafone can enable new business model innovation and use cases across different sectors and unlock new revenue opportunities to realize the full potential of 5G.\u201d\nNetwork slicing is a new service for business customers and application developers, enabled by the deployment of 5G Standalone networks. The service allows CSPs to create multiple virtual network slices which operate across the same physical network. Each slice is isolated from other network traffic to give dedicated performance and eliminate the risk of network congestion, with the features of the slice tailored to the use case requirements.\nBy enabling on-demand 5G connectivity and dedicated performance, consumers and enterprises will be able to access a wider range of services and innovative applications that would otherwise not be possible, such as video-assisted remote operations, AR\/VR, enhanced event experiences, cloud gaming, smart cities, and applications for Industry 4.0 and public safety.\n\u00a0\nNotes to Editor:\nA recent in-depth study by Ericsson and Arthur D. Little - Network Slicing: A go-to-market guide to capture high revenue potential - explores the USD 200 billion value potential of network slicing for CSPs and estimates that 30 percent of the potential future 5G use cases will need network slicing as an enabler.\n\n\nRelated Links\n\n\nEricsson Network Slicing\n\n\nEricsson 5G RAN Slicing\n\n\nNetwork slicing: A USD 200 billion opportunity for CSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMar 15, 2022\n\n\nNetwork slicing\n\n\nNetwork slicing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 22, 2021\r\n|Case\r\n                    \n\nVodafone and Ericsson\n\n\n5G, Cloud native, Core Network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 22, 2022\r\n|Blog post\r\n                    \n\nNetwork experience: Why performance partnerships are crucial\n\n\n5G, AI and machine learning, Managed Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","29":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEricsson, IIT Kanpur & Airtel collaborate with Rajasthan Pollution Control Board to monitor air quality in Jaipur \n\n\n\nEricsson (NASDAQ : ERIC) , Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IIT Kanpur) and Bharti Airtel (\u201cAirtel\u201d), India\u2019s premier communications solutions provider, have collaborated with the Rajasthan Pollution Control Board (RSPCB) to deploy Narrow Band - IoT sensors in Jaipur city to monitor air pollution in real time and raise public awareness.\n\n\n\n\nPress release\n\n\nMar 14, 2022\n\n\n\n\nSustainability\r\n                                \u00a0\r\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe low-cost Narrow Band-IoT based air quality sensors have been installed at 40 key locations in Jaipur.

Building on decades as a sustainability pioneer, the company has made a strong commitment to fulfilling this vision through its own efforts and through working across and beyond the ICT ecosystem.\nThis focus is reflected in Ericsson\u2019s latest Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Report, which highlights its 2021 performance across the areas of responsible business, environmental sustainability and digital inclusion.\n\u201cOur sustainability-driven solutions and partnerships create real impact for our customers and our stakeholders,\u201d says Heather Johnson, Ericsson\u2019s Head of Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility.\u00a0 \u201cBut they also create value for society, whether by enabling the reduction of emissions across industries, creating more energy-efficient networks or helping to bridge the digital divide. We made significant progress towards our sustainability goals in 2021, and we are now setting even more ambitious targets for the future.\u201d\nPerformance and highlights\nNet Zero: In 2021 Ericsson set a long-term ambition to be Net Zero by 2040 across its value chain. To meet this ambition, Ericsson will work towards 1.5\u00b0C aligned climate targets set by the Paris Agreement.\nThe first major milestone is to achieve Net Zero emissions from the company\u2019s own activities by 2030 \u2013 as well as reducing emissions by 50 percent in its portfolio and supply chain also by 2030. \u00a0\nEnergy performance:\u00a0 To meet customer expectations and help the telecom industry reach Net Zero, Ericsson has developed innovative solutions that enable operator networks to use as little energy as possible while managing expected growth in data traffic, meeting the needs of both current and future 5G networks.\nIn 2021, Ericsson achieved 36% energy savings from delivered Ericsson Radio System radios versus the legacy portfolio, surpassing the company\u2019s approved Science Based Target of 35 percent one year ahead of schedule.\nDuring 2021, Ericsson also launched a series of ultra-light Massive MIMO radios that are 10 percent more energy efficient than the previous generation. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDigital inclusion: The digital divide continues to be a key challenge to global economic development with roughly 2.9 billion people still offline. With innovative technologies and services, Ericsson and its partners and customers are pioneering new ways to connect societies and improve lives. In 2021 Ericsson continued its partnership with UNICEF in support of the Giga initiative, helping to map schools and assessing their connectivity in 35 countries by the end of 2023.\nEricsson also made a commitment to positively impact one million children and youth by 2025 by providing access to digital learning and skill development programs as part of the World Economic Forum-aligned EDISON Alliance 1 Billion Lives Challenge.\u00a0\nCorporate responsibility:\u00a0 Ericsson continued its focus on health, safety and well-being in 2021, including a robust COVID-19 response that included a focus on employee mental health and access to vaccines in places where they were not easily accessible. In 2021 there was an increase in work-related fatalities compared to 2020, in contrast to the decreasing trend of recent years.\u00a0 The company has declared this unacceptable and is more committed than ever to Target Zero \u2013 a goal of zero fatalities and lost workday incidents.\nEricsson launched its revised Code of Business Ethics, which defines both the company\u2019s ethical principles and its expectations of responsibility across the value chain. The company also added integrity as one of its four core values as well as publishing a report on the human rights impact of 5G.\nEricsson's Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Report is part of the Company's Annual Report and externally assured by an independent third party. It is also produced in accordance with GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights Reporting Framework.\nGet highlights from the 2021 Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Report here.\n\n\nRELATED LINKS\n\n\nEricsson Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility: Sustainability Report\n\n\nEricsson Annual Report 2021 published.\n\n\nEricsson: Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSep 22, 2021\r\n|Report\r\n                    \n\nEricsson Mobility Report\n\n\nData and analytics, Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 22, 2022\n\n\nCelebrating 10 years of Ericsson Mobility Report\n\n\nData and analytics, Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 15, 2021\r\n|Blog post\r\n                    \n\nA successful automotive ecosystem will be built on connected car data\n\n\n5G, Connected vehicles, IoT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","32":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEricsson Annual Report 2021 published\n\n\n\nAvailable in\nEnglish\nSvenska\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnual Report 2021 available for download and printed version available for order\nThe Annual Report 2021 publication consists of Ericsson\u2019s Financial report 2021, the Corporate Governance Report 2021, the Remuneration Report 2021 and the Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Report 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nPress release\n\n\n\r\nMar 04, 2022 15:30 (GMT +00:00)\r\n                        \n\n\n\n\nAbout Ericsson\r\n                                \u00a0\r\n                            \r\n            #Ericsson \n#annualreport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) Annual Report 2021 is now available to download from the Ericsson web site: www.ericsson.com\/en\/investors\/.

As a proven ICT leader as well as a long-standing partner to IOH, Ericsson is committed to drive society forward through its technologies and solutions. In this 5G rollout extension, Ericsson is powering the network through Radio 6626, a unique three-sector dual-band radio that will help IOH 5G network to increase its Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) 5G frequency capacity.\u00a0\u00a0\nRadio 6626 provides multi-standard and multi-band coverage while lowering costs and reducing footprint \u2013 up to 50 percent lower energy consumption. Through this collaboration, IOH and Ericsson are working together to provide a totally sustainable network within Indonesia by reducing the energy consumption of mobile services without impacting performance.\u00a0\u00a0\nVikram Sinha, President Director and CEO of Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison, said: \u201cThis 5G network expansion is a realization of our commitment to support the Government\u2019s mission to fulfil 5G coverage throughout Indonesia. We believe the 5G network will create a digital ecosystem that supports the needs of the digital economy. Through this strategic partnership, we are extending our commitment to the government to accelerate digital transformation in Indonesia.\u201d\u00a0\nJerry Soper, Head of Ericsson Indonesia, says: \u201cEricsson is delighted to further strengthen its partnership with Indosat Ooredoo by providing 5G services in Jakarta, Bogor, Tangerang, and Bekasi. 5G will play a critical role in accelerating the digitalization of the economy and stimulating next-generation innovation for consumers and enterprises in Indonesia.
