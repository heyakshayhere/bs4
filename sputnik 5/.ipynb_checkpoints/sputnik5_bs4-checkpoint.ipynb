      "(Eds: Disclaimer: The following press release comes to you under an arrangement with PRNewswire. PTI takes no editorial responsibility for the same.) MOSCOW, Nov. 24, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF, Russia's sovereign wealth fund) announces the real-world data of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of San Marino on the Russian Sputnik V vaccine demonstrating it is 80% effective against coronavirus infection from 6th to 8th months after administering the second dose.Efficacy of Sputnik V on 6-8 months is much higher than officially published efficacy of mRNA vaccines. Sputnik team believes that adenoviral vaccines provide for longer efficacy than mRNA vaccines due to longer antibody and T-cell response.The data is based on the number of COVID infections in San Marino in November 2021. Efficacy was calculated based on data obtained from over 18,600 individuals fully vaccinated with Sputnik V not less than 5 months before November.The hospitalization rate with COVID infection following vaccination with Sputnik V in San Marino was only 0.75 per 1,000 people during the entire mass vaccination in the country from February to November 2021. This rate is more than 2 times lower than that of any other vaccine used in the country.Over 70% of the adult population of San Marino have been vaccinated with Sputnik V.An article published in EClinicalMedicine (an open access clinical journal published by The Lancet, one of the world's most respected medical journals) in July demonstrated that the Russian vaccine has a high safety profile in San Marino. In particular, Sputnik V shows high tolerability profile in ≥60 age group with nearly all reported adverse events following immunization being mild or moderate and lasting less than 2 days.Sputnik V pioneered the heterogeneous boosting approach (a \"vaccine cocktail\" using human adenovirus serotype 26 as the first component and human adenovirus serotype 5 as the second component). This approach was proven to be successful in creating a longer and more durable immunity against coronavirus. Sputnik team offered its booster shot (one-shot Sputnik Light vaccine) to other vaccines to lengthen and strengthen their immune response and took the lead in initiating partnerships around the world to conduct joint studies on the combination of Sputnik Light with vaccines of other producers.

      "Buenos Aires, Aug 26 (UNI/Sputnik) Argentine scientists have found that the neutralizing power of antibodies produced after inoculation with Russia's Sputnik V vaccine only increases with time, the country's Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation said.  The researchers analyzed the number of antibodies and their ability to neutralize coronavirus and its variants on 1,800 blood samples from people who had recovered from COVID-19 and those who had never been infected with it. Samples were taken, including 21, 42, 120 and 180 days after vaccination with the Russian medicine.  \"Although there is concern worldwide that the number of antibodies generated after vaccination is decreasing with time, now, for the first time, an Argentine study shows an increase in their neutralizing power against coronavirus depending on when the vaccine was received,\" the ministry said.  \"The Argentine study confirms the increasing efficacy of neutralizing antibodies 6 months after the use of Sputnik V,\" it said.
