      "NON-SENSITIVE   Introduction    As  part  of  its  compliance  program  designed  to  combat  corruption  and  influence  peddling, Naval Group has developed a document repository consisting of a set of  policies, codes and procedures. This repository is applicable to any employee of  Naval  Group  SA  or  any  of  its  controlled  companies,  regardless  of  their  hierarchical level, or any person (sub-contractor, consultant etc.) working at any  of Naval Group's sites in France or abroad. It includes in particular:    -  The  Compliance  code  of  conduct,  which  is  annexed  to  the  internal  regulations of each  Group entity in France. The purpose of this  Code is to  set  out  what  is  expected  of  all  employees  in  order  to  combat  corruption  and influence peddling and, more generally, any form of fraud or unethical  behaviour.   - The Suppliers code of conduct sets out the commitments expected for all  suppliers  and  sub-contractors  regarding,  ethics,  CSR  and  anticorruption  matters.     The  repository  is  applied  operationally  in  the  company's  activities  through  procedures aimed at:   1.  Carrying  out  compliance  due  diligence  in  the  framework  of  contracts  and   agreements concluded between Naval Group and third parties;   2.  Ensuring  that  gifts,  meals  and  other  hospitalities  given  and  received  by  from  or  to  external  stakeholders  are   Naval  Group’s  employees  transparent and abide by the rules defined by the Group;    3.  Defining  a  whistleblowing  hotline  aimed  at  collecting  and  processing  reports relating to behaviours contrary to the ethics and CSR repository;    4.  Defining internal measures and controls regarding the prevention of risks   of conflict of interests;   5.  Defining  the  conditions  of  application  of  a  compliance  program   in   companies in which Naval Group holds participations.   For  foreign  controlled  companies,  these  procedures  are  adapted  to  the  local  context  and  to  the  specific  risks  they  face.  Controls  intended  to  verify  the  correct  application  of  those  procedures  are  operated  by  the  three  lines  of  control  of  the  Group.  Their  results  are  archived  by  the  functions  concerned  in  order to provide feedback intended for updating the group's risk mapping.   © Property of Naval Group SA 2019 – All rights reserved   Head office: 40-42, rue du Docteur Finlay - 75015 Paris  Tel: +33 (0)1 40 59 50 00 – www.naval-group.com  Naval Group - Limited company with a capital of 563,000,000 euros  RCS Paris 441 133 808 - SIRET 441 133 808 00135 - APE 3011 Z   Compliance program-Key procedures | February 2020 |    2                   \f",

A compliance due diligence is updated a minima every 36  months.

Naval  Group  has  experienced  management  teams,  specialised  in  managing  relations  with  these stakeholders.   Compliance  due  diligence  for  these  projects  includes  specific  investigations  (identification  of  natural  persons  ultimate  owners,  managers,  judicial  background  etc.)  in  order  to  identify  and  treat  potential  red  flags.;  If  the  risks  identified  cannot  be  mitigated  properly,  Naval  Group  may  decide  to  stop  the  contractualisation  process  or  the  existing  business  relation  with  the third party. The Group also adds business ethics clauses in its contracts  mentioning  a  right  of  audit  and  a  termination  clause  in  order  to  ensure  compliance  with  anti-corruption  regulations  and  the  application  of  the  best  CSR standards.   Compliance due diligence is embedded in the Group procedures and decision  process, notably:   -  Assessing  and  managing  the  risk  of  corruption  and  influence  peddling  in  the  frame  of  agreements  or  contracts  concluded  between  Naval  Group  and third parties: Naval Group defines different levels of compliance due  diligence and a specific methodology in order to assess the exposure of a  business  project  to  the  risk  of  corruption  and  if  necessary,  to  prevent  them with a mitigation plan.     -  Managing  partnership,  merger  &  acquisition  and  joint  venture  projects:  Enhanced  compliance  due  diligences  are  performed  for  all  operations  relating  to  this  area.

      "NON-SENSITIVE   4.  Defining  internal  measures  and  controls  regarding  the  prevention of risks of conflict of interests.    Naval  Group  prevent  and  addresses  the  risks  of  conflicts  of  interest  (real  or  potential)  and  includes  those  that  may  result  from  relations  with  public  authorities, including Politically Exposed Persons. Among the planned measures:    - The integration of the risk of conflict of interest in the group's corruption  risk mapping. This mapping notably establishes a list of positions identified  as most at risk, updated at least every year.   - The integration into the hiring process of a position identified as at risk of  a due diligence procedure on the candidate verifying the compatibility of his  situation with the responsibilities and the position envisaged.  In the frame  of  this  procedure,  the  candidate  signs  of  a  sworn  statement,  confirming  the absence of any form of real or potential conflict of interest related to  his  new  position,  or  to  commitments  that  he  has  subscribed  to.  He  also  undertakes to inform his manager without delay in the event that he finds  himself  in  a  conflict  of  interest  situation.  These  declarations  are  archived  by the human resources department and can be consulted as necessary by  authorized persons.   If a problematic conflict of interests was identified in the framework of this  due diligence, the hiring process with the candidate may come to an end.   Specific measures are planned for the Naval Group Board of Directors, which has  its own internal regulations dealing, among other things, with  questions relating  to  the  identification  and  treatment  of  the  risks  of  conflicts  of  interest  of  its  members.   5.
