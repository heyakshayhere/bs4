The new technology facilitates the distribution of digitally managed information attributable to individuals (digital identity) between different organizations and services by using an interconnected identity platform.In the trial, a digital student ID issued for the trial via Keio University's Next-Generation Digital Identity Platform(2) was converted by an identity conversion gateway developed by Fujitsu to test the use of different online services linked to an identity platform that uses Fujitsu\u2019s digital identity exchange (\u201cIDentitY eXchange\u201d) technology(3).Fujitsu and the Keio Research Institute at SFC confirmed during the trial that the required information of students could be disclosed to the different services and the information was shared correctly. Put into practical use, this system allows users to link personal information issued by companies, universities, and local governments with various services, delivering a wider range of convenient services linked to students\u2019 digital identities. Possible usage includes offering student discount services for travel agencies or providing job hunting and recruitment support tailored to students\u2019 needs after graduation.\n\nBased on the results of the trials, on April 1, 2022 the Keio Research Institute at SFC and Fujitsu established the \"Trusted Internet Architecture Laboratory\" on Keio University's Shonan Fujisawa Campus as a joint research base for designing architectures and developing technologies for the secure use of Internet services leveraging the new digital identity technology.BackgroundIn recent years, self-sovereign identities, which allow individuals to manage their personal information and provide only the necessary information to service providers, have increasingly attracted attention as a means of reducing the risk of information leakage. Personal information required for online services, including identity verification, qualifications, and personal resumes, is often managed by different individual organizations (local governments for address information, companies for employment information, universities for academic information, and other organizations for professional qualifications) and can prove difficult to utilize and distribute between different organizations and services.Technical standards for digital identities that make it possible to utilize and distribute information between different organizations and services offer the potential to realize greater convenience for a variety of services. Different services require different types of information, however, and the levels of information an individual wants to disclose may vary from service to service. In order to provide users with more convenient services, it is thus necessary to interconnect the multiple identity infrastructures with its various protocols.To address these issues, the Keio Research Institute at SFC and Fujitsu started collaboration on the development of digital identity technology in September 2021. As a result of this collaboration, Fujitsu developed an identity conversion gateway that allows multiple identity infrastructures to be seamlessly interconnected without using a unified protocol.Interconnectedness of digital identitiesOutline of the field trial1.

In this way certificates stored in existing wallets can be leveraged without adding new protocols to the wallet for conversion. The technology further ensures that multiple wallets map to the same person by verifying the identity of each wallet with its certificate.[5]This technology inherits verifiable information by including certificates in the issuer's infrastructure, and issues new certificates that can be verified by the service. This verifiable information allows the identity conversion gateway to detect arbitrary attribute changes as errors.[6]Fujitsu Small Research Laboratory :\nFujitsu researchers will work indefinitely or for extended periods of time in the university, aiming to accelerate joint research, discover new themes, develop human resources, and build medium- to long-term relationships with the university.About FujitsuFujitsu is the leading Japanese information and communication technology (ICT) company offering a full range of technology products, solutions and services.

The two companies will conduct high-speed quantum chemical calculations using HPC and AI technologies to accelerate the selection and optimization of new catalytic materials for sustainable ammonia production.Based on the results of this joint research, the two companies ultimately aim to establish a clean ammonia production method as a basis for power generation and hydrogen energy and to contribute to the discovery of new materials to achieve a carbon-zero future.Background and ChallengesAmmonia offers a potentially promising alternative to fossil fuels and engines that run on ammonia are already available. However, the emission of large amounts of CO2 during industrial processes to produce it remains a major challenge. Ammonia is currently produced on an industrial scale using the Haber-Bosch(1) process, which relies on hydrogen sourced from fossil fuels. Retrofitting the industrial process to use hydrogen sourced from electrolysis of water is possible. However, this is a more energy intensive route and does not fit well with the intermittent nature of renewable sourced electricity (such as solar\/wind) as the Haber-Bosch process requires a continuous source of hydrogen to maintain operation of the downstream processes, which in turn requires uninterrupted source of electricity.In addressing this issue, Atmonia has been conducting research on innovative methods to produce ammonia by only using water, nitrogen from air, and clean electricity. To develop new catalysts that can produce ammonia using protons from water and nitrogen from air, Atmonia aims to further expand and improve the efficiency of its research in catalysts for ammonia production by conducting various tests to simulate chemical reactions using quantum chemical calculations.Outline of the joint researchWithin the joint research, the two companies will leverage HPC technology and AI technology for scientific discovery(2) developed by Fujitsu, as well as simulating data on ammonia production accumulated by Atmonia to conduct high-speed quantum chemistry simulations of a wide range of catalysts. The research will focus on the development of technologies for the discovery of new materials that can reduce the time required for selecting catalytic materials and optimizing surface structures(3).By identifying new catalysts for electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction, the two companies aim to promote a carbon-free next-generation energy carrier that contributes to the goal of realizing carbon neutrality.1.

The two parties will issue environmental value \u201ctokens\u201d(2) based on data on the reduction of CO2 emissions collected through IHI's IoT platform \u201cILIPS\u201d (IHI group Lifecycle Partner System)(3) and establish a platform for distributing these tokens to the environmental value trading market by leveraging Fujitsu\u2019s \u201cConnectionChain\u201d security technology to interconnect various blockchains.Through this new platform, the two companies aim to support an efficient distribution of environmental value and the reduction of CO2 emissions generated by companies around the world, and contribute to the realization of the common global goal of a carbon-neutral society.BackgroundThe trading of environmental values such as carbon credits(4) has been gaining increasing attention as it constitutes a cost-efficient means of reducing CO2 emissions and supports various countries and companies in their efforts to contribute to the realization of a carbon neutral society.At the same time, the expansion of the distribution volume of carbon credits on the market represents an urgent issue in efforts to bolster environmental value trading. Currently, international initiatives including TSVCM(5), a taskforce working to scale voluntary carbon markets, are promoting measures to expand the scale of transactions and standardize trading systems for carbon credits.\n\nPublic and private sectors in Japan are further promoting the use of carbon credits through measures including the \u201cJ-Credit Scheme,\u201d a system in which the Japanese government certifies the amount of CO2 emissions reduced through measures including the promotion of renewable energy and forest management. These measures shall offer individuals and small and medium sized companies new opportunities to create environmental value, digitize the creation and utilization process of environmental value, create a trading market and ultimately expand the supply and demand of environmental value to improve the institutional environment.Current initiatives of the two companiesAs part of its initiatives to go carbon neutral, IHI is utilizing its IoT platform \u201cILIPS\u201d to calculate the amount of CO2 emissions and reductions(6) from operation data of its equipment and facilities. It has additionally started deployment of a digital platform for the visualization and creation of environmental value using blockchain technology in February 2022.Fujitsu is providing its \u201cConnectionChain\u201d blockchain technology to interconnect multiple ecosystems consisting of blockchains and other technologies, that is expected to serve as the basis for environmental value trading. ConnectionChain leverages Hyperledger Cactus, an open source software (OSS) project for secure and reliable integration between multiple blockchain platforms hosted by Hyperledger Foundation. Fujitsu has been contributing to the development efforts for \u201cHyperledger Cactus\u201d(7) since its inception in 2020. Through these efforts, Fujitsu aims to establish a business platform that enables seamless and efficient commercial transactions of a variety of digital assets including environmental values, as well as crypto assets and STOs(8) which are gaining increased attention.Outline of the joint projectWithin this joint project, IHI and Fujitsu will construct a new system that leverages IHI's ILIPS platform to calculate the amount of CO2 emission reductions and Fujitsu\u2019s ConnectionChain blockchain technology to distribute tokens as high-reliable digital assets to the environmental value trading market. In this way, IHI and Fujitsu aim to launch a new platform for the efficient distribution of environmental value on a global scale and will work to expand the market for environmental value trading. At this end, the two companies will promote the application of digital technologies in the process of creating, managing, and trading environmental value tokens, and aim to create a sustainable value chain model in which funds can be reliably delivered to companies that are engaged in environmental contribution initiatives including the use of green energies and measures to reduce their CO2 emissions.Prior to this project, the two companies conducted and completed demonstration trials on linking IHI\u2019s ILIPS platform to Fujitsu ConnectionChain to distribute tokens to the environmental value trading market in the end of March 2022.Market image utilizing the newly developed environmental value distribution platformFuture PlansMoving forward, the two companies aim to realize an environmental value distribution platform by the end of fiscal 2022 and will further promote discussions and demonstration projects with partner companies, related ministries, agencies, and organizations that support this initiative with the goal to contribute to effective and concrete actions toward a carbon neutral society.[1]Environmental value trading :\nMeasurement and certification of the reduction, absorption, or removal of CO2 and other emissions with the goal to create tradeable values based on decarbonization results.[2]Tokens :\nDigitized rights and assets issued independently by companies and organizations using blockchain technology.[3]ILIPS :\nCommon platform for IHI Group products that integrates data on equipment and facilities into cloud servers for use in life cycle business with the aim of enhancing IHI Group products and services.[4]Carbon credit :\nOne representative example of environmental value.

JAXA started operations of the new system at the Tsukuba Space Center (Location: Tsukuba City, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan) on April 1, 2022. JAXA will utilize the new technology to create plans on effective space debris observation, drawing on observation data from radar and optical telescope to calculate the trajectory of space debris and perform comparative analysis with the path of JAXA satellites. In case the system detects space debris approaching satellites, it will support the operators at JAXA in quickly responding to risks and avoid any possible collisions with the space debris by automatically calculating the possibility of a predicted collision and necessary course changes.Moving forward, Fujitsu aims to further improve the accuracy of its analysis system and develop further technologies for application in space to contribute to the safe and sustainable development of space.Figure 1: Overview of the JAXA SSA SystemAn urgent challenge to the future of sustainable development beyond EarthSpace debris like detritus from rocket launches, decommissioned satellites, and fragments of other artificial objects in orbit around the planet from explosions or collisions poses an increasingly severe problem for the future of sustainable development beyond our world. Experts estimate that the number of pieces of debris currently floating in space is more than 100 million, and the number continues to increase. Space debris can move at speeds of more than 7 km\/s around the Earth and is thus powerful enough to cause severe damage to the approximately 12,000 artificial satellites in space. This presents a serious risk to critical infrastructure, with satellites playing an indispensable role in weather forecasts, disaster monitoring, and mapping applications.Fujitsu has been supporting JAXA in its efforts to solve this problem since the early 1990s by creating technology for space debris observation that utilizes orbit determination technology (the predecessor of the current SSA system) that has also been used with the Hayabusa2 asteroid probe and other important projects.In the latest milestone of this effort, Fujitsu has developed a practical analysis system for high precision orbit calculations to accurately track pieces of orbiting debris and forecast their movements to prevent collision with artificial satellites.Figure 2: Space debris imageFigure 3: Trend diagram increasing number of objects in earth orbit(1)About the new systemJAXA\u2019s SSA system consists of a radar, an optical telescope, and a Fujitsu-developed analysis system. The analysis system serves as the core of the SSA system, and allows JAXA\u2019s system operators to create plans on effective space debris observation, the management of acquired observation data, and the analysis of orbit tracking calculations to support the detection of space debris approaching satellites and avoiding collisions. The features of the analysis technology are as follows.Timely identification of collision risks through optimal observation plans and improvement of observation data processing capacity\nTo further improve the SSA system, JAXA's new radar has been designed to also capture smaller objects and to observe about 10,000 objects per day (more than 10 times the number of conventional radars)(2).\n\nIn addition, the analysis system\u2019s processing capacity has been raised by more than 50 times to enable the timely processing of large amounts of observation data and support rapid risk assessment by immediately providing JAXA\u2019s satellite operators with necessary information about the possibility of a predicted collision and necessary course changes to avoid any possible collisions with space debris.Automation of routine tasks and reduction of operational load on system operators\nAs a measure to reduce the operational load on system operators related to the increased number of observation objects and processes, Fujitsu has developed a new function to automatize routine work such as the creation of observation plans and the processing of observation data, which had been mainly performed manually by analysis operators.\n\nThrough the reduction in operational load and the improvement of the efficiency of the analysis system, operators can focus on confirming processing results and responding to emergencies.Interconnection with the SSA system of the Japanese government\nThe new analysis system can be connected to JAXA\u2019s SSA system as well as to the SSA system operated and managed by the Japanese government in order to share observation data. In this way, the new tool enables operators to reply to observation requests from the Japanese government and conduct efficient observations.Future plansLooking forward, Fujitsu will continue to improve the accuracy of its analysis system and contribute to JAXA\u2019s efforts to \u201cmake space visible\u201d.Fujitsu further aims to develop new technologies for aerospace agencies including JAXA to support various applications of satellite data as well as future space exploration and space travel projects and ultimately contribute to the safe and sustainable development of space.[1]Trend diagram increasing number of objects in earth orbit :\nOrbital Debris Quarterly News (March 2022).

The objective of the joint research will be the development of an AI model capable of detecting various types of phone fraud(3), contributing to the prevention of scams that target senior citizens and other vulnerable populations.In Amagasaki City alone, damages from phone fraud in 2021 amounted to approximately 97 million yen (about 830,000 USD). To alleviate this problem and design new tools to combat fraud, from March 30 to March 31, 2022 the three parties will conduct simulations of realistic fraud scenarios in field trials with senior citizens from Amagasaki City, leveraging Fujitsu\u2019s human sensing technology to detect changes in human emotions in tandem with a methodology to measure and scale human emotions developed by Toyo University.Professor Masayuki Kiriu, Department of Social Psychology, Faculty of Sociology, Toyo University comments, \u201cthe field trials will focus on the relationship between perpetrators and victims of phone scams and offer more concrete and effective fraud prevention measures. This project focuses specifically on the emotional and physical changes of victims, which is a field where research has not made much progress to date, with the goal of realizing an AI technology that can intervene to prevent phone fraud. We can call this an unprecedented and empathetic approach to dealing with phone fraud that places special emphasis on the feelings of victims.\u201dBased on data and insights gained during these initial trials, the three parties will conduct further verification trials in the first half of fiscal 2022 to determine the accuracy of Fujitsu\u2019s AI model for phone fraud detection.Innovation through converging technologies to combat a growing social problemAccording to the Japanese National Police Agency, senior citizens aged 65 or older accounted for 88.2% of reported phone fraud cases in Japan in 2021, highlighting the vulnerability of this age group to phone frauds. While special fraud-prevention campaigns to deepen collaboration between anti-crime organizations and the police to strengthen patrols at ATMs, etc., the damage caused by phone fraud in Amagasaki City alone in 2021 amounted to approx. 97 million yen (approx. 831,000 USD) for 102 reported cases that year(4).Amidst the growing number of people over 65 in Japan and many parts of the world this problem represents an increasingly urgent priority. To address this, Fujitsu, Toyo University and Amagasaki City started joint research toward the development of an AI model that detects phone fraud with high accuracy, leveraging technologies that combine Fujitsu\u2019s AI based sensing technology and Toyo University\u2019s research results on psychology and the emotional state of victims of criminal incidents.Overview of the joint researchImage of the joint research1.

Based on the phone fraud scenario created in advance, a phone call with a pre-recorded voice is made to the individual participants to simulate phone calls by a phone fraud group.\n\nFujitsu will leverage its \"Actlyzer\" AI technology for video-based behavioral analysis(5), its AI technology for facial expression recognition to detect changes in human emotions and its AI technology for real time pulse estimation based on facial images to measure and record data (including facial expressions and pulse data) of the participants.\n\nAfter the phone calls, the participants will further reply to a questionnaire to measure their emotional state during the phone calls.Evaluation phase: Analysis of results and development of AI model for detection of phone fraud\nToyo University will analyze the actual data from participants measured during the trials and compare it to individual questionnaire results to identify the relationship between participants' physical and emotional state. Fujitsu will use this analysis to create an AI model to detect possible instances of phone fraud based on characteristics of participants that were (assumed to be) deceived during the simulations. The three parties will conduct a second field trial using this AI model in the first half of fiscal 2022 to confirm its accuracy in detecting phone fraud. Fujitsu aims to develop an AI model that can detect a range of different types of phone scams with high accuracy by the end of FY 2022.3.

In response, many organizations have shifted to hybrid working, as employees grapple with the challenges of collaborating effectively across differences in both time and place. At the same time, with many employees enjoying greater autonomy, some organizations have leveraged the freedoms and flexibility offered by hybrid working models as a way to stand out amidst an increasingly competitive global labor market.\n\nDesigning new ways of working that drive both performance and wellbeing now represents a key concern for organizations looking to attract and retain top talent.Survey Report SummaryHSM Advisory and Fujitsu began a joint study in August 2021 to gain better insight into these themes. In this joint study, Fujitsu and HSM Advisory surveyed how leaders, employees, and organizations are responding to the challenges and opportunities of hybrid work. Adopting a cross-organizational, global approach, we have developed a Sustainable High Performance model to support organizations in the redesign of work.Through this research, we hope to share best practice and insights into redesigning work.Fig. Sustainable High Performance ModelThe research, undertaken in partnership with HSM Advisory from August to November 2021, consisted of interviews with 9 Fujitsu Leaders and 46 Fujitsu employees, and 4 Fujitsu Client leaders. This was followed by a survey, shared broadly through Fujitsu and HSM networks, which gathered data about the experiences of an additional 200 people.

All companies interviewed who had a holistic hybrid cloud strategy \u2014 a group designated as \u201cleaders\u201d by the report\u2019s authors \u2014 agreed they had accelerated their business transformation. This was in stark contrast to just 24% of those classified as followers. The research also found that leaders were more than twice as resilient in coping with workforce challenges during the Covid pandemic.Today, almost all organizations use some cloud-based business applications and realize the benefits of scalability, adaptability, and cost. While a small minority has adopted a \u201ccloud-only\u201d strategy, most gain impact from cloud investment alongside their existing applications and infrastructure \u2013 a so-called \u201chybrid cloud\u201d approach.In terms of behavioral characteristics, hybrid cloud leaders are twice as likely as followers to collaborate with a third-party supplier to help with their hybrid cloud transformation \u2013 according to the survey \u2013 and more than twice as likely to outsource hybrid cloud management. This points to the willingness to leverage the deep expertise of a specialist third-party like Fujitsu in implementing cloud transformation instead of going it alone.The research findings have informed the launch by Fujitsu of its new Cloud Managed Services a holistic suite of cloud management services to help customers accelerate digital transformation, initially for Microsoft Azure, with AWS and VMware services to follow later in 2022.\n\nWho are the hybrid cloud leaders?The researchers identified hybrid cloud leaders based on four key attributes:Leaders align hybrid cloud strategies with their business-wide transformation agendas.\n\n- They are nearly three times more likely to align IT strategies with business transformation agendas, helping create competitive advantage through their hybrid infrastructure.Leaders evolve their hybrid cloud management to facilitate growth and reduce risk.\n\n- Leaders are 60% more confident they can manage security and 75% more confident about managing compliance across their hybrid environment.Leaders empower their talent to maximize value from the next-generation hybrid cloud.\n\n- The leaders\u2019 group is less concerned about the challenges of hiring new talent, with 42% of followers seeing this as a concern against only 27% of leaders.Leaders deploy emerging technologies seamlessly and at scale.\n\n- Leaders are nearly twice as confident they can use their hybrid infrastructure to leverage emerging technologies. Leaders are twice as confident that they can modernize apps and workloads to optimize performance, twice as likely to be able to build apps once and deploy across environments than the followers, and have 50% greater confidence in the scalability of their infrastructure.\n\nShunsuke Takagi, Senior Director, Hybrid IT Global Offering Lead at Fujitsu, comments: \u201cIt\u2019s clear from the research commissioned by Fujitsu that it\u2019s vital to have a holistic hybrid cloud strategy for any organization to achieve digital transformation. It\u2019s also clear that one unmistakable hallmark of a leader is the willingness to outsource hybrid cloud management and work with a third party.That\u2019s why I\u2019m pleased announce the global availability of Fujitsu\u2019s Cloud Managed Services. By providing a holistic suite of cloud management services for Microsoft Azure, AWS and VMware, Fujitsu helps customers accelerate digital transformation.

Fujitsu also provides employees with opportunities for continued growth, such as a group-wide posting program and a system that supports reskilling of its talent. Fujitsu also actively hires on a rolling basis through its new graduate and mid-career recruitment activities.1. Program to transform talent into \u201dbusiness producers\u201dFujitsu implemented a system to support employees with training programs to raise and change their skills and to visualize the skills of its approx. 8,000 sales personnel in Japan, aiming to foster the development of \u201cbusiness producers\u201d responsible for creating new value in cross-industry sectors, rather than filling vertical, industry-specific sales positions.Going forward, business producers, who are in direct contact with customers, will play a central role in accelerating Fujitsu\u2019s transformation into a DX company.2. Assigning the right people to the right positionsIn fiscal 2020, Fujitsu introduced a job-based human resources system for all manager-class people and up and a group-wide job posting system that allows Group employees that are located in Japan to take on new job positions on their own initiative. In fiscal 2021, approximately 2,000 employees that are located in Japan were transferred or relocated through this group-wide system.Fujitsu also supports the diversification of careers by utilizing its expertise and experience in responding to job offers from outside the Group, and also offers a system to support employees seeking career course redirection outside of the Fujitsu Group at their own request.3. Expansion of the temporary \u201cSelf-Produce Support System\u201dAs one of the measures to accelerate the optimal allocation of human resources, Fujitsu expanded the existing \u201cSelf-Produce Support System\u201d(1), a temporary system to support employees seeking career course redirection outside of the Fujitsu Group. By February 28, 2022, 3,031 employees (full-time employees or those re-employed through the post-retirement re-employment system) mainly 50 years of age or older and employed at Fujitsu or Fujitsu Group companies in Japan had applied for this support.4. Financial impact of the above initiativesThe expansion of the temporary \u201cSelf-Produce Support System\u201d is expected to involve a non-recurring expense of 65 billion yen. This expense is recorded in the consolidated financial results for the fiscal year ending March 2022. Accordingly, the full-year consolidated forecast has been revised as follows.*FY 2020 : Gain on transfer of business (+ 25.4 billion yen from mobile phone retail store business) and expenses for business model restructuring (- 6.4 billion yen from restructuring of domestic plants, etc.)*FY 2021 : Expansion of \u201cSelf-Produce Support System\u201d (- 65.0 billion yen)These materials may contain forward-looking statements that are based on management\u2019s current information, views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements.

Leveraging the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer \u201cFugaku,\u201d(1) the new technology enables high-speed calculation of 20,000 variables of data within a single day and allows for the discovery of previously unknown causal relationships relating to drug resistance in cancer cells from 1,000 trillion different possibilities.Fujitsu and TMDU applied this technology to gene expression level(2) data obtained from cancer cell lines in order to analyze drug resistance(3) against anticancer drugs, and succeeded in extracting a new causal mechanism of a previously unknown gene that suggests a cause of resistance to lung cancer drugs. The new technology is expected to contribute to the acceleration of drug discovery and the realization of cancer therapies individualized for each patient.The technology was developed under the theme of \"elucidation of the cause and diversity of cancer using large-scale data analysis and AI technology,\" an initiative supported by TMDU, Kyoto University and Fujitsu as part of the supercomputer Fugaku achievement acceleration program(4).BackgroundEven if a patient receives a targeted cancer drug(5) therapy, the appearance of drug-resistant cancer cells represents an ongoing threat to full remission. The mechanism for how certain cancers become drug resistant remains unclear, however, and researchers continue to work on new methods of analysis that shed light on how cells that have multiple driver mutations(6) acquire drug resistance. In drug development and clinical trials involving drug repositioning(7), it is important to identify patients for whom drugs are anticipated to have an effect. However, the effectiveness of drugs may differ depending on the organ and the individual and variations in gene expression, and the number of patterns combining expression levels of multiple genes exceeds 1,000 trillion(8). A comprehensive search of all 20,000 genes in the human genome would thus take more than 4,000 years with a conventional computer and finding ways to accelerate the process represents a major challenge.Newly developed technologyFujitsu implemented parallel conditional and causal algorithms to maximize computational performance with the supercomputer Fugaku to analyze the human genome within a timeframe needed for practical research. By utilizing Fujitsu\u2019s \u201cWide Learning\u201d(9) AI technology to extract combinations of potential genes relating to the emergence of drug resistance based on statistical information, Fujitsu developed a novel technology that makes it possible to conduct a comprehensive search within a day.ResultsAs a result of running data of the Dependency Map (DepMap)(10) portal using this technology on the supercomputer Fugaku, Fujitsu and TMDU were able to search the entire human genome for conditions and causality within a single day and determine the genes that cause resistance to drugs used to treat lung cancer(11).Comment from Prof. Seiji Ogawa, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto UniversityPromising technologies like Fujitsu\u2019s AI technology for scientific discovery (\u201cWide Learning\u201d) may one day contribute to the discovery of biomarkers, which represent an area of growing interest in drug development. The key to the success of new drug development is to identify patients who are expected to benefit from new drugs and conduct clinical trials. If the marker that predicts who will benefit from the drug is known, the cost of clinical trials can significantly be reduced and the probability of success by conducting individual clinical trials can be increased. From this point of view, pharmaceutical manufacturers and others are expected to be very interested in this technology. The fact that it has been implemented using Fugaku has also raised expectations.Future PlansMoving forward, Fujitsu and TMDU will conduct a multilayered and comprehensive analysis that combines various data including time axis and location data with the aim of accelerating medical research, including in the field of drug efficacy, as well as to shed light on the causes of cancer.\n\nFujitsu and TMDU will also collaborate in experimental research in the fields of drug discovery and medicine. TMDU will further utilize the technology developed in this research to promote research on strategies for intractable diseases such as cancer.\n\nIn addition to medical care, Fujitsu will utilize the new technology to resolve challenges in a variety of fields, including marketing, system operations and manufacturing.AcknowledgementsThis research was conducted as part of Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology's Fugaku Achievement Acceleration Program \u201cUnderstanding the Origin and Diversity of Cancer through Large-scale Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence Technologies\u201d (JPMXP 1020200102).

Fujitsu and TMDU identified conditions under which the expression levels of three transcription factors (genes that control gene transcription (synthesis of RNA)), ZNF516, E2F6, and EMX1, were low. In lung cancer cell lines that meet these conditions, a mechanism triggered by the transcription factors SP7 and PRRX1 was discovered as further potential causes of drug resistance in cancer cells (see reference image).Reference ImageRelated Links\"Fujitsu and Tokyo Medical and Dental University Leverage World\u2019s Fastest Supercomputer to Perform Cancer Gene Network Analysis in Less than a Day\"About FujitsuFujitsu is the leading Japanese information and communication technology (ICT) company offering a full range of technology products, solutions and services.

The exercise aims to identify the most effective ways to use the technology to support local communities in sharing information amongst residents and avoid cases of people being left behind during evacuations.Figure 1 Image of the dedicated app (Japanese and English language version in development)This project represents the latest milestone in an ongoing initiative between the parties. As part of a framework agreement signed between Kawasaki City and Fujitsu in 2014 to promote the creation of sustainable communities(3), the four parties have been engaging in R&D activities as part of the \u201cJoint Project Aiming for Tsunami Disaster Risk Reduction Using ICT in the Kawasaki Coastal Area\u201d since 2017. Verifying the effectiveness of information sharing amongst field trial participants via the app, the parties aim to further promote the practical use of disaster risk mitigation methodologies that leverage the capabilities of AI, high performance computing (HPC), and communications technologies for tsunami flooding forecasts, ultimately contributing to the realization of a safer society.BackgroundRecent years have witnessed the development of several different technologies for real time tsunami flooding forecasts that make use of the capabilities of high-speed supercomputers and AI. Barriers to the practical deployment of such technologies remain, however, including how to share relevant information in an inclusive yet effective manner to the public, taking into account individual differences of users and varying levels of digital literacy.The four parties aim to address some of these challenges by conducting a field trial to test the technology with actual residents of the community in circumstances that replicate the uncertainty of an actual disaster, including the possibility that the AI forecast information itself isn\u2019t 100% certain.Outline of the field trialDate: March 12, 2022 (Saturday) 8: 15 to 11: 15 JST (held at the same time as the comprehensive disaster prevention drills in Kawasaki Ward)Place: Kawasaki Municipal Kawanakajima Junior High School and surrounding area (Kawasaki Ward, Kawasaki City)Participants: local residents and project membersOverview: Field trial to verify the effectiveness of evacuation using AI tsunami flooding forecast data(4)\u2014this data will be delivered to a dedicated app developed by Fujitsu, which residents and organizers will refer to in real time during a simulated evacuation. The field trial will be conducted under the supervision and guidance of Prof. Fumihiko Imamura, Director of the International Research Institute of Disaster Science at Tohoku University and Prof. Takashi Furumura at the Earthquake Research Institute at the University of TokyoSeveral participants briefed in advance of the field trial (including the possibility that AI forecast information isn\u2019t 100% certain) will act as disaster information leaders and receive detailed information including the predicted arrival time and flooding height of the tsunami. Other participants will receive a text message on the app indicating that AI has forecast flooding for their location.When evacuating, disaster information leaders can check the current location of participants in the same community and alert those who are behind in evacuating by using the app\u2019s messaging function.The field trial will be followed by an online disaster prevention course, in which evacuation actions of the participants will be reviewed.Figure 2 Image of community-based evacuation processAbout the appThe app has two display modes. The first one is a detailed mode, in which AI-generated tsunami flooding forecast data is displayed on a map in different colors corresponding to the arrival time and the flooding height of the incoming tsunami.

To address this problem, Fujitsu has developed and implemented training programs for employees globally in the workplace to promote awareness and treatment of headache disorders, as well as prevention programs for employees suffering from such disorders. Fujitsu\u2019s efforts were evaluated by the International Headache Society as a model case of corporate measures to support employees living with headache disorders.As a leader in migraine workplace awareness, education, and employee support programs, Fujitsu will further promote the dissemination of information related to health measures including headache countermeasures not only for employees, but also to their families, customers, and business partners. Fujitsu anticipates that these efforts will encourage greater understanding and continue to provide employees with advanced support for headache disorders and a variety of other related health issues.Figure 1 Accreditation from IHS-GPAC to Fujitsu as \u201cWorld Leader in Migraine Workplace Awareness, Education, and Employee Support Programs\u201dBackgroundIn the workplace, chronic headache disorders tend to be trivialized due to a common lack of understanding. As a result, many employees that suffer from these disorders continue to work while enduring painful headaches and other severe symptoms, leading to a decline in productivity and quality of life (QOL).In June 2018, Fujitsu conducted an in-house survey among Fujitsu employees in cooperation with International Headache Society, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Japan Headache Society. The survey was designed to evaluate the impacts of chronic headache disorders on their work. Of the 2,500 people surveyed, 85% had experienced headache disorders. Of those who experienced headache disorders, 84% had never been treated. In addition, it was found that the economic loss to Fujitsu due to headache disorder-related sick leave and lower performance was approx. 900 USD per year per chronic headache disorder-affected employee. The cost was even higher for those affected by migraine (approx. 2,300 USD). The total cost was approx. 197 million USD per year for all employees, representing approximately 1% of the total annual salary paid to all employees. It was also revealed that health related QOL scores(2) of employees with chronic headache disorders were lower than the national standard for Japan. This demonstrates that headache disorders have a significant impact on daily life and work productivity. To address this issue, Fujitsu launched the \u201cFUJITSU Headache Project\u201d as a headache disorder prevention program that is now globally available to all employees.Figure 2 Estimated economic loss due to absence from work due to chronic headache disorders and decreased performanceOutline of the \u201cFUJITSU Headache Project\u201dBased on the results of a joint study conducted in 2018 (Fujitsu employee survey on the degree of impact of chronic headache disorders on work), Fujitsu in fiscal year 2019 developed the FUJITSU Headache Project in cooperation with IHS-GPAC and the Japanese Headache Society. Utilizing e-Learning programs to help Fujitsu Group employees in Japan acquire correct knowledge about headache disorders, Fujitsu held video seminars for headache patients, online headache consultations with specialists, and headache exercises. Through these initiatives to help employees with headache disorders, Fujitsu attempts to improve QOL and boost work productivity, and aims to create a workplace where people suffering from headache disorders can work comfortably and with peace of mind.1.\u3000Project period: July 2019 to February 2022\n2.\u3000Target: Approximately 70,000 Fujitsu Group employees in Japan\n3.\u3000Content: e-Learning programs and on-demand video seminars, online headache consultations, etc.\nFigure 3 Overview of the FUJITSU Headache ProjectFuture plansBased on the results of the various initiatives of the \"FUJITSU Headache Project,\" Fujitsu, the IHS-GPAC, WHO, and the Japanese Headache Society will analyze and verify the impact of the Fujitsu Headache Project on the improved awareness and understanding of headache disorders among all employees, as well as changes in the burden and work productivity of employees with chronic headache disorders.[1]International Headache Society :\nUK-based charity organization founded in 1981 for people committed to helping people with headaches or facial pain.

By leveraging Fujitsu\u2019s AI and quantum-inspired \u201cDigital Annealer\u201d(2) technologies to optimize computing resources, the newly developed vRAN technology addresses one of the key challenges of conventional vRANs, delivering high-performance with low-energy consumption. Fujitsu estimates that this approach offers the potential to reduce overall system CO2 emissions by 50% or more compared to conventional base station systems by 2025, while offering users high-quality, stable communications.Moving forward, Fujitsu plans to deploy this vRAN technology globally, offering robust and innovative support to telecommunications carriers working to reduce their carbon footprint, and ultimately contribute to the realization of a more sustainable society. Learn more about this at MWC Barcelona 2022 at Fujitsu\u2019s Booth 2G60 from February 28, 2022 to March 3, 2022.https:\/\/www.fujitsu.com\/global\/microsite\/mwc-2022\/BackgroundIn recent years, advances including performance improvements in general-purpose CPUs and the virtualization of wireless signal processing and control technology (telecom function) have opened an exciting wide range of new possibilities for technological innovation in communications, including the appearance of vRAN technology. The introduction of vRANs composed of general-purpose servers, which don\u2019t require the costly development of specialized hardware, is currently drawing attention as an attractive alternative to conventional base stations.Despite their promise, existing vRAN technology continues to face barriers to wider adoption. For instance, vRANs that are not configured with dedicated equipment tend to have lower performance efficiency than conventional base stations. To maintain the same performance, more hardware must be built in, resulting in higher environmental loads in areas like power consumption. In terms of stability and redundancy, there have also been cases in which conventional vRANs cannot sufficiently guarantee carrier-grade communication quality.Features of Fujitsu\u2019s vRANFujitsu\u2019s new vRAN technology supports 5G SA and conforms to O-RAN specifications, while leveraging the following proprietary technologies to successfully solve some of the challenges surrounding conventional vRANs. By optimizing the entire 5G wireless network and reducing the amount of equipment and power consumption, Fujitsu\u2019s vRAN offers the potential to contribute to significant reductions in the total CO2 emissions throughout carriers\u2019 5G wireless systems.1. Fujitsu\u2019s customization approach for high-performance, high-capacity communicationsImproved software control methods for high performance and capacity in communications. Increase communication speed and communication coverage area from two to four times.2. Dynamic resource allocation technologyFujitsu has developed its own dynamic resource allocation technology that reduces excess resources and power consumption by making it possible to flexibly adjust the computing resources of servers needed for operations according to the usage status (traffic volume) of base stations, which varies with region and time of day. By linking the RAN intelligent control unit (RIC)(3), and SMO(4) which orchestrates and manages the entire network, with this technology, mobile phone users' movements and application usage are estimated and optimal resource allocation is achieved.3. Automatic cell re-design technologyIn addition to using AI to predict future traffic fluctuations, this system leverages Fujitsu's quantum-inspired Digital Annealer computing technology to enable optimal allocation of computing resources by rapidly solving problems that are difficult to solve with today's general-purpose computers. By using the superior combinatorial optimization capabilities of the Digital Annealer, it is possible to derive the optimal connection destinations from the various combinations of radio units (RU) and vRANs (Central Unit \/ Distributed Unit) in environments where radio waves from many base stations overlap.CO2 emission reduction of the entire system using this vRANFuture plansIn March 2022, Fujitsu will begin providing software that runs on general-purpose servers for carrier verification, and will support various types of verification, including field testing. By the end of fiscal 2022, Fujitsu plans to start offering this technology as a service on a global basis, with the aim of expanding it to the commercial service networks of each carrier. Its goal is to reduce total CO2 emissions by 50% or more by 2025, compared to conventional base station systems, by successively updating software functions and further improving technologies to reduce environmental impact.[1]virtualized radio access network (vRAN) :\nA virtualized base station created using specialized base station control function-enabling software hosted on a general-purpose server.[2]Digital Annealer :\nFujitsu's domain-specific computer architecture specializes in solving combinatorial optimization problems that are difficult to solve with general-purpose computers because of the huge computational complexity.[3]RAN Intelligent Control Unit (RIC) :\nA RAN control unit that can optimize wireless resource management and automate operations.[4]SMO :\nAn abbreviation for Service Management and Orchestration.

Fujitsu will offer these resources free of charge starting from February 21, 2022 to promote the safe and secure deployment of AI systems in society.The toolkit consists of a variety of case studies and reference materials, including a newly developed method for clarifying ethical requirements in AI ethics guidelines written in natural language, as well as for applying ethical requirements to actual AI systems. The resources in Japanese can be downloaded here, with availability in English to follow in the near future.With this guidance, Fujitsu aims to prevent misunderstandings and potential risks caused by differences in the interpretation of descriptions in guidelines, offering AI system developers and operators new tools for thoroughly identifying and preventing possible ethical issues early in the development process in keeping with international best practices.Dr. Christoph L\u00fctge of the Technical University of Munich, a leading authority in the research of responsible AI and business ethics, comments, \u201cIn Europe, there is a growing debate about AI regulations, and one of the key issues is how to close the gap between principles and practices, or \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow.\u201d I believe that the results of this research are very significant in that they enable us to practice based on principles. I would also like to express my deep appreciation for the decision to open up the research results and stimulate discussion worldwide.\u201dGoing forward, Fujitsu will actively work to partner with government agencies, private companies, and leading researchers to further refine and promote its newly developed methodology and aims to release an expanded version of the resource toolkit in fiscal year 2022.BackgroundIn April 2021, the European Commission issued a draft for a regulatory framework calling for a comprehensive ethical response for AI system developers, users, and stakeholders in response to increasing concerns surrounding algorithmic bias and discriminatory decision-making in AI and machine learning applications.To commit fully to the responsible use of technology and earn society\u2019s trust in AI systems and the companies and organizations involved in this space, Fujitsu has formulated its own AI Commitment in 2019, as well as a new AI Ethics and Governance Office to develop and enforce robust policies for AI ethics, promote organizational AI ethical governance to ensure their effectiveness. Now, Fujitsu will move from principle to practice by steadily implementing best practices in the real-world to ensure the realization of ethical, safe, and transparent AI and machine learning technologies.At present, it is common practice in AI system development to identify possible ethical risks in AI systems based on AI ethics guidelines issued by government authorities and companies. These guidelines are written in natural language, however, contributing to possible differences in interpretation and misunderstandings amongst designers and developers that can lead to inappropriate or insufficient measures. Under this method it is also difficult to judge whether the contents of the guidelines were thoroughly and appropriately reviewed.Many challenges remain, however, and possible misinterpretation of guidelines in the design phase of new technologies can potentially lead to insufficient or inappropriate measures to counter risk.New evaluation method and resources to help clarify guidelines and ethical riskIn preparing this new toolkit and guidance for developers, Fujitsu performed analyses of past AI related incidents collected in the AI Incident Database of the international consortium Partnership on AI (1). This process led to the conclusion that ethical issues related to AI systems can be contextualized with the exchange of information (\u201cinteractions\u201d) between discreet elements within an AI system and between an AI system and its users and other stakeholders.Based on these findings, Fujitsu successfully developed an evaluation method to systematically identify relevant ethical issues related to AI systems, allowing for the creation of AI ethics models (2) that are able to clarify the interpretation of AI ethics guidelines.Fujitsu applied its new evaluation method to 15 representative cases out of the AI Incident Database (164 global cases registered as of February 21, 2022, examples included cases from areas like the financial and human resources sector). Applying the new method, all ethical issues that occurred in real world use cases were successfully identified as risks in advance during verification trials, the results of which have been published.Fujitsu will be offering the following resource toolkit consisting of a variety of resources and guidance for developers to refer to in their own work:Download site (in Japanese, English available at future date)Whitepaper: A general overview of methodologyAI ethical impact assessment procedure manual: AI system diagram, preparation procedure of AI ethical model and explanation of problem correspondence methodAI ethical model: An AI ethical model based on AI ethical guidelines published by the European Commission (created by Fujitsu)\nAI ethics analysis case studies: Results of analysis of major AI ethics issues from the AI Incident Database of Partnership on AI (As of February 21, there were six cases, which were added sequentially.)Use Case: risk in use of AI for the evaluation of individuals for bank loans, recruitmentFigure 1 shows an example of an evaluation process of an individual typical in use case scenarios like personnel recruitment or the approval of bank loans. The correspondence table in the AI ethics model identified the \u201cvalidity of the evaluation process\u201d (whether the evaluation is conducted responsibly with reference to the output results from the AI system) as a check item for the interaction (relationship) between the user of the AI system and the target person to be evaluated, whereas \u201coverdependency on AI results,\u201d \u201cselective interpretation and evaluation of output results\u201d and \u201cignorance of output results\u201d are listed as possible risks.Within this example, AI system developers can identify the risk of an \"overdependence of users on outputs from an AI system that may contain bias and lead to unfair decisions\" as a possible risk in an AI system and appropriately adjust the system to prevent this risk.Figure 1. Outline of AI Ethics Impact Assessment[1]Partnership on AI:\nA non-profit organization established in 2016 that address the ethical challenges of AI, for a future where AI and humans work together.[2]AI ethics models:\nAI ethics models include a correspondence table of \u201ccheck items\u201d and \u201cinteractions\u201d, a tool for step-by-step evaluation of ethical requirements for AI systems. AI ethic models are manually created based on a specific guideline, but once generated, a model can be used generically to evaluate various AI systems. Using this method, developers and operators of AI systems can automatically retrieve all relevant check items from a previously created AI ethics model for a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of related possible risks based on the type of interactions within an AI system.Related LinksFujitsu Formulates \"Fujitsu Group AI Commitment,\" Demonstrating Dedication to Safe and Secure Use of AI (March 13, 2019 press release)Fujitsu Establishes the Fujitsu Group External Advisory Committee on AI Ethics to Ensure the Safe and Secure Deployment of AI in Society (September 30, 2019 press release)Fujitsu Establishes AI Ethics and Governance Office to Ensure the Safe and Secure Deployment of AI and Leading-edge Technologies in Society (January 28, 2022 press release)This is a must for those who are involved in AI!

(Headquarters: Suwon, South Korea, President and Head of Networks Business: Paul (Kyungwhoon) Cheun, referred to as \u201cSamsung\u201d below) and Fujitsu Limited (Headquarters: Minato-ku, Tokyo, Representative Director: Takahito Tokita, referred to as \u201cFujitsu\u201d below) announced that the companies have turned on the world\u2019s first(1) commercial 5G Standalone(2) (referred to as \u201c5G SA\u201d below) Open Radio Access Network (referred to as \u201cOpen RAN\u201d below) site powered by virtualized Radio Access Network (referred to as \u201cvRAN\u201d below) in Kawasaki, Kanagawa on February 18, 2022, successfully completing the transmission of live 5G traffic.For the deployment of this first site, KDDI used O-RAN compliant(3) solutions, including Samsung\u2019s 5G virtualized CU (vCU) and virtualized DU (vDU) as well as Fujitsu\u2019s radio units (MMU: Massive MIMO Units).Virtualization and O-RAN technology replaces dedicated hardware with software elements that can run on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) servers. This brings flexibility and agility to KDDI\u2019s network, allowing the operator to offer enhanced mobile services to its users. Additionally, this architecture will deliver reliability, while accelerating deployment of Open RAN throughout Japan, including in rural areas.Beginning with this site, in 2022, KDDI, along with Samsung and Fujitsu, will deploy this Open RAN in some parts of Japan and continue its deployment and development, embracing openness and virtualization in KDDI\u2019s commercial network.Traditional RAN vs. Open RAN ConfigurationBackground5G technology powers new applications and use cases, such as XR, real-time services in the manufacturing sector (collection of sensor data, remote operation and factory automation) and connected services in the transportation sector (automated vehicles and traffic management). While the number of connected devices and mobile data traffic consumption is exponentially growing, due to the increase in usage, it is more important to build a network infrastructure quickly and cost-effectively.Characteristics of this siteWhile traditional RAN uses hardware-based equipment, this Open RAN site leverages fully-virtualized RAN software, provided by Samsung, that runs on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) servers. Furthermore, by pursuing an open network approach between radio units and baseband unit, KDDI used Samsung\u2019s baseband and Fujitsu\u2019s Massive MIMO Units, which are connected with an open interface.Traditional RAN vs. Open RAN ConfigurationFully-virtualized 5G RAN software can be swiftly deployed using existing hardware infrastructure, which brings greater flexibility in deployment. New 5G SA technologies\u2014such as network slicing, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) and others\u2014powered by 5G vRAN, will deliver superior performance, higher speeds and lower latency, allowing KDDI users to experience a range of new next-generation services and immersive applications.Using an open interface between radio units and baseband unit, Open RAN not only ensures security and reliability but also enables operators to implement best-of-breed solutions from different partners and build an optimal network infrastructure for maximized performance.The virtualized network allows the use of general-purpose hardware (COTS servers) across the country, which will greatly increase deployment efficiencies. Additionally, by leveraging system automation, fully-virtualized RAN software can reduce deployment time, enabling swift nationwide expansion, including rural areas.Comments from Kazuyuki Yoshimura, Chief Technology Officer, KDDI Corporation\u201cTogether with Samsung and Fujitsu, we are excited to successfully develop and turn on the world\u2019s first commercial 5G SA Open RAN site powered by vRAN.

Designed as an integral part of Fujitsu Market Place, and targeted at fashion and speciality retailers, Market Place Self-Checkout serves to re-invent the in-store experience by offering easy, in-store checkout flexibility for shoppers.\n\nSelf-Checkout moves into FashionNow ubiquitous in many countries, around 75% of shoppers say they use self-checkout either all of the time, or some of the time. Self-Checkout has been used for years in the grocery world to create a fast and convenient checkout experience for in-store shoppers. This familiarity, together with the call for less personal interaction and cash-less payments during the pandemic, has pushed retailers to consider moving self-checkout into other store formats.Fashion and Speciality stores, especially those with a high volume of transactions, make them the ideal candidate to introduce Self-Checkout. Compared to cashier tills, Self-Checkout can increase the number of transactions in a smaller footprint in store because each installation requires less space and customers are more inclined to complete a purchase if they do not need to interact with a cashier.Market Place Self-Checkout \u2013 easy, fast and funFujitsu\u2019s Market Place Self-Checkout is designed for fashion and speciality and delivers a fast and easy to use, cashless, self-checkout experience. This puts the shopper in the driving seat and allows them to scan items, check prices, purchase gift cards and pay. Payment can be made by debit, credit and\/or gift cards.It offers retailers the ability to reduce in-store checkout queues, whilst offering a secure and convenient way for shoppers to quickly checkout - avoiding till checkout queues, but still with the benefit of getting their purchases immediately \u2013 providing the speed and convenience of online shopping - without the wait for delivery.A clear and easy to follow user interface guides the shopper through the purchasing process with a simple scan, pay, bag, pick-up receipt and leave approach. When a shopper needs assistance, Market Place Self-Checkout offers the option to use lane lights to guide the shoppers to an available self-checkout and to notify SCO support teams, or to notify via digital alerts to smart phones or smart watches.Rowan Cape, Head of Global Retail Software Solutions at Fujitsu comments \u2018Fujitsu is excited for Market Place Self-Checkout to go live and re-invent the in-store experience for fashion and speciality shoppers. Customers love self-checkout, no-one likes to wait in long checkout queues and everyone likes to be in control of when and how they checkout. Market Place Self-Checkout brings that choice in a fun experience to fashion stores. We believe it will revolutionize how quickly shoppers can shop and pay, help to significantly reduce till checkout queues, and, on the back of a great visit, will encourage shoppers to return for more.\u2019\n\nMarket Place Self-Checkout \u2013 hybrid till or self-service \u2013 you chooseMarket Place Self-Checkout can be deployed either as dedicated Self-Checkout lanes, or hybrid till and self-checkout lanes, allowing SCO devices to be converted to a regular cashier till lane in seconds when in-store conditions change. It runs on the same retail hardware as other payment points in-store, making Market Place Self-Checkout simple to deploy and support.By moving checkout into the hands of the shoppers, and using only one staff member to support 4-5 SCO checkouts, Market Place Self-Checkout can also help to alleviate the pressure of constantly recruiting staff caused by high turnover.Fujitsu Market Place - customer experience orchestrationTo run a truly customer-centric business, retailers need the freedom to deliver the customer experience their shoppers want. Fujitsu Market Place is a global, digital commerce solution designed to create unique customer experiences, enabled by omnichannel retail orchestration across multiple customer touchpoints. It provides a flexible and secure checkout shopping experience, regardless of device, plus the capability to view inventory across stores and online, place and process orders anywhere, and manage store-to-store transfers, pick-ups and home deliveries. In addition to self-checkout, Market Place offers speciality and fashion retailers digital store commerce features such as self-service Scan & Pay, downloadable to a shopper\u2019s own device, Associate Mobile and in-store Caf\u00e9 and Concessions functionality designed to turn the in-store experience into a delight.\n\nOnline resourcesRead about Fujitsu Retail Technology and Hospitality IT Solutions: https:\/\/www.fujitsu.com\/global\/solutions\/industry\/retail\/Read the Fujitsu blog: http:\/\/blog.ts.fujitsu.comFollow Fujitsu on Twitter: http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/Fujitsu_GlobalFollow us on LinkedIn: http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/fujitsuFind Fujitsu on Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/FujitsuICTFujitsu pictures and media server: http:\/\/mediaportal.ts.fujitsu.com\/pages\/portal.phpFor regular news updates, bookmark the Fujitsu newsroom: https:\/\/www.fujitsu.com\/emeia\/about\/resources\/news\/newsroom.html\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Fujitsu\r\n\r\n\r\nFujitsu is the leading Japanese information and communication technology (ICT) company offering a full range of technology products, solutions and services.

NTT DOCOMO, INC. (hereinafter NTT DOCOMO) has provided Fujitsu with technical support throughout the project. With the construction of this new test facility, KT will accelerate the introduction of Open RAN technology to Korea\u2019s 5G network.As a result of their successful collaboration, the three companies have concluded a Memorandum of Understanding (effective date January 6, 2022), centering on the introduction of software-defined virtualized RAN (hereinafter vRAN) and RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) (2) in alignment with the \u201c5G Open RAN Ecosystem\u201d (3), an initiative whose participants include NTT DOCOMO and Fujitsu. In this Memorandum of Understanding, the three companies agree to cooperate towards further activities including the construction of an O-RAN test facility and multi-vendor interoperability testing in Korea.In addition to these activities, the three companies will continue to create market-leading innovations and target the global expansion of Open RAN.The multi-vendor RAN architecture enables optimum solutions for a variety of deployment scenarios, including small, space-saving base stations that can cover areas in city centers where communication is concentrated, or base stations that can cover wide areas and can thus contribute to efficient and flexible equipment procurement and cost reductions. Open specifications also make it possible to create safe and transparent RAN architecture.5G mobile networks are becoming increasingly popular in Korea, and the demand for 5G is expected to grow even further in the future. KT is considering the introduction of multi-vendor Open RAN to reduce equipment procurement and construction costs and to achieve flexible network construction capabilities. To this end, KT and Fujitsu constructed an Open RAN verification facility and conducted testing for multi-vendor interoperability with O-RAN open fronthaul in October 2021. For the testing facility, KT has adopted Fujitsu\u2019s 5G base stations, which were the world\u2019s first O-RAN compliant (4) base stations adopted for commercial service by NTT DOCOMO. The tests involved verification of the interoperability between the base station controllers (CU: Central Unit\/DU: Distributed Unit) of Fujitsu's 5G base station equipment and a Korean medium-sized vendor\u2019s radio unit, as well as end-to-end communication tests. The companies successfully verified O-RAN compliant operation during the tests.\n\nFujitsu supplied KT with 5G base station equipment and provided support during the verification tests, while Fujitsu in turn received NTT DOCOMO's technical support for multi-vendor interoperability testing.Moving forward, KT aims to further expand its verification facilities with an eye toward the future introduction of Open RAN based vRAN and RIC systems.The three companies plan to further strengthen their collaboration as part of the \u201c5G Open RAN Ecosystem\u201d initiative.[1]Open fronthaul:\nO-RAN standardized interface that connects CU\/DU and RU.[2]RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC):\nRAN Controller able to optimize the management of radio resources and automize operations.[3]5G Open RAN Ecosystem:\nActivity by NTT DOCOMO, Fujitsu and partner companies with the objective to globally accelerate open radio access networks (open RAN), and help enable flexible network deployment to serve diverse company and operator needs in the 5G era, including vRAN commercialization.[4]O-RAN compliant:\nCompliance with common specification developed by the O-RAN ALLIANCE (Open Radio Access Network ALLIANCE), an industry group that promotes standardization with the aim of realizing a next-generation radio access network that is open and extensible.

The results of the research collaboration between Fujitsu and CBMM are published in a paper discussing computational principles that draw inspiration from neuroscience to enable AI models to recognize unseen (out-of-distribution, OOD) data (1) that deviates from the original training data. Highlights of the paper will be presented at the NeurIPS 2021 (Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems) (2), showing improvements in the accuracy of AI models.The advent of deep neural networks (DNNs) in recent years has contributed to an increasing variety of real-world applications for AI and machine learning technologies, including for tasks like defect detection for the manufacturing industry and diagnostic imaging in the medical field. While these AI models can at times demonstrate performance equal to or better than that of humans, challenges remain as recognition accuracy tends to deteriorate when environmental conditions like lighting and perspective significantly differ from those in datasets used during the training process.To resolve this, researchers at Fujitsu and CBMM have made collaborative progress in understanding AI principles enabling recognition of OOD data with high accuracy by dividing the DNN into modules - for example shape and color, amongst other attributes - taking a unique approach inspired by the cognitive characteristics of humans and the structure of the brain. An AI model using this process was rated as the most accurate in an evaluation measuring image recognition accuracy against the \u201cCLEVR-CoGenT\u201d benchmark (3), as shown in the paper presented by the group at NeurIPS.Dr. Seishi Okamoto, Fellow at Fujitsu Limited commented \u201cSince 2019, Fujitsu has engaged in joint research with MIT\u2019s CBMM to deepen our understanding of how the human brain synthesizes information to generate intelligent behavior, pursuing how to realize such intelligence as AI and leveraging this knowledge that contributes to solving problems facing a variety of industries and society at large. This achievement marks a major milestone for the future development of AI technology that could deliver a new tool for training models that can respond flexibly to different situations and recognize even unknown data that differs considerably from the original training data with high accuracy, and we look forward to the exciting real-world possibilities this opens up.\u201dDr. Tomaso Poggio, the Eugene McDermott Professor at the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT and Director of the Center for Brains, Minds and Machines, remarked, \u201cThere is a significant gap between DNNs and humans when evaluated in out-of-distribution conditions, which severely compromises AI applications, especially in terms of their safety and fairness. Research inspired by neuroscience may lead to novel technologies capable of overcoming dataset bias. The results obtained so far in this research program are a good step in this direction.\u201dFuture possible applications may include AI for monitoring traffic that can respond to changes in various observation conditions and a diagnostic medical imaging AI that can correctly recognize different types of lesions.About the New MethodResearch findings focus on the fact that the human brain can precisely capture and classify visual information, even if there are differences in shapes and colors of the objects we perceive. The new method calculates a unique index based on the way an object is perceived by neurons and how the DNN classifies the input images. The model encourages the increase of the index in order to improve recognizing OOD example objects more effectively.Up to now it was assumed that the best method to create an AI model with high recognition accuracy was to train the DNN as a single module without splitting it up. However, by splitting the DNN into separate modules depending on shapes, colors, and other attributes of the objects based on the newly developed index, researchers at Fujitsu and CBMM have successfully achieved higher recognition accuracy.Image: Principles that enable AI to achieve high recognition accuracy of OOD data by utilizing an original index indicating the degree of image recognition of AIFuture PlansFujitsu and CBMM hope to further refine the findings to develop an AI able to make human-like flexible judgments with the aim to apply it in various areas like manufacturing and medical care.[1]OOD data:\nData substantially different from the data seen during the AI training.[2]Presented at NeurIPS:\n\"How Modular Should Neural Module Networks Be for Systematic Generalization?\"; Planned presentation date and time: December 8, 4:30 PM PST\/ December 9, 2021 9:30 AM JST\n\nPresenters: Vanessa D'Amario (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Tomotake Sasaki (Fujitsu) and Xavier Boix (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) https:\/\/neurips.cc\/Conferences\/2021\/Schedule?showEvent=26740[3]CLEVR-CoGenT dataset:\nA benchmark developed by Stanford University to measure an AI's ability to recognize new combinations of objects and attributes.\nhttps:\/\/cs.stanford.edu\/people\/jcjohns\/clevr\/About FujitsuFujitsu is the leading Japanese information and communication technology (ICT) company offering a full range of technology products, solutions and services.

In a major step toward solving this global problem, the Hamburg Port Authority (HPA) has successfully demonstrated an approach to the more sustainable transportation of goods. The solution hinges on applying Fujitsu\u2019s quantum-inspired technology to accelerate logistics flows, which reduces port traffic congestion and cuts CO2 emissions.Working with Fujitsu, HPA has proven the potential to reduce congestion in its harbor area. Applying Fujitsu\u2019s quantum-inspired Digital Annealer1 technology and services to real traffic data, HPA has established the possibility of optimizing traffic throughput across the harbor area, while still leveraging the existing traffic control infrastructure.Instead of local management of individual traffic-light managed crossings, the quantum-inspired approach optimizes the entire grid. This significantly cuts dwell times for ships, trucks and cars, resulting in faster supply chain interactions \u2013 and leads to lower levels of greenhouse gases.Through the use of the Fujitsu Digital Annealer, the HPA has noted significant improvements in areas including:Reduced travel time up to 15% for cars and trucks in the supply chainFaster journeys to and from work for employeesLower CO2 emissions from trucks and carsFaster turnaround for container ships leading to increased flow of goodsGreater capacity to handle trucks in the confined space of the HPALess traffic congestion within the harbor areaThe approach is a world-first for HPA, which is developing a new, holistic way to optimize all its available infrastructure of roads, crossings and bridges controlled by traffic lights. These are within an environment constrained by tight geographical limits, the cost of shipping schedule overruns, and specific maritime factors such as tides.Hermann D. Gr\u00fcnfeld, Head of Traffic Management at HPA, says: \u201cWith the global demand for transportation growing relentlessly year on year, logistics infrastructure owners and operators, like HPA, have to find solutions to the challenge of a finite physical footprint for most assets. It\u2019s a common supply chain issue today and will get more important in the coming years. At the same time, we are seeking to reduce our carbon footprint as part of global efforts to address the climate emergency. Optimization is the logical way to address both these challenges. By working with Fujitsu\u2019s quantum-inspired optimization services, we are delighted about the new capabilities to deliver greater capacity for our supply chain partners as well as lowering CO2 emissions.\u201dHPA traffic optimization is calculated by the Fujitsu Digital Annealer.2 The Graz University of Technology with its research focus on traffic planning has provided comprehensive support to all stakeholders throughout the process.Dr. Joseph Reger, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for Central & Eastern Europe at Fujitsu, comments: \u201cFinding and delivering sustainable solutions for business and society is at the core of Fujitsu\u2019s Purpose. Working with HPA, we have demonstrated the possibility and wider potential of applying quantum algorithms to the logistics industry. The business and environmental benefits we are developing with HPA show that Fujitsu\u2019s quantum-inspired optimization services deliver results today \u2013 years, perhaps even a decade, ahead of the timetable for commercially usable quantum computers. These are improvements available today right across the Mobility sector \u2013 not just in maritime logistics.\u201d\n\nNotes to editors1 Fujitsu\u2019s Digital Annealer is a computing architecture inspired by quantum phenomena, offering users the ability to rapidly solve complex combinatorial optimization problems at speeds significantly faster than general-purpose computers without the inherited complications typically associated with quantum computers.2 Calculation sufficed real-time requirements. Optimization is done globally for the whole grid, not parallelizable on classical hardware but well suited for Digital Annealer. Network optimization in less than 10 seconds. Approach scalable for metropole network with hundreds of light-controlled intersections.

Fujitsu and RIKEN leveraged approximately half of Fugaku\u2019s resources (2) to achieve this result, demonstrating the world's fastest performance in this key benchmark.MLPerf HPC measures how many deep learning models can be trained per time unit (throughput performance, 3). Software technology that further refines Fugaku's parallel processing performance has achieved a processing speed approximately 1.77 times faster than that of other systems, demonstrating the world's highest level of performance in the field of large-scale scientific and technological calculations using machine learning.These results were announced as MLPerf HPC version 1.0 on November 17th (November 18th Japan time) at the SC21 High-Performance Computing Conference, which is currently being held as a hybrid event.Fugaku Claims World's Highest Level of Performance in the Field of Large-scale Scientific and Technological Calculations Using Machine LearningMLPerf HPC is a performance competition composed of three separate benchmark programs: CosmoFlow, which predicts cosmological parameters, one of the indicators used in the study of the evolution and structure of the universe, DeepCAM (4), which identifies abnormal weather phenomena, and Open Catalyst (5), which estimates how molecules react on the catalyst surface.For CosmoFlow, Fujitsu and RIKEN used approximately half of the Fugaku system\u2019s entire computing resources to train multiple deep learning models to a certain degree of prediction accuracy and measured from the start time of the model that started the training to the end time of the model that completed the training last to evaluate throughput performance. To further enhance the parallel processing performance of Fugaku, Fujitsu and RIKEN applied technology to programs used on the system that reduce the mutual interference of communication between CPUs, which occurs when multiple learning models are processed in parallel, and also optimize the amount of data communication between CPU and storage. As a result, the system trained 637 deep learning models in 8 hours and 16 minutes, a rate of about 1.29 deep learning models per minute.The measured value of Fugaku claimed first place amongst all the systems for the CosmoFlow training application benchmark category, demonstrating performance at rates approximately 1.77 times faster than other systems. This result revealed that Fugaku has the world's highest level of performance in the field of large-scale scientific and technological calculations using machine learning.Going forward, Fujitsu and RIKEN will make software stacks such as libraries and AI frameworks available to the public that accelerate large-scale machine learning processing developed for this measurement. Widely sharing the knowledge of large-scale machine learning processing using supercomputers gained through this exercise will allow users to leverage world-leading systems for the analysis of simulation results, leading to potential new discoveries in astrophysics and other scientific and technological fields. These resources will also be applied to other large-scale machine learning calculations, such as natural language processing models used in machine translation services, to accelerate technological innovation and contribute to solving societal and scientific problems.About MLPerf HPCMLPerf HPC is a machine learning benchmark created in 2020 by MLCommons, a community that conducts machine learning benchmarks, to evaluate the system performance of a supercomputer for large-scale machine learning calculations, which take an enormous amount of time, to create a performance list of systems that execute machine learning applications. It is used for supercomputers around the world and is anticipated to become a new industry standard.MLPerf HPC was designed to assess the performance of large-scale machine learning models requiring the use of supercomputers. Performance evaluation was carried out for 3 applications: CosmoFlow, DeepCAM, and Open Catalyst. In addition, a benchmark that measures the number of deep learning models trained per time unit has also been newly established.All measurement data are available on the following website:\nRelated links: https:\/\/mlcommons.org\/[1]CosmoFLow:\nA deep learning model for predicting cosmological parameters from three-dimensional simulation results of dark matter distributed in outer space.[2]Approximately half of the whole Fugaku system:\nSince this measurement was conducted during the operation of Fugaku, the measurement scale was halved in consideration of the impact on other researches using Fugaku.[3]Measure how many deep learning models can be learned per unit time (throughput performance):\nA new measurement method for MLPerf.

Fujitsu will help businesses achieve sustainability commitments and alleviate water shortages through the development of the world's first water trading platform for the exchange of plant-derived water, which is based on the concept of sustainable water offsetting.BWT leverages its patented technology to purify and re-mineralize water that is normally discarded during the production of vegetable and fruit juices and the processing of sugarcane, providing this plant-derived purified water to areas where it often proves difficult to secure safe drinking water.The new BWX platform will rely on the FUJITSU Track and Trust service, which uses blockchain technology to ensure end-to-end transparency and traceability of processes including the refinement, sales, purchase, delivery and usage of the product. With a planned launch date of April 2022, both companies envision the new BWX platform contributing to the realization of greater safety and security in water trading, and ultimately aim to create an open market in which companies including juice concentration facilities, sugar mills, alcohol distilleries, and beverage manufacturers can sell water purified by the patented Botanical Water process.Terry Paule, CEO at Botanical Water Technologies comments, \u201cReducing all wastage from industrial processes is a key pillar of a \u201ccircular economy\u201d. The focus of Fujitsu to create a better society through innovation and their breakthrough methodologies are the main reasons for our co-creation journey with them. With our Botanical Water technology we can, for example, recover up to 60% of the water in sugarcane that is still accessible after sugar extraction and produce clean, environmentally green and safe drinking water. Food and beverage manufacturers with excess water produced by the Botanical Water process can either put it to circular use as a sustainable ingredient, market it as AquaBotanical plant-based water or offer water credits on the BWX platform as part of their water positive ESG programs and non-financial indicators.\u201dFrederik De Breuck, Head of the FUJITSU Track and Trust Solution Center comments, \u201cOur new blockchain solution, the FUJITSU Track and Trust service, has been developed and launched at the FUJITSU Track and Trust Solution Center in Belgium. To realize the groundbreaking initiative of net-zero water trading with BWT, we have proposed a private and permissioned blockchain-based platform that leverages the Track and Trust solution. With this solution at the core, our multidisciplinary team continues to build blockchain solutions that support the realization of our customers' management visions and the optimal resolution of global social issues under a global structure of co-creation and collaboration with our bases in India, the United Kingdom, and Japan.BackgroundAccording to the UN, about four billion people \u2013 nearly two-thirds of the global population \u2013 experience severe water scarcity during at least one month of the year (3). The UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030 recognize the urgency of addressing this water scarcity.Amid growing interest in the environment and the SDGs, beverage manufacturers are focusing their efforts on reducing the environmental impact of their business through actions like the reduction of CO2 emissions, the conservation of water sources, and the reduction of water consumption at production facilities.About Botanical Water ExchangeThe new BWX platform will deliver unprecedented supply chain traceability using blockchain technology. Juice concentration facilities, sugar mills, and alcohol distilleries equipped with BWT\u2019s equipment will be able to purify water that would otherwise be discarded during the production process. Manufacturers can sell this water to other food and beverage manufacturers on the BWX platform or put it into circular use at their own facility.Companies that want to use Botanical Water in their factories can purchase it via the BWX platform from the nearest Botanical Water refinery. In this way, companies can lower transportation costs, reduce the environmental footprint of their operations, and ultimately contribute to the achievement of both carbon and water neutrality targets.By purchasing \u201cwater credits\u201d (4) that can be redeemed on the BWX platform, companies can also donate the same amount of water consumed at their facilities in order to reduce their environmental impact to zero as part of their water positive ESG and corporate compliance programs.For example, companies that use a large amount of water for their business can offset this water usage through the purchase of water credits, which allow them to provide clean drinking water to water-scarce communities and run charity activities through the Botanical Water Foundation not-for-profit organization.About \u201cFUJITSU Track and Trust\u201dThe FUJITSU Track and Trust service leverages blockchain technology and draws on a variety of open source software, industry knowledge, information on trends, as well as Fujitsu\u2019s know-how gained through the management of systems operations for tens of thousands of customer cases.In addition to authentication and account management, which are required when applying blockchain technologies to business operations, Fujitsu builds on its extensive industry knowledge and integrates its expertise in areas including UI, infrastructure, and networks to offer small-start platforms tailored to its customers\u2019 businesses by adopting an agile approach.[1]up to 3 trillion liters annually:\nBotanical Water Technologies estimated drinking water production capacity.[2]ESG:\nAn environment necessary for long-term corporate growth and for the realization of a sustainable world with three principles: \u201cEnvironment\u201d, \u201cSocial\u201d and \u201cGovernance\u201d[3]about four billion people \u2013 nearly two-thirds of the global population \u2013 experience severe water scarcity during at least one month of the year:https:\/\/www.unwater.org\/water-facts\/scarcity\/[4]Water credits:\nA concept similar to that of carbon credits where companies trade mainly for use in water offset. When a company purchases water credits to offset its water use in the manufacturing and distribution of products and services, and the same amount of water is donated, it is offset and the company's water use is reduced.Related LinksFujitsu\u2019s Data Driven ManagementFujitsu\u2019s Commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in 2015 represent a set of common goals to be achieved worldwide by 2030.

MSK Group\u2019s award-winning project improved data management for hospitals in western Russia, resulting in the more effective management of resources and improved patient care. The projects submitted by the two runners-up, Dataware and 4Way Solutions, also addressed pandemic and digital transformation challenges.Fujitsu\u2019s annual SELECT Innovation Awards recognize the crucial role played by channel in delivering projects that create new value and address businesses\u2019 challenges. This year, judges placed particular emphasis on projects that leverage the wider Fujitsu ecosystem, help address the challenges reflected in the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and those that deployed Fujitsu\u2019s key portfolios: Workplace, Data, Hybrid Cloud and SAP solutions.Fernanda Catarino, Fujitsu Head of Channel, Alliances and Ecosystem Europe, comments: \"A year and a half into the pandemic, there\u2019s no doubt that technology has helped us all adapt to new ways of working. But it has also been a key factor in our path back to normality. I\u2019m proud that so many of our region\u2019s partners continue to be part of our collective solution to this crisis. Thanks to their innovation and expertise, Fujitsu SELECT partners are creating real positive change for their communities.\u201dAward winner MSK Group helped consolidate data for medical facilities in the Samara region of its native western Russia.

The latest enhancements quickly deliver a curated shortlist of leading regional experts and enable channel and non-reselling partners to seamlessly start interacting directly or via a discussion forum.The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital transformation for many businesses. In turn, this is driving rapid change in the IT channel. Partners are stepping up to become trusted collaborators and address their customers\u2019 business challenges but often lack the full breadth of skills necessary to tackle projects alone. By pooling complementary skills, knowledge and resources, partners can collectively access more extensive opportunities without investing heavily in expanding their skillsets. The Fujitsu SELECT Ecosystem Platform enables partners to rapidly identify collaborators with complementary superpowers and makes it easy to start working together immediately.Fujitsu\u2019s Ecosystem Platform is designed to make the whole process seamless.

Most organizations globally are now undertaking a wholesale re-evaluation of what they mean by \u2018work\u2019 and how they can attract and retain the best talent to add value to their organizations. By implementing technology in a human-centric way we can create workforces that are more inclusive and sustainable. ISG clearly identifies Fujitsu as a leading partner for any organization seeking workplace transformation driven by employee and customer experiences.\u201dISG\u2019s methodology matches vendors to client archetypes to align provider capabilities\nAn important and practical aspect of ISG\u2019s methodology is matching vendors to client archetypes1 \u201cto align sets of client requirements with known provider capabilities\u201d. As a result, ISG defines Fujitsu as the leader in two critical archetypes for the future of work:\u2018Workplace Transformer\u2019 means that ISG considers Fujitsu well-matched to clients \u201copen to a wholesale change in an end-to-end process\u201d. Clients of this archetype, says ISG, \u201chave one central transformation program comprising the physical workplace, digital workplace and human workplace rather than just separately or focusing on one driver... They aim to rationalize property, globalize the workforce with local experts, ensure that supply chains are resilient, and provide clients with highly agile ways of working.\u201d\u2018Experience Evangelist\u2019 is the second archetype where ISG acknowledges Fujitsu\u2019s particular strength. This is relevant for organizations focused on employees \u201cwho deliver the core business to internal and external customers\u201d. Here, new technologies are needed to positively impact work-life balance and enable flexible working while also enhancing communication and collaboration. ISG\u2019s report says businesses fitting this archetype are \u201copen to re-imagining how their workforce can serve customers globally while doing away with a local delivery model\u201d.According to ISG, Leaders are providers who can demonstrate both portfolio attractiveness and competitive strength. To achieve coveted leadership status, providers must have proven competencies in innovation, power, stability, ecosystem, business model and backed by case studies \u2013 as well as requiring a strong strategy and vision.\n\nNotes to editors1ISG\u2019s archetype reports examine outsourcing maturity in totality by identifying changing buying behavior on the demand side and matching it with the evolving capabilities on the supply side. Broadly based on the global capabilities of services companies, an ISG Provider Lens\u2122 archetype report summarizes the relative capabilities of service providers and their ability to address the requirements of typical and frequently-encountered categories of enterprise buyers (archetypes).

To kick-start co-creation activities, Fujitsu has made a strategic investment in Autofleet through a corporate venture capital fund managed by its subsidiary Fujitsu Ventures Limited (1).Logistics represents a critical element in the infrastructure of society, and enriches peoples\u2019 lives by supporting economic development within a complex ecosystem. Changes in peoples\u2019 lifestyles with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has upended existing consumer business models, highlighting the importance of logistics as demand for shipping and e-commerce services increase dramatically.These trends have exposed fundamental weaknesses in the global supply chain, as the logistics industry confronts new challenges posed by labor shortages and environmental issues due to increased CO2 emissions. With this latest move, Fujitsu and Autofleet recognize the urgent need to develop more dynamic and resilient models for logistics to ultimately deliver more efficient and environmentally sustainable approaches.By combining Autofleet's platform, with Fujitsu\u2019s know-how in systems development and industry expertise in logistics, the two companies aim to leverage their joint activities to develop and bring to market sustainable global logistics solutions.The two companies envision use cases including solutions for the dynamic allocation of trucks for last-mile transport for home delivery, where demand for logistics fluctuates widely, as well as vehicle matching (2) for emergency transport, the coordination of mixed vehicles transporting passengers, and freight with public transport. The companies will also explore the possibilities of route optimization solutions based on the location of charging points for electric vehicles, which are being introduced in the logistics industry with the aim of achieving decarbonization targets.This partnership will be introduced during a virtual session during Fujitsu's flagship digital experience, \"Fujitsu ActivateNow 2021\" Session 2 (https:\/\/event.jp.fujitsu.com\/activatenow\/), during the \"Green DX Accelerated Through Sustainable and Resilient Logistics\" part of the \"Trusted Society Day\" scheduled for Friday, October 29 for audiences in Japan (available on demand from October 29 until November 30).[1]Fujitsu Ventures Limited:\nChiyoda-ku, Tokyo; President and CEO: Hideaki Yajima\nhttps:\/\/www.fujitsu.com\/jp\/group\/fjv\/en\/#about[2]Matching of vehicles:\nmatching of truck operators with cosigners for freight transportationRelated LinksFujitsu Accelerates Investment in Promising Tech Startups with Establishment of 10 Billion Yen Corporate Venture Capital Fund and Management Subsidiary (March 31, 2021)About FujitsuFujitsu is the leading Japanese information and communication technology (ICT) company offering a full range of technology products, solutions and services.

It will furthermore help physicians to effectively and precisely choose the medicine expected to achieve the best results based on patients\u2019 genomic variants and to achieve better results by avoiding unnecessary treatments.Aichi Cancer Center and Fujitsu will continue cooperation to further enhance the application of AI technology in cancer genomic medicine in order to contribute to further achievements in this field.BackgroundCancer is the leading cause of death in Japan, and the number of new cases now exceeds one million per year with the trend rising in recent years.Therefore, cancer genomic medicine or precision oncology, a form of personalized medical care based on the genomic variants in each cancer, has been gaining increasing attention. Although a nationwide system to enhance cancer genomic medicine has been established in Japan, the shortage of specialists in this field represents a major issue.The current situation thus demands further expansion of programs to train medical specialists as well as the development of an AI with capabilities comparable to those of medical specialists in order to support more effective medical treatment.In November 2019, Aichi Cancer Center and Fujitsu concluded a comprehensive joint research agreement (4) in order to drive the application of AI technology in the field of cancer genomic medicine and jointly promoted R&D of technologies and systems applied during clinical tests.About the newly developed technologyDrawing on Aichi Cancer Center\u2019s knowledge of drug selection with Fujitsu\u2019s AI-based data-integration technology, the new solution enables users to organize information like test data of effective medical treatment for different cancer types and genomic variants in external medical databases by grouping information under common terms and data formats.The new system is also able to build a Knowledge Graph by automatically linking data with the same underlying subjects (5).For cancer treatment, the system can deliver an objective score about the expected level of effectiveness of a planned course of treatment based on the information about the patients\u2019 cancer type and genomic variants. In this way, the system can help to efficiently narrow down the number of possible options of drugs that are likely to be highly effective for each patient.Moving forward, by combining this system with Fujitsu\u2019s AI technology for language processing which identifies terms and phrases used in research papers from context (6), physicians will be able to instantaneously refer to relevant information from a total of more than 1.2 million medical papers when evaluating the effects of a planned course of treatment. Thus, this new system will not only help physicians to verify the validity of their drug selections but also to improve the overall efficiency of their work.Figure1. The newly developed systemDuring the current verification trials, which were supervised by an expert panel (7) at Aichi Cancer Center, the system was used to evaluate the effects of drug treatment with approximately 450 patients. Results showed that standard treatments for eight different genomic variants could be successfully determined.\n\nThe system also proved to be efficient in identifying drug candidates (8) from a wide range of treatments based on an objective score of the effectiveness of medications and the characteristics of related cancer cells.Based on the system results, physicians will be able to efficiently collect various information about the level of effectiveness of a specific treatment based on the genomic variants of individual patients.\n\nIn this way, the new system will help to create an environment where physicians will be able to choose appropriate medications and to propose new treatments even if they are not specialists with a high level of knowledge in cancer genomic medicine.Future plansAichi Cancer Center and Fujitsu will continue collaboration in order to verify and improve the ability of the current system to integrate and output data from multiple databases and actively promote the full-scale introduction of an easy-to-use system in clinical practice of cancer genomics.The two partners will furthermore strive to develop an intra-hospital information integration environment to assist the expert panel with a solution that enables a more accurate, efficient, and stress-free selection of the right treatment for their patients in order to contribute to a more personalized approach to cancer treatment.Aichi Cancer Center and Fujitsu will furthermore consider using the improved system to determine the start or participation of clinical trials by adding clinical information and to propose potential new drug targets through analyzing integrated data from a research perspective.Both parties will continue to improve the system to make the results more reliable and user-friendly, with the aim of expanding its use to Japanese hospitals nationwide that provide cancer genomic medicine.Fujitsu plans to continue practical use of the technology in clinical settings, to ultimately offer customers new solutions to support their well-being (9) and \u201cHealthy Living\u201d (10). Based on the results from the current trials, Fujitsu also aims to develop a new AI technology able to recommend new treatment methods by linking clinical data extracted from electronic medical record systems and genome data in order to create various solutions to improve the quality of life of each patient.[1]Aichi Cancer Center:\nLocation: Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture; President: Takashi Takahashi[2]Genomic variants:\nStructural alterations in the genome.[3]Knowledge Graph:\nA dataset that uses connections representing relationships between information collected from a variety of textual information sources such as essays and research results.[4]A comprehensive joint research agreement:\"Fujitsu Laboratories and Aichi Cancer Center in Japan Sign Comprehensive Joint Research Agreement to Drive Advances in Cancer Genomic Medicine with AI Technology\"(November 29, 2019; Press release)[5]Automatically linking data with the same underlying subjects:\"Fujitsu Laboratories Develops Technology for Automatically Linking with Open Data throughout the World\"(January 16, 2014; Press release)[6]Fujitsu\u2019s AI technology for language processing which identifies terms and phrases used in research papers from context:\"Fujitsu Improves Efficiency in Cancer Genomic Medicine in Joint AI Research with the Institute of Medical Science at the University of Tokyo\"(November 6, 2019; Press release)[7]Expert Panel:\nCommittee of experts that analyses the patients\u2019 genomic variants and determines individual treatment strategies based on the results[8]Drug candidates:\nFor example, researchers found that EGFR inhibitors were effective under certain conditions when the BRAF protein was mutated as denoted \u201cG466V\u201d.[9]Well-being:\nState of physical, mental, and social well-being[10]\"Healthy Living\":\nOne of Fujitsu\u2019s seven key focus areasAbout Aichi Cancer CenterAichi Cancer Center is one of the largest and oldest comprehensive cancer centers in Japan.

(Head Office: Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo: President: Tsuyoshi Hasebe), leveraging data analysis tools including Foundry from Palantir Technologies in order to provide new insights into the Japanese electoral process.Drawing on the knowledge of Nikkei, the joint project aims to provide readers and voters with in-depth coverage that combines data from previous election results with region-specific data, including employment rates, demographic data, etc. as well as information about political candidates running for office in parliamentary elections. The insights obtained from these analyses will be published in the Nikkei starting October 17, 2021.By gaining new insights from data, Fujitsu will further strengthen its efforts to drive \u201cDigital Shifts\u201d towards data-driven management models with the potential to innovate customers\u2019 businesses, industries, and society.BackgroundIn contrast to many countries in the world, where news outlets provide extensive, data-centric analysis for major political events like presidential elections, Japanese media coverage often focuses more narrowly on the results of the elections rather than offering a broader analysis of the context and data informing citizens\u2019 voting behavior and the final results of the election.Data like voting rates, election results, and election related expenses in Japan are often difficult to analyze as electoral districts are not identical with administrative districts and electoral districts are frequently redistricted. This makes it challenging to offer coverage on the \u201cbigger picture,\u201d as data is hard to match with region-specific information like the demography and employment rate of administrative districts and information about candidates in the lower house elections.To help address these challenges, Fujitsu and Political News Group of the Policy News Unit of Nikkei, Japan\u2019s leading financial newspaper, jointly utilized a broad range of information including election related data held by Nikkei and data open to the public to analyze previous election results and voting behaviors in order to provide readers and voters with a new perspective through data-driven political coverage of elections.About the Joint ProjectWith this project, Fujitsu\u2019s data scientists analyzed past election results by combining publicly available election related data and census data, chosen based on the knowledge of Nikkei. For these analyses Fujitsu leveraged the data analysis tool \u201cFoundry\u201d from Palantir Technologies Inc., which empowers organizations to rapidly process large amounts of data. By using this tool, Nikkei\u2019s political reporters can draw new insights from publicly available data.This approach offers Nikkei\u2019s political reporters a new tool to create contents that offer readers and voters greater nuance and new insights into topics like the effects of regional characteristics on voting behavior or the effects of economic conditions on electoral outcomes.The project further aims to give journalists access to objective, empirical data to reinforce conclusions that have conventionally been based on their own experience and intuition. By adding such new, additional value to the media coverage of elections, the joint project aims to contribute to even greater interest and participation in politics from readers and voters in the future.1. Publication media:The Nikkei morning edition, The Nikkei Online Edition, etc.2. Schedule:Analysis: August to October 2021\nPublication: Starting October 17, 20213. Contents:Insights related to the following two topics will be published in the upcoming articlesTheme 1: Regional characteristics and their effect on election trends and results\nThe focus of this analysis will be the question of how regional characteristics of electoral districts influence election results.This analysis aims to clarify the characteristics of voting behavior of residents in the relevant electoral districts by analyzing attribute data like age, gender, occupation and education in relation to data about population decrease, economic indicators, and past election results in the respective districts.Theme 2: Characteristics of council members and their effects on election trends\nBased on the characteristics of election winners, analysis will be conducted to help identify possible factors (including age, position and electoral funds) that enabled candidates to win elections. This analysis will also focus on factors like reputation, support groups, and \u201cfinancial muscles\u201d of candidates.Future PlansFujitsu will draw on the experience gained through this project to offer customers further solutions to leverage complex valuable data in order to contribute to \u201cDigital Shifts\u201d towards a data-driven, innovative management paradigm with the potential to transform not only customers\u2019 businesses but also industries and society as a whole.Related LinksFujitsu Enters Strategic Alliance with Palantir Technologies Inc. and Becomes Flagship Technology Partner for Palantir Technologies JapanFujitsu\u2019s Commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in 2015 represent a set of common goals to be achieved worldwide by 2030.

The research is planned to commence at the University of Tokyo Hospital from October 25.Since December 2019, Fujitsu has been making progress with research and development of proprietary AI technology (2) in collaboration with the University of Tokyo Hospital. This research draws on data from patients that have visited the University of Tokyo Hospital to date and includes approximately 630,000 pieces of electrocardiographic data and data from approximately 140,000 cardiac ultrasounds (echocardiography) (3). This initiative has now succeeded in detecting patients with abnormal heart movements with high accuracy.The AI will be used in clinical field research to estimate the presence or absence of abnormal heart movements based on the data of patients undergoing electrocardiographic procedures at the University of Tokyo Hospital. Patients identified by the AI as having abnormal heart movements will undergo echocardiography, and the effectiveness will be verified by comparing the results of doctors\u2019 diagnosis with the results predicted by the AI. Fujitsu will leverage this AI to detect heart disease at an early stage to prevent progression to serious illness in patients and strengthen its vision of \"Healthy Living\", promoting well-being for people throughout society.This initiative will be introduced at Fujitsu ActivateNow 2021, a global event to be held from October 12 in online format.BackgroundHeart disease is the second leading cause of death in Japan (4), and electrocardiography, which detects abnormalities in the heart muscle and irregular pulses based on the waveform of electrical pulses in the heart, is widely used as a diagnostic tool to detect heart disease at an early stage. It remains difficult, however, to detect abnormalities in the shape and movement of the heart using only electrocardiograms. In medical practice, in addition to electrocardiography, doctors use a stethoscope to detect abnormal heart sounds (murmurs, arrythmia, etc.) based on the patient's description of their symptoms, followed by echocardiography to detect abnormalities in heart shape and movement. However, because echocardiographic diagnostics can only be performed in a limited number of facilities with specialized doctors and laboratory technicians, it is difficult to offer this for all patients. This makes early detection difficult, and when problems are detected, the progression of the disease may already be advanced. In the treatment of heart disease, early detection and appropriate treatment are a vital issue in medical practice.Since December 2019, in collaboration with a research group headed by Dr. Katsuhito Fujiu, Project Associate Professor, and Dr. Issei Komuro, Professor in the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at the University of Tokyo Hospital, Fujitsu has been engaged in research and development utilizing AI to detect heart disease from electrocardiogram data, leveraging Fujitsu's proprietary waveform analysis technology, TDA (topological data analysis) (5). Going forward, Fujitsu will work to verify the effectiveness of AI in actual medical practice to estimate the presence or absence of abnormalities in cardiac function from electrocardiogram data, and will start clinical research at the University of Tokyo Hospital.Clinical Research OverviewBased on the electrocardiogram data of patients examined at the University of Tokyo Hospital, Fujitsu and the University of Tokyo Hospital will verify the effectiveness of detection of abnormal heart movement by AI.1.

Field trials were conducted between November 2020 and September 2021 under an outsourcing contract with the Japan Coast Guard to demonstrate the usefulness of the new technology.Fujitsu previously leveraged AI technology to calculate and predict vessel collision risks based on the current position, speed and direction of the ship. Now, an additional algorithm has been added to this technology in order to calculate the degree to which the vessel is following its course, enabling more accurate risk prevention.This new feature makes it possible to only provide alerts in situations with a high risk of collision - changes of the course along a route will thus no longer be falsely detected as dangerous steering.Field trials of the technology were conducted at the Tokyo Wan Vessel Traffic Service Center under an outsourcing contract with the Japan Coast Guard, which manages maritime traffic control services. Results of the trial demonstrated that this technology can reduce unnecessary alerts by about 90% on all sea routes, especially on curved sections where alerts frequently occurred.This improved technology enables the early recognition of vessels prone to risks and a speedy initial response in order to prevent collisions, while also contributing to improving maritime traffic safety by reducing excessive traffic control operations as well as human errors.Based on the results of the field trials, Fujitsu plans to provide safe navigation support services beginning in March 2022 for players in the maritime industry globally. Through this service, Fujitsu aims to ensure both the safety of maritime traffic control as well as vessel operation and will support the construction of resilient maritime traffic systems.BackgroundMore than 99% of Japan's imports and exports are conducted through seaborne trade. However, the recent impact of COVID-19 has greatly restricted people\u2019s movement, making logistics more important than ever. At the same time, recent serious maritime accidents around the world have drawn increased attention to the importance of ensuring the safety of maritime traffic. This not only includes direct damage to the ship hull and cargo, but also indirect damage caused by lost opportunities due to inoperable ships, as well as serious damage to human life and the environment.Many maritime accidents are said to be caused by human error. Particularly in busy sea lanes near ports and in bays, there is a need for technology that helps operators to understand the movements of vessels and provide them with information to avoid risks.However, most of the methods to predict vessel collision risks currently in practical use take into account that vessels navigate along straight lines starting from their current positions. As a result, unnecessary alerts frequently occur when a vessel navigates on curved sections of sea routes, officially defined by laws and regulations like the Maritime Traffic Safety Act. Therefore, the correct timing of risk notifications to vessels depends on the experience and skill of the operation controller.In fiscal 2019, under an outsourcing contract with the Japan Coast Guard, which operates a navigation support system that combines radar and the Automatic Identification System (AIS) (1) to analyze movements of vessels in order to provide them with relevant information to improve the safety of navigation, Fujitsu leveraged AI technology to predict vessel collision risks in the Tokyo Bay area and to detect other areas where collision risks are highly concentrated. Fujitsu has confirmed the effectiveness of this method for early detection of collision risks.\n\nFujitsu additionally conducted joint field trials with the Japan Coast Guard in order to improve maritime traffic safety and to establish a technology that can support the operations of the Japan Coast Guard.About the newly developed technologyUntil now, predictions of vessel collision risks had been calculated based on the current position, speed and direction of the ship. Fujitsu has now developed a new, additional algorithm to calculate if a ship follows a specified route (patent pending).With conventional technology, excessive alerts had occurred in cases where two vessels were judged to travelling straight along their current course in the vicinity of curved sections of sea routes - by utilizing the new algorithm described above, collision risks will now be categorized as low when the two vessels follow a specified route in a curvilinear manner.This new algorithm thus reduces unnecessary alerts and makes it possible to more accurately determine the risks of collision between vessels (patent pending).Fig. 1 Comparison of conventional collision risk prediction with new technologyJoint Field Trials with the Japan Coast Guard1. Date and TimeNovember 17, 2020 (Tuesday) to September 2, 2021 (Thursday)2. LocationTokyo Wan Vessel Traffic Service Center (Place: Naka-ku, Yokohama City, Kanagawa Prefecture)3. Contents and results of the field trialsIn cooperation with the Japan Coast Guard, Fujitsu conducted statistical and quantitative evaluations in the Tokyo Bay area of the effectiveness of its collision risk detection technology by comparing cases where the new technology has been applied with cases where it had not been applied.After a fixed evaluation period, Fujitsu confirmed that unnecessary alerts could be reduced by approximately 90% in comparison to conventional technology for all sea routes including sea routes with curved sections.In addition, Fujitsu conducted a collation analysis of the operational records for the actual maritime traffic control operations of the Tokyo Wan Vessel Traffic Service Center which manages maritime traffic control services. This analysis was based on records of the operations performed by the operation controller, including the provision of information to vessels, as well as information drawn from interviews with the operation controller, and the alerts detected by the newly established technology.As a result, about 95% of the high risk events (2) for which the Operator issued warnings or recommendations were correctly judged as high risk, and it was confirmed that this technology is close to the Operator's judgment and useful for operational support.Fig. 2 Screen comparison image of collision risk predictionFuture PlansBy upgrading the conventional collision risk prediction technology with this new algorithm, Fujitsu aims to provide a safe navigation support service that can detect collision risks with high accuracy even in curved sections of sea routes by March 2022 to players in the maritime industry globally.Fujitsu also aims to provide a service equipped with an algorithm currently under development that quantitatively evaluates whether a vessel is following a route by analyzing the characteristics of the vessel, such as its size and type, as well as data from past navigation performance by September 2023. In this way Fujitsu will be able to ensure both the safety of maritime traffic control and vessel navigation and to contribute to the construction of a resilient maritime traffic system.[1]Automatic Identification System (AIS):\nsystem that collects and provides information of the position, speed and course of vessels using radio waves[2]Correct judgement of about 95% of high risk events:\n53 out of 64 cases were correctly evaluated as high risk events exceeding the threshold limit value, 8 further cases were correctly judged as high risks events close to exceeding the threshold limit valueRelated LinksFujitsu Verifies AI Technology to Predict Vessel Collision Risks in Marine Traffic Control, Improves Maritime Security\u00a0 (April 15, 2020 Press Releases)Fujitsu\u2019s Commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in 2015 represent a set of common goals to be achieved worldwide by 2030.

The Digital Annealer will play a role in automating aspects of the stowage planning process for NYK\u2019s dedicated car carriers, an enormously complex task involving a vast number of possible stowage patterns depending on the number of vehicles loaded, models of vehicles, and the number of ports called along the shipping route. After successful initial tests, Fujitsu and NYK have launched a real-world operational trial of the technology on September 1st with an aim to commence full-scale operational use in April 2022.In initial tests, NYK contributed its decades of industry experience to work with Fujitsu to develop a new algorithm for the Digital Annealer, which the partners leveraged to successfully reduce the time it takes to create a stowage plan for a dedicated car carrier from 6 hours to 2.5 hours per ship. The companies anticipate that this will result in a potential reduction of 4,000 working hours per year, allow for agile responses to sudden changes in plans, and prevent variations in stowage plan quality from person to person based on their relative experience and skill.Moving forward, Fujitsu and NYK will continue working together to further improve the system by increasing processing speed and improving the accuracy of output results during trial operations. The two companies ultimately aim to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions across the automobile shipping supply chain, improving the efficiency of cargo handling and ship operations to contribute to the realization of a more sustainable future.BackgroundNYK operates a global automobile shipping business that links Japan and other parts of the world\u2014each ship in its fleet of car carriers holds more than several thousand vehicles. Cars are loaded one by one onto these car carriers at predetermined distance in accordance with a prepared stowage plan. When a car carrier with a maximum loading capacity of about 7,000 cars and 12 decks loads and unloads more than 60 types of cars of different heights and widths while calling at more than 10 ports, for instance, the number of possible patterns for loading and unloading can exceed 10 to the 2,000th power. Planners face many complexities and challenges when creating stowage plans that can satisfy conditions including how to load vehicles at a loading ratio close to the maximum capacity of the ship or how to secure enough space on the ship to safely load and unload the car carriers.Traditionally, professional planners can only successfully create these plans after gaining considerable experience and mastering stowage patterns and arrangement methods to create stowage plans that fulfill these rigorous standards. Nevertheless, issues including individual differences in the quality of stowage plans due to the relative experience and skills of each planner, as well as significant increases in workload arising from alterations to stowage plans due to sudden changes in conditions, mean that it can take up to six hours to create a plan for just one vessel, posing an ongoing challenge to efforts to streamline the process.Fujitsu\u2019s Digital Annealer Dramatically Streamlines Stowage PlanningIn order to solve these problems, NYK has introduced Fujitsu\u2019s Digital Annealer to help optimize its stowage planning. Fujitsu\u2019s Digital Annealer is a computing architecture inspired by quantum phenomena, offering users the ability to rapidly solve complex combinatorial optimization problems at speeds significantly faster than general purpose computers and without the added complications and costs typically associated with quantum computing methods. With the introduction of the Digital Annealer, Fujitsu built a cloud-based system that automatically completes the work of planning the optimum stowage position of a vehicle that takes into account of various conditions, which is the most important task of creating a stowage plan. This is accomplished by drawing on information from NYK's internal systems on the size of vehicles to be loaded and the port to be loaded, and using the Digital Annealer to solve the problem, a process that takes approximately 30 minutes.In preliminary trials prior to the introduction of this system, Fujitsu and NYK were able to reduce the work required by experienced planners to create a loading plan from as much as six hours per vessel to about 2.5 hours.The companies anticipate that this will enable planners to reduce their stowage planning time by 4,000 hours or more per year, resulting in a possible expansion of business opportunities arising from the speed of decision making, as well as significant effects such as enabling planners to more efficiently respond to sudden changes in plans and reducing the variability of stowage planning quality due to differences in planner experience.Overview of a Car CarrierNYK's LNG fueled car carrier SAKURA LEADERSystem overviewFuture PlansNYK is promoting the further improvement of highly safe navigation and efficiency through the digitization of ships, as well as the reduction of environmental impact in accordance with its concept of \"Digitalization and Green\", in order to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

(Head Office: Naruto, Tokushima, Japan; President and Representative Director: Shinichi Ogasawara; \u201cOPF\u201d) and Fujitsu Ltd. (Head Office: Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan; Representative Director: Takahito Tokita; \u201cFujitsu\u201d) began exploratory joint research to develop AI services to predict risks of undernutrition in patients together with the National Cancer Center Japan (\u201cNCC\u201d) and the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology (\u201cNCGG\u201d).This study is an exploratory joint research initiative aimed at developing an AI model for early prediction of risks of undernutrition in patients by conducting an AI analysis after anonymization of medical data for 10,000 cancer patients accumulated in the electronic medical record system of the NCC Hospital East (1). The research will be conducted until the end of March 2022.Undernutrition in cancer patients is known to be associated with poor prognosis (2), but patients\u2019 nutritional status may vary depending on the progression of the condition and the treatment. In order to continue treatment while preventing the deterioration of nutritional status, it is important to intervene at an accurate time. For this purpose, it is necessary to establish appropriate clinical nutritional management based on predictive models.In this study, OPF will narrow down the factors that cause undernutrition in patients by medical data analysis such as clinical laboratory values and treatment information, and construct and verify the AI model to predict risks of undernutrition at an early stage. Fujitsu will play a role in supporting the analysis of medical data using ICT, including a platform for the safe and secure use of medical data currently under development. NCC provides anonymized medical data and medical knowledge on cancer treatment, which is required to construct and verify predictive models, and NCGG provides knowledge on undernutrition determination.By promoting the use of the AI prediction model developed through this study to medical institutions nationwide, the two companies aim to contribute to the improvement of the effectiveness of treatments by linking it to early nutritional intervention for patients at high risk of undernutrition in the future.Based on the management vision of \u201cThe Best Partner in Clinical Nutrition,\u201d OPF is dedicated to developing not only products, but also services that contribute to prevention and treatment of diseases through the use of digital technologies, and providing solutions that can contribute to the health of people.Fujitsu strives to build trust in society through the power of innovation, promoting \"Healthy Living\" initiatives that support the well-being in people\u2019s daily lives.

The fifth iteration of this survey examines how organizations responded to the changes that the pandemic caused and business leaders\u2019 perceptions around priorities in the post-pandemic world. The survey results revealed the factors that contributed to an effective pandemic response, identifying essential organizational capabilities and important insights in designing successful businesses after the pandemic.BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed the ways in which we live and work. While many people and organizations were forced to change their previous ways, various responses to the pandemic have yielded many different results. Moreover, as the digitalization of business progresses, organizations must increasingly accelerate their own digital transformation initiatives. Against this backdrop, Fujitsu conducted a survey to deliver new insights into how business leaders responded to the pandemic, as well as their perceptions around business priorities in the post-pandemic world.Summary of survey findings1. How did organizations respond to the pandemic?While many online organizations that provide products and services purely online saw revenue increase during the pandemic, half of offline organizations that provide products and services completely offline or partially online experienced decreased revenue. Though the impact to revenue was significant for many, 78% of business leaders from offline organizations said that they were able to effectively respond to the pandemic. The three main factors contributing to their effective pandemic responses included agility, digitalization, and employee well-being.2. Organizations with stronger \u201cdigital muscles\u201d also responded more effectively to the impacts of COVID-19The results of our previous global surveys have consistently indicated that leadership, value from data, a culture of agility, ecosystems, empowered people and business integration are the organizational capabilities that lead to success in digital transformation. Fujitsu refers to these six factors as \u201cdigital muscles.\u201d The analysis of the correlation between the score of an organization\u2019s \u201cdigital muscles\u201d and ability to mount an effective response to the pandemic demonstrates that organizations with better development of these critical capabilities responded more effectively to the unprecedented changes posed by COVID-19.3. Priorities in the post-pandemic world.Resilience is perceived as the top business priority in the post-pandemic world. The survey results indicate that many organizations have understood the importance of a flexible response in the face of changes in an uncertain world. Many respondents also noted the importance of business process automation, data-driven management and a seamless customer experience where online merges with offline.Many business leaders expect more business processes to become automated. The survey revealed that 44% of respondents from offline organizations predicted that more than half of their current business processes that were not yet automated would be automated by 2025. The survey also found that the premium value of Face to Face (F2F) experiences must be revisited. In fact, 64% of respondents from online organizations thought that the value of F2F engagement would increase because premium services that cannot be offered online will become more exclusive. 49% of respondents from offline organizations had the same opinion, exceeding the number of respondents who thought the value of F2F engagement would decline.In last year\u2019s survey, it was already apparent that most business leaders had recognized the importance of delivering value to society. The pandemic reinforced this trend. In this year\u2019s survey, 78% of respondents from offline organizations said they thought the importance of delivering value to society had increased as a result of the pandemic.Fujitsu defines its Purpose as making the world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation. The findings of this survey will help Fujitsu to continue to serve as a trusted DX partner, simultaneously helping customers to succeed in business and to provide even greater value to society.Survey overview1.

This initiative will be implemented as part of the \u201cPost 5G Infrastructure Enhancement R&D Project\u201d under the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) of Japan. Both companies are scheduled to build a verification environment using these technologies in their respective laboratories from August of this year and will begin interoperability testing. Leveraging this verification environment offers the potential to significantly streamline interoperability verification between base station equipment from different vendors.Through this initiative, Fujitsu, NEC, and NEDO will accelerate the global reach of base station equipment that conforms to O-RAN specifications and contribute to stimulating growth and innovation in the open 5G market.1. SummaryWith the start of 5G commercial services in various countries, post 5G (2) with enhanced functions such as ultra-low latency and multiple simultaneous connections is expected to be used in a variety of industries, such as automobile factories. It is expected that the technologies that realize these functions will serve as the core of Japan's competitiveness.In recent years, base station equipment has become more open due to O-RAN fronthaul interface specifications (3) formulated by the O-RAN Alliance (4), and it is becoming possible to connect to RUs (radio units) and CUs \/ DUs (central units \/ distributed units) from a variety of vendors. However, in order to quickly verify interoperability between different vendors' equipment, it is necessary to establish a verification process, develop tools that can be used in common, and to develop a verification environment.Under these circumstances, NEDO commissioned Fujitsu and NEC to conduct R&D on assessment and verification technologies for interoperability between base station equipment in the \u201cPost 5G Infrastructure Enhancement R&D Project,\u201d which is scheduled to run from FY2020 to FY2023. In response, Fujitsu and NEC are building an environment and developing technologies to assess and verify the interoperability of different vendors' equipment and the impact of such connections on the entire network.Fujitsu and NEC have begun developing technologies to verify base station equipment interoperability at their respective facilities in the U.S. and the U.K.. Fujitsu is conducting trials at its Open RAN laboratory hosted at Fujitsu Network Communications, Inc., a Fujitsu group company in the United States, while NEC is doing so at its laboratory in NEC Europe Ltd., London, U.K..2. Characteristics of technology for interoperability verification and establishment of a verification environment1) Significantly improve the efficiency of interoperability verificationFujitsu and NEC will combine their many years of experience and know-how in developing base station equipment compliant with O-RAN fronthaul interface specifications. The two companies will develop technologies to verify the interoperability of various vendors\u2019 equipment for O-RAN fronthaul. The technologies include FHA (5), P-DU (6), test scenario extraction tools (7), test parameter change tools (8), and validation result determination tools (9). Introducing these technologies into the verification environments of both companies' laboratories, will make it possible to significantly improve the efficiency of interoperability verification for different vendors' equipment.2) Verification under conditions close to commercial environmentsIn this project, Fujitsu\u2019s lab in the U.S. and NEC\u2019s lab in the U.K. will make it possible to implement a Conformance Test System that can perform standard tests in accordance with O-RAN specifications and to implement an End-to-End (E2E) Test System that can verify the connection from the core network to the terminal. In addition, by incorporating the newly developed technologies into the interoperability test systems, it will be possible to efficiently conduct system-wide normality verification and performance verification under conditions that are close to the commercial environments of each country and business.Figure 1. Conformance Test System incorporating interoperability verification technologiesFigure 2. E2E Test System incorporating interoperability verification technologies3. Future plansFujitsu and NEC will establish a verification environment using new technologies in their respective laboratories from August of this year, and will begin interoperability testing.

In the case of time-series data, however, there are a wide range of factors that can contribute to AI decision-making. This means that even experts find it difficult to notice what kind of changes in the data contributed to an anomaly detection making it difficult to take appropriate measures to prevent their occurrence.Fujitsu and Inria, more specifically the Inria\u2019s DATASHAPE Project Team led by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chazal in France, have now successfully developed a new technology based on Topological Data Analysis (TDA) (1) that can identify the factors contributing to anomaly detections by AI for time series data and visualize the differences in AI decisions during normal and anomalous circumstances.Fujitsu and Inria anticipate that this will contribute to the analysis of the causes of anomalies in time series data for various phenomena, clarifying the mechanism surrounding the occurrence of anomalies, as well as the discovery of new solutions to these.This technology will be presented as one of just 3% of total submitted papers as a \u201cLong Talk\u201d presentation at the Thirty-eighth International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), the leading international conference in the field of machine learning, which opens virtually from July 18th, 2021.Newly Developed TechnologyFujitsu and Inria have developed an AI technology that can determine the cause of anomalies in time-series data, consisting of the following key features.1) Using an analysis technology developed by Fujitsu that extract features that affect judgement from time-series data and detects anomalies (2), the characteristics that led to the anomalous judgment as well as the unrelated characteristics from the data that was judged to be anomalous by the AI are mapped onto a plane (TDA space).2) The technology transforms the point data of the characteristic that is the cause closer to the point data group of the characteristic that is not the cause on the plane.3) The time-series data is deformed based on the conversion of the characteristics of the point data, and the data judged to be normal is generated.This allows the waveform of normal and anomalous time-series data to be compared and enables the user to visually investigate the cause of the anomaly.Fig. 1 TDA-based technology for identifying the causes detecting anomaliesThe newly developed technology was applied to test the possibility of detecting symptoms of delirium (3) using actual electroencephalography (EEG) data (4) collected in strict accordance with ethical guidelines. Using the newly developed technology, it was confirmed that the characteristics of the brain wave of the time series data coincided with the \u201cslowing\u201d phenomenon (5) that at times accompanies the state of delirium. These results offer the potential to help medical professionals interpret the data to help determine the cause of these symptoms. This may one day contribute to important medical developments, including the ability to discover possible precursors to diseases that have been difficult to identify with conventional techniques, as well as the discovery of preventive treatments. The technology could also be applied to shed light on the mechanisms of diseases that are not yet well-understood.Fig. 2 EEG data of delirium state (blue line) and EEG data judged to be normal generated by this technology (red line)Comments from Dr. Gen Shinozaki, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES, Stanford University School of MedicineDue to the nature of the random signals, it has proven difficult to use EEG data quantitatively and accurately to identify certain disorders. In recent years, advances in data processing technologies, such as AI, have made it possible to better understand the characteristic changes in subtle brain waves. These advances are important not only for diagnosing various disorders, but also for understanding the treatment response and the pathophysiological mechanism. The technology developed by Fujitsu and Inria has successfully captured the unique characteristics of brain waves in patients suffering from delirium. In addition to verifying this, we anticipate that further improvement and practical use of this technology will ultimately offer the potential to achieve accurate diagnosis, monitoring of treatment response and the elucidation of pathophysiology for other disorders.Future PlansFujitsu and Inria plan to encourage the use of the jointly developed technology in field work and experiments at companies and research institutes, and proceed with verifying the technology.[1]Topological Data Analysis (TDA):\nA method for analyzing data in which data are arrayed in a cluster of points in space, and geometric data is extracted from the cluster.[2]an analysis technology developed by Fujitsu that classifies time-series data by features and detects anomalies:Fujitsu and France's Inria Jointly Develop Technology to Automatically Create Anomaly-Detecting AI Models (Press Release: 2020\/3\/16)[3]delirium:\na syndrome, or group of symptoms, caused by a disturbance in the normal functioning of the brain.[4]actual EEG data:\nthe newly developed technology was applied to the electroencephalographic data of approximately 600 patients, who consented to participate in research with Dr. Shinozaki, at the University of Iowa.

By collaborating closely with our customers, can solve their problems, whether that\u2019s simplifying and streamlining the global rice trade, improving the processing of accident claims, or enhancing quality control in manufacturing. Our aim is always to deliver the combination of advanced technologies that most benefits our customers. The results are clear \u2013 we\u2019ve improved efficiency, streamlined processes, and have enabled valued employees to focus on doing what they do best. To be recognized by ISG for the work we have done is truly exceptional.\u201dThree Outstanding Case Studies \u2013 Manufacturing, Insurance, Commodities Trading\n Fujitsu worked with Aioi Nissay Dowa, a pioneer in telematics-based automobile insurance, to develop an intelligent claims service system that accelerates the settlement of accident claims by approximately 50%. Rather than relying on subjective accounts of road traffic accidents, often based on the driver\u2019s recall, the solution developed by Fujitsu can objectively record critical information about an incident. AI-based image recognition technology accurately identifies elements such as pedestrians, white lines or traffic markings and the color of traffic lights, while Fujitsu\u2019s unique high precision 3D position estimation technology accurately records vehicle position and the speed of the vehicles involved in an accident.The second stand-out Fujitsu case study relates to a project undertaken with leading aerospace manufacturer GKN Aerospace to automate defect-recognition in manufacturing complex carbon composite parts. Many of these parts are intended for aircraft structures and consequently require the highest possible level of quality control. Previously, inspecting each part could take up to several hours and required highly skilled operators. Fujitsu implemented an augmented defect recognition (ADR) solution that takes minutes rather than hours to check each part, enhancing operators' capabilities. The solution involves using a combination of pulse-echo data and through-transmission data. Fujitsu\u2019s AI models were trained to locate and characterize discrete and non-discrete defects directly from raw ultrasound data. GKN Aerospace expects the new AI platform to speed up throughput times by up to 50%, meaning it can produce more components within the same period, and operators' productivity is increased. It also lays the foundation for greater manufacturing insights and more intelligent decision-making.The unprecedented third simultaneously nominated case study saw Fujitsu transform the Rice Exchange \u2013 the first digital platform designed to buy and sell rice using blockchain. The rice market, the world\u2019s largest agricultural commodity market, is plagued by inefficiencies. The Fujitsu-designed and deployed marketplace features an integrated supply chain solution using blockchain to offer security, transparency, efficiency, traceability to the rice market. The use of a private permissioned blockchain removes frictions and delays in the supply chain, ensuring security and transparency in international rice trades by allowing all stakeholders to see the same verifiable data in real-time. Currently, more than 300 organizations use the marketplace. Trade costs have been reduced by more than 20%, and 90% of trades are completed in less than six minutes, compared to the multiple weeks that transactions previously took to complete.\u201cThe events of the past year have accelerated the adoption of digital technologies and business models,\u201d said Paul Reynolds, ISG partner and chief research officer. \u201cEnhancing customer and user experience was the most prevalent objective across the enterprise-provider projects we examined, and the transformational role providers are playing was evidenced by the many innovative and impactful solutions they delivered.\u201d\n\nDownloadsISG Digital Case Study: Aioi Nissay DowaISG Digital Case Study: GKN AerospaceISG Digital Case Study: Rice ExchangeOnline resourcesRead the Fujitsu blog: https:\/\/blog.global.fujitsu.com\/Follow Fujitsu on Twitter: http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/Fujitsu_GlobalFollow us on LinkedIn: http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/fujitsuFind Fujitsu on Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/FujitsuICTFujitsu pictures and media server: http:\/\/mediaportal.ts.fujitsu.com\/pages\/portal.phpFor regular news updates, bookmark the Fujitsu newsroom: https:\/\/www.fujitsu.com\/emeia\/about\/resources\/news\/newsroom.html\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Fujitsu\r\n\r\n\r\nFujitsu is the leading Japanese information and communication technology (ICT) company offering a full range of technology products, solutions and services.

Sales will commence for the Japanese market today, June 30, with availability in international regions at a later date.The latest version offers enhanced functions, including a feature that allows users to create a 3D bill of process (3D-BOP) (2) that links 3D data to production process information for production preparation activities such as manufacturing prototyping and process planning. Specifically, the new version includes an improved function for visualizing machine layout and work procedures in a process block diagram (3) in an easy-to-understand manner illustrated with graphics and image inserts, as well as an enhanced function to centralize work data for parts with common specifications in manufacturing lines that handle products with multiple specifications. This makes it possible to quickly create a highly accurate 3D-BOP that can reduce manufacturing errors and the need to redo common tasks. With this tool, Fujitsu can bring the real world of manufacturing closer to the digital world, helping to deliver products to market faster and improve overall productivity and quality.Fujitsu\u2019s VPS offering will accelerate DX in the manufacturing space by linking digital data from design to manufacturing sites and supports working styles at manufacturing sites for the \u201cnew normal,\u201d streamlining work processes and promoting the ability to manage operations remotely. Fujitsu will also contribute to the achievement of the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) by improving productivity and quality and creating innovations from a variety of perspectives.BackgroundThe SDGs Action Plan 2021 (4) announced by the Japanese government in December 2020, identifies the \"promotion of digital transformation, and establishment of a system where everyone can benefit from digitization, and work to establish and accelerate the 'new normal\u2019 as a priority issue. At manufacturing sites, DX is expected to link the entire process from design to manufacturing with digital data, and to improve efficiency and productivity by centralizing data, contributing to the fulfillment of this objective.In the manufacturing industry, COVID-19 is causing demand for new ways of working at manufacturing sites. Simultaneously, it is becoming increasingly difficult for manufacturers to direct assembly operations, which have been conducted at overseas plants. These factors have led to a growing demand for 3D-BOP solutions that can effectively visualize manufacturing sites.To address this need, Fujitsu has launched a new version of its VPS with enhanced functions for creating a visually appealing 3D-BOPs and streamlining operations on manufacturing lines.Features of the New Version1. VPS Standard and VPS Manufacturing, 3D-BOP creation tools that more faithfully represent the manufacturing siteVPS Standard and VPS Manufacturing are 3D-BOP creation tools for reviewing the manufacturing process with 3D data. With previous versions of this solution, process procedure were represented by process names and parts images that can be assembled in processes, but they were insufficient for intuitive understanding of process layout, work procedures, and way of assembling.The new version enables the creation of a more visual 3D-BOP solution that is suitable for the manufacturing site by means of graphics and insert images to indicate the arrangement of machines, worker flow lines, and work procedures on the process block diagram, displaying tools on snapshots and process shots (5), and easily creating shapes such as weld shapes, auxiliary materials, and jigs and tools. This reduces operational errors such as misuse of jigs and assembly work order, resulting in higher yield production.2. VPS GP4, a manufacturing line process planning tool that improves work efficiency by centralizing dataWith the previous versions of the VPS GP4 solution, which is used for examining the process plan of a manufacturing line with 3D data, it was necessary to create and edit design data on an individual basis, including for shared tasks. With this enhancement, it will be possible to mix common work and work with different specifications and express them in one data. As a result, when there is a change in a common operation, only one set of data needs to be corrected. This can reduce the operation time by up to about 70% (6). Moreover, since multiple operational procedures are represented by one set of data, it is easier to compare and examine each procedure. Thus, it is possible to apply reasonable improvement measures while looking at evaluation values of production lines.Future PlansGoing forward, Fujitsu will continue to support Digital Transformation (DX) in the manufacturing industry, leveraging its capabilities as a leading technology company with extensive know-how in manufacturing and advanced technologies in fulfillment of its mission for its manufacturing brand, COLMINA: \"Bringing innovation to manufacturing through the delivery of services that are global, open, and rapid that help to realize DX\"Pricing and Availability for Fujitsu Manufacturing Industry Solution VPS V15L23 (7)Product NameSelling Price (tax excl.)AvailabilityVPS Standard V15L23 (8)JPY 4 millionJune 30, 2021VPS Digital Mockup V15L23JPY 2.5 millionVPS Manufacturing V15L23 (9)JPY 2.5 millionVPS GP4 V11L23JPY 4.4 millionSales Target1,000 licenses by the end of fiscal 2021 (Fujitsu\u2019s fiscal year ends at the end of March.).[1]Fujitsu Manufacturing Industry Solution COLMINA Digital Production Preparation VPS:\nPlease note that outside the Japanese market the product is officially referred to as Fujitsu Manufacturing Industry Solution COLMINA Digital Manufacturing FJVPS.[2]3D Bill of Process:\nProduction preparation information that links data such as parts, work procedures, locations, equipment and tools, and manufacturing know-how used in product assembly with 3D data.[3]Process block diagram:\nA diagram that shows the relationship of the entire process and the flow of assembly work, including the positional relationship of workplaces.[4]SDGs Action Plan 2021:\nThe Japanese government's Headquarters for the Promotion of SDGs compiled specific measures for the promotion of SDGs in 2021.[5]Snapshot or process shot:\nA graphic representation of a scene of a manufacturing operation or process used as an illustration in a work instruction or process plan.[6]Reduce the operation time by up to about 70%:\nConfirmed by our sample model with 3 to 6 specification variations.[7]Selling Price:\nNetwork license price.

The availability of these kinds of commercial applications used as is on supercomputers like Fugaku and Fujitsu\u2019s PRIMEHPC series, which boast large-scale, high-speed computing capabilities, could offer many potential benefits by allowing companies to continue using already-familiar applications and make use of their industry and process-specific expertise.To expedite the availability of these kinds of commercial applications, Fujitsu has provided a number of application vendors with development environments and testing environments for the PRIMEHPC series, working alongside these vendors. In large-scale simulations, Fujitsu analyzed the performance of commercial applications, did performance tuning to eliminate bottlenecks and applied parallel processing technology so that they could run efficiently with highly parallel processing. As a result, Fujitsu has successfully verified the operation of eight commercial applications. Fugaku was used for three of these applications to obtain high-speed, high-definition simulation results for large-scale analysis.Verification and results of large-scale analysis using commercial applicationsIn collaboration with various vendors, Fujitsu conducted a large-scale, high definition simulation for improving the energy efficiency and safety of aircraft and automobiles, which represents an increasingly important priority from the viewpoint of reducing environmental impact making use of commercial applications that have been tested for the PRIMEHPC series. Using the computing resources of Fugaku (2), Fujitsu conducted simulations with highly parallel processing, validating the feasibility of performing analyses within the amount of time required by companies for practical application in the real-world.1. Improvement of aircraft safetyDuring flight, an aircraft may experience a vibration phenomenon called buffet, which affects its safety and flight stability. Predicting buffet vibration is an important issue for aircraft safety design. This time, by executing the thermal fluid analysis application Cradle CFD | scFLOW (3) in parallel using the maximum possible 192,000 out of Fugaku\u2019s total number of CPU cores (4) of Fugaku and analyzing a high-definition model of 237 million elements with LES (5), which is an analysis method capable of expressing fine vortexes, it was possible to observe a phenomenon whereby pressure vibration and fine vortexes are generated on the surface of the blade. This makes it possible to predict the buffet effect in greater detail than the conventional RANS (6) analysis method using a coarse calculation grid. This proved that large-scale analyses leading to the safe design of aircraft taking into account the buffet could be calculated.Thermal fluid analysis for aircraft wing surface turbulence2. Improvement of energy efficiency of automobile enginesImproving the energy efficiency of engines is an important issue for improving the fuel efficiency and environmental performance of automobiles. A combustion analysis that takes into account a series of chemical reactions, such as combustion inside a cylinder caused by piston action in the engine, was performed in two hours with parallel calculation using the thermal fluid analysis application CONVERGE (7) using up to 4,620 CPU cores of Fugaku\u2019s cores. In this analysis, the entire region was divided by a high-precision calculation grid (up to 6.67 million grids) of 0.5 mm units, and the use of LES made it possible to successfully obtain high-precision results showing a wrinkled flame structure, which would prove difficult with conventional RANS analysis. As a result, highly accurate analysis can be performed even during the limited time required for design work in the manufacturing industry, which is expected to lead to improvements in engine energy efficiency and reductions in abnormal combustion.Results of thermal fluid analysis in the engine cylinder3. Reduction of energy loss in driving motors for electric vehiclesTo improve the energy efficiency of electric and hybrid vehicles, it is necessary to reduce energy loss in the driving motor. One of the methods to calculate the loss generated by IPM motors (8) used in electric vehicles, etc., with high accuracy is to model the steel sheet of the iron core constituting the motor one by one, and to use the method to input the current containing harmonics. Conventional x86 clusters require several weeks to complete the calculation, but using Fugaku's 8,192 CPU cores and running them in parallel in the electromagnetic field analysis application JMAG (9), it can be done in a day (10). As a result, it is expected that analysis leading to improved energy efficiency in electric vehicles can be performed in a shorter time.Commercial applications to be verified operations on Fugaku and PRIMEHPC FX1000By providing vendors with development environments and technical support for Fugaku and PRIMEHPC FX1000, Fujitsu and application vendors have collaborated to newly validate operations for eight commercial applications, beginning with the structural analysis application LS-DYNA from Ansys (11), which is widely used in the manufacturing industry to improve collision safety for automobiles.

The research will leverage Fugaku to identify small molecule inhibitory compounds that can be used as potential drugs in treatments for COVID-19 as well as clarifying the molecular mechanism by which COVID-19 infections are inhibited, leading to the eventual development of small molecule therapeutic drugs. Full scale research begins on June 22nd, 2021 and will continue until March of 2022.In their joint research, Fujitsu and RCAST will leverage IT drug discovery technology with a focus on inhibitory compound creation technology and molecular simulation technology that precisely represents the state of molecules, performing calculations on Fugaku to identify inhibitory compounds based on the dynamic behavior of viral proteins and to predict the properties of future mutations. By utilizing Fugaku, molecular simulations for viral proteins and inhibitory compounds formulation can be accelerated, clarifying the complexity of binding states and interactions between viral proteins and inhibitory compounds, with the aim of identifying inhibitory compounds that can lead to therapeutic drugs at an early stage.Going forward, Fujitsu will continue harnessing the power of supercomputers and molecular simulation technologies as it strives to quickly deliver on the promise of potential therapies for COVID-19 with its joint research alongside RCAST Project Associate Professor Yamashita, contributing to the realization of a society in which all people can live with peace of mind.BackgroundSince 2011, Fujitsu has been engaged in joint research with RCAST on IT drug discovery technologies to create candidate small molecule compounds for anticancer drugs and other therapies. While a number of highly effective vaccines have been successfully developed in response to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the development of effective therapeutic drugs remains an important priority. Based on the fruits of their joint research to date in the field of IT drug discovery technology, Fujitsu and RCAST have decided to embark on a new intensive research project to identify inhibitory compounds that will lead to the development of new coronavirus drugs, leveraging the unparalleled computing power of Fugaku to contribute to this goal.Overview of the Joint ResearchSince 2011, Fujitsu and RCAST have been conducting joint research on small molecule drugs that are highly likely to be taken orally, are chemically synthesizable, and have low production costs compared to drugs in forms of peptide drugs, antibody drugs, nucleic acid drugs, and cell drugs. With the goal of identifying inhibitory compounds that lead to develop new coronavirus drugs that are effective in small doses and reduce the risk of side effects, molecular simulation technology that is the result of the joint research will be utilized. As it is vital to create a molecular structure that can bind strongly to the viral protein and control its activity, molecular simulation technology and Fugaku will be widely used for tasks including the creation of three-dimensional structural models, clarifying the molecular mechanisms of infection inhibition, and predicting the properties of mutant strains.(1) Clarification of the molecular mechanism of infection inhibition leading to the development of therapeutic drugsProduce a three-dimensional structure model of viral protein and candidate compound for an infection-inhibiting molecular structure\nAfter searching for candidate regions where molecules can bind to viral proteins derived from a coronavirus, for each candidate region, docking simulation (1)is used to search for the positions and orientations of inhibitory compounds. The candidate state in which the viral proteins and inhibitory compounds bind is derived to generate a three-dimensional structural model.Fig.1 Docking simulation of viral protein and inhibitory compoundTrack dynamic behavior of viral protein and inhibitory molecular compound based on generated three-dimensional structure model, verify effect in the body\nIn order to confirm that a viral protein and an inhibitory compound can exist stably in a state where they are bound even in an environment close to physiological conditions in the body, their dynamic behavior in a three-dimensional structure model is evaluated with a molecular dynamics simulation (2). Based on the microscopic images at the molecular level obtained from these simulations, the molecular mechanism of infection inhibition will be clarified with academic advice from RCAST Project Associate Professor Yamashita, and knowledge on the interaction between viral proteins and inhibitory compounds will be obtained.\n\nBased on the findings obtained here, Fujitsu will identify information that offering the potential for improvements in the molecular structure of drugs and optimizing molecular structure in order to rapidly develop new small molecule drugs.Fig. 2 Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Viral Proteins and Inhibitory Compounds(2) Running simulations to predict behavior and properties of mutant strains in order to make effective therapeutics for future viral mutationsProperty prediction of mutations will be carried out with the aim of establishing a process that can quickly lead to the development of a specific drug for mutant strains of the virus by predicting their properties, including for new types of coronaviruses, using simulations.\n\nBy mutating the amino acid sequence of a viral protein and simulating its behavior with Fugaku, it becomes possible to predict how mutations can affect the structure and function of viral proteins, as well as the manner in which they might interact with inhibitory compounds.Fig. 3 Property prediction of mutant strains[1]Docking Simulation:\nTechnique for predicting the structure of a complex of a protein and a small molecule that may bind to it.[2]Molecular Dynamics Simulation:\nTechnology that calculates the amount of energy and changes in the shape of a substance by calculating the forces between atoms that make up a molecule over time.

Ricoh has started full-scale operations of the system in June 2021 at its Numazu Plant, which manufactures polymerized toner (1).The new system leverages Fujitsu\u2019s plant visualization solution, FUJITSU Manufacturing Industry Solution COLMINA Intelligent Dashboard (2), to collect and process production information from Ricoh\u2019s chemical plant in Numazu, Japan, offering a comprehensive view of the entire plant\u2019s production status in real-time. Connecting the system with smartphones, tablets, and other devices makes it possible to visualize the status of plant operations and changes in product quality anytime and anywhere, empowering management with the ability to remotely manage factories and quickly intervene to prevent potential disruptions to smooth operations, including facility anomalies and quality defects.Going forward, Fujitsu will play an active role in supporting Ricoh\u2019s plans to expand the system to other locations and will continue to support digital transformation (DX) initiatives at its various production sites.BackgroundRicoh\u2019s Numazu Office serves as its base for research, development, and production of chemical products. The office carries out R&D and production of image forming supplies such as polymerized toner and ink, thermal products (3), and new business development for areas including next-generation solar cells and new materials. At the chemical plant, a large-scale facility producing polymerized toner, products flow through tanks, pipes, and processing equipment and the condition of the products cannot be confirmed from the outside. Instead, product condition is determined through information from facility sensors and sampling inspections. To enable a small number of on-site workers to safely manage and respond to information drawn from a massive number of facility sensors, it\u2019s imperative to provide operation status reports from the plant quickly and intuitively to field workers to ensure safe operations and quality assurance. With COVID-19 preventing site managers from visiting sites at times, Ricoh has also been exploring new working styles for the \u201cNew Normal\u201d.Under these circumstances, Ricoh and Fujitsu embarked on the joint development and deployment of a system for visualizing the entire plant's production status in September 2020, which supports speedy and safe remote plant management, guided by the chemical plant\u2019s theme of \u201cHelping People Work Smarter\u201dOverview of the Factory-Wide Production Status Visualization SystemThe new system realizes quick and intuitive management of the safety and quality status of the chemical plant in near real-time using Fujitsu\u2019s factory visualization solution, COLMINA Intelligent Dashboard, processing, accumulating, and visualizing data for indicators to be managed, including operation information and logs, drawing from an enormous amount of data from sensors and production equipment in the plant.By connecting the system with smartphones and tablets, it is possible to visualize the operation status and changes in product quality at the factory anytime and anywhere even when the site manager cannot physically visit the production site. The system allows managers to work remotely to respond quickly to prevent disruptions to production and quality defects by making data-driven decisions and giving effective instructions to workers in the field.System OverviewFuture PlansRicoh's Numazu Plant will focus on higher-value-added operations by utilizing the factory-wide production status visualization system to reduce the administrative burden on site managers and workers.

As well as enabling more fans to return to arenas, the technology results in substantially increased revenue for major sports clubs and promotors of other arena events.\n\nFujitsu\u2019s solution is currently under evaluation by clubs in the Bundesliga \u2013 Germany\u2019s top-tier soccer league, with several Bundesliga football clubs keen to take advantage of it. Fujitsu\u2019s modeling for the Berlin Olympic Stadium shows that the Digital Annealer can increase the number of seats in use while complying with social distancing guidelines by 60%, resulting more income per game day through ticket sales alone. The world-famous N\u00fcrburgring race track is convinced of how efficiently the system can work, following tests during the 24h race and Formula1. The N\u00fcrburgring, where different regulations apply, expects to accommodate up to 30% more spectators using the Fujitsu Digital Annealer.Mirco Markfort, CEO at N\u00fcrburgring, says: \"Tests with the Digital Annealer technology showed that we could have achieved 30-40% higher occupancy per grandstand at test events under the same Corona specifications in comparison to the real booking behaviour. This is impressive and showed us how the Digital Annealer can perform. We can very well imagine using this technology in the future, provided it can be linked to our ticketing system.\u201d\nSource: Nuerburgring\/Robert Kah \u2013 imagetrustFans typically buy tickets in blocks of various sizes according to the number of friends or family taking part. However, until now, Covid-safe seating plans have been forced to assume a more rigid layout. Typically, pairs of seats are separated with a \u2018buffer\u2019 of empty places to maintain safe social distancing. This pattern has to be maintained, regardless of whether purchasers want to sit in pairs or not.\n\nFujitsu\u2019s Digital Annealer enables seating plans that maximize compliant admission regulationsWith the Digital Annealer, event promotors can now rapidly calculate seating plans that are flexible to fans\u2019 precise needs and in line with local social distancing requirements, rather than a standard seating pattern-based purely on pairs. This highly complex calculation takes too long on conventional computers to be practical for online ticket sales. However, the Digital Annealer captures quantum computers\u2019 extraordinary ability to resolve so-called \u2018combinatorial optimization\u2019 calculations \u2013 selecting the best possible outcome from a vast array of choices.Joern Nitschmann, Head of Manufacturing and Automotive at Fujitsu Central Europe, comments: \u201cWhen sports and other major events come back into our lives, social distancing is still going to be a major requirement, limiting the number of tickets available. The optimization calculation facing event organizers is so complex that conventional computers cannot produce optimal solutions quickly enough to allow promotors to take advantage. The great news for fans and promoters alike is that Fujitsu\u2019s QIOS solution ensures the correct social distancing for Covid safety and therefore allows more people into the events they have been missing so much.\u201d\n\nNotes to editors* The exact percentage varies according to local distancing requirements.\n\nOnline resourcesWatch Technologies against the pandemic,\u00a0keynote address by Dr Joseph Reger, Fujitsu Fellow, CTO Fujitsu Central and Eastern Europe, at Fujitsu Activate NowRead the Fujitsu blog: https:\/\/blog.global.fujitsu.com\/Follow Fujitsu on Twitter: http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/Fujitsu_GlobalFollow us on LinkedIn: http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/fujitsuFind Fujitsu on Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/FujitsuICTFujitsu pictures and media server: http:\/\/mediaportal.ts.fujitsu.com\/pages\/portal.phpFor regular news updates, bookmark the Fujitsu newsroom: https:\/\/www.fujitsu.com\/emeia\/about\/resources\/news\/newsroom.html\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Fujitsu\r\n\r\n\r\nFujitsu is the leading Japanese information and communication technology (ICT) company offering a full range of technology products, solutions and services.

The proof of concept, conducted in collaboration with the project team including tier one network operators, demonstrates end-to-end service operations and network visibility across multi-vendor optical networks.Fujitsu contributed the Virtuora\u00ae Network Controller (NC) to enable multi-vendor SDN control across a partially disaggregated Open Line System (OLS), helping to define real-world operator use cases to accelerate adoption of open converged and packet optical networks. The controller supports both a standard T-API interface for the ROADM network as well as an OpenConfig interface for the transponders.\nFigure 1: TIP CANDI proof of concept open optical architecture. Fujitsu provided the Virtuora\u00ae Network Controller and 1FINITY\u2122 T600s for this proof of concept.\n\nThe proof of concept is the first integration of a commercial SDN controller based on the OpenDaylight platform, along with GNPy, the only vendor-neutral, open-source optical planning tool for optical reach verification. Virtuora NC supports both OLS domain control and optical SDN control, leveraging OpenDaylight to deliver a blend of openness and out-of-the-box capabilities for optical network design, installation, service creation, assurance and maintenance.The proof of concept demonstrates how flexible, modular optical hardware products and software control solutions based on open-source platforms provide a unique offering that achieves immediate needs for new network infrastructure, while positioning the network itself for migration to open networking in phases. This inherent flexibility allows CSPs to deploy an optical architecture today and achieve an open network architecture tomorrow.\u201cThe open optical control project is a major milestone toward enabling operators to achieve greater vendor diversity and efficiencies in their optical networks,\u201d said Francois Lafontaine, vice president and head of the software business at Fujitsu Network Communications, Inc. \u201cThis proof of concept clearly validates the capabilities of Virtuora NC as a true multi-vendor SDN controller.\u201dTo view the TIP CANDI PoC, visit the virtual Demo Zone during the virtual Optical Networking and Communications Conference and Exhibition, June 7 \u2013 11, 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Fujitsu\r\n\r\n\r\nFujitsu is the leading Japanese information and communication technology (ICT) company offering a full range of technology products, solutions and services.

Fujitsu will offer the new platform, the \"Fujitsu Future Mobility Accelerator Digital Twin Collector,\" to automobile manufacturers and insurance companies in the Japanese market from April 22, with availability to follow in North America and Europe from June 2021, contributing to the realization of new mobility services on a global scale.As a wide-area distributed data access technology optimized for mobility, the Digital Twin Collector delivers stable communications by regulating the volume of data sent from the mobility device to the cloud with the Traffic Scheduler Function, while the Data Coverage Control Function enables comprehensive data collection without duplication. These functions make it possible to reproduce and process large volumes of data from mobility devices on the cloud platform as needed, significantly reducing costs for the management and transmission of large amounts of vehicle and traffic data.With the development of this platform, Fujitsu demonstrates its ongoing contributions to the realization of automated driving systems, including the creation of high-precision maps used by automobile manufacturers, etc., as well as offering detailed data on driving conditions including congestion, obstacles, and weather to vehicles on the road by road management companies.BackgroundIn recent years, the world has faced growing demand for innovative solutions to the challenges posed by exponential increases in data generated by connected vehicles and the digital transformation of transportation through new mobility technologies. To address this, Fujitsu has developed and launched its stream data processing platform, \"Digital Twin Utilizer,\" as well as an in-vehicle camera image analysis platform, \"Digital Twin Analyzer.\"The introduction of Fujitsu\u2019s new \u201cDigital Twin Collector\u201d, which greatly reduces the cost of data collection and storage by virtually integrating and managing the data held by mobility devices, represents the latest development in this ongoing effort to streamline the use of big data with digital twin technology.Digital Twin Collector Overview1. Distributed management of data held by mobility devices reduces data collection and storage costsThe platform virtually integrates distributed data by managing only lightweight metadata (1), rather than storing large amounts of data such as video recorded by mobility devices in the cloud. This allows users, including car manufacturers and insurance companies, to access only the data they need, significantly reducing the amount of data and traffic in the cloud, delivering cost savings of 50% (2).2. Traffic Scheduler Function provides stable data access by regulating congestion of large-volume data communications.When it is necessary to collect video data simultaneously from one\u2019s own vehicle and surrounding vehicles due to an accident, etc., the burden on the cloud side increases rapidly and congestion occurs as data is accessed and copied from each device. This may disrupt the flow of data or reduce data accessibility. The new Traffic Scheduler Function regulates bulk traffic by controlling data replication requests from mobility devices. This provides stable data access.3. Data Coverage Control Function delivers consistent service quality by keeping data duplication under control and performing comprehensive replicationBiases introduced at the time training data is collected for self-driving systems may impact service quality. The Data Coverage Control function performs a cross-sectional analysis of the data access and acquisition status for a large number of mobility devices, thereby contributing both to the prevention of duplication of similar data, such as video data with the same time, location, and viewing angle, and the completeness of the acquired data. This helps to ensure service quality for the data being used for analysis as well as the service itself.Digital Twin CollectorUse CaseImproving the efficiency and sophistication of insurance operations\n\nWhen an accident is detected, simply by specifying the location and time of the accident, a video from before and after the accident can be automatically obtained for the vehicle and surrounding vehicles. This allows insurance companies to provide automotive insurance service that handles accidents in a way that takes into account multiple perspectives.Upgrading road management services\n\nBased on vehicle behavior, the system can capture images in real time related to traffic congestion, accidents, falling obstacles, bad weather, and other events occurring on the road, enabling the road management company to provide detailed traffic control services in a timely manner.Vehicle failure analysis\n\nBy collecting peripheral images when abnormal values are detected by vehicle sensors, automobile manufacturers can use them to estimate the cause of failure and provide feedback for vehicle development.Service OverviewIn addition to the basic service that virtually integrates and manages data distributed on mobility devices, Fujitsu will offer several types of services, including a requirement definition support service that organizes requirements according to customer needs, setup service that creates usage environments, support service and customization service at individual quotation basis.Related LinksFujitsu Expands Potential of Automotive Big Data with Launch of AI-Powered, On-Vehicle Camera Video Analysis Platform, \"Fujitsu Future Mobility Accelerator Digital Twin Analyzer\"Fujitsu Launches New Stream Data Processing Platform to Accelerate Use of Automotive Big Data[1]Metadata:\nAdditional information related to the data, including basic information such as who created the data, where it was created, when it was created, how to access the data, and information describing the contents of the data.[2]delivering cost savings of 50%:\nComparison with the case where all data is aggregated and accumulated on a cloud platform.About FujitsuFujitsu is the leading Japanese information and communication technology (ICT) company offering a full range of technology products, solutions and services.

The systems successfully integrated onto the platform since its inception include the JMA\u2019s regional meteorological observation system, \"AMeDAS\" (1), weather information transmission system, \"ADESS\" (2), and Ocean Information Processing System (3). The JMA initiated operations of the new platform system in March 2021.By shifting key systems to the platform, the JMA plans to reduce operational load and costs and improve the speed of system development, while further strengthening its meteorological services by accelerating the use of data for disaster prevention and mitigation, and improving the accuracy of weather forecasts.Fujitsu\u2019s central role in the digital transformation of the JMA\u2019s systems represents an important contribution to the accurate and rapid provision of vital meteorological and disaster prevention information, and ultimately the realization of a safer, more sustainable society.BackgroundThe Japan Meteorological Agency not only collects and analyzes observational data on weather, but also earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, and oceans from meteorological organizations both domestically and internationally. The JMA leverages this data to offer important disaster prevention and weather information to the media, the public, and disaster prevention organizations allowing it to contribute to areas like traffic safety and to disaster mitigation measures.In addition to the AMeDAS, ADESS, and Ocean Information Processing System built by Fujitsu, the JMA has established systems for individual operations. In anticipation of possible large-scale disasters, the JMA has divided and operated its systems between two stations in the East and West of Japan (4). With the growing sophistication of the technology and data-collection capabilities, however, the JMA has faced issues including increased operating costs, more complex operational management, longer development periods for new systems, and delays in adapting to the latest technologies.To help address these challenges, the JMA introduced the central Information System Infrastructure in March 2020 to consolidate and integrate the various business systems that Fujitsu has built onto a virtualized platform. Since October 2020, each business system has been gradually shifted onto this platform, and with the completion of work to shift the three large scale systems, operations of the platform have commenced.System Overview and Benefits of MigrationThe JMA Information System Infrastructure makes it possible to integrate the operation and management system of individual systems, reduce costs, implement upgrades, and standardize security criteria to stably deliver 24 hour, non-stop operations. Because the systems are operated on the same platform, the development period for new functions and systems can be shortened considerably, and individual systems can be easily linked with others to accelerate data utilization.1. AMeDASAMeDAS automatically receives meteorological observation data such as precipitation, wind direction and wind speed, temperature, and relative humidity at least every minute from about 1,300 AMeDAS stations nationwide including Meteorological Offices and Weather Stations, and uses the processed meteorological observation data for issuing disaster prevention meteorological information. Shifting AMeDAS to the new platform makes it possible to flexibly add system resources in response to the increase in the amount of weather observation data due to the localization and severity of disasters in recent years, contributing to the prompt and accurate announcement of disaster prevention weather information to stakeholders throughout society.2. ADESSADESS is a system that plays a central role in the network that exchanges data with meteorological institutions in Japan and internationally, and distributes disaster prevention weather information including a variety of forecasts, advisories, warnings, and seismic intensity bulletins created by the JMA to administrative agencies and media organizations domestically. Shifting ADESS to the new platform will greatly improve the system\u2019s data processing capacity, which is needed to increase the amount of weather observation data it can collect from AMeDAS, the tide level data general processing system, weather satellites, etc., and to improve the computing capacity of supercomputer systems, enabling accurate and flexible delivery of updated weather information.3. Ocean Information Processing SystemThe Ocean Information Processing System collects and processes observed data, distributes real-time information on storm surges and tsunamis, and exchanges data with external organizations. Shifting the system to the new platform will contribute to the safe and real-time delivery of data essential for generating warnings and advisories of high tides that accompany earthquakes, tsunamis, and typhoons.\"JMA Information System Infrastructure\" and image of system overview[1]JMA\u2019s regional meteorological observation system, \"AMeDAS\":\nAutomated Meteorological Data Acquisition System.

With the technical support of Siemens, Fujitsu is additionally developing 3D-BOP (3) functions that seamlessly link design and assembly processes to shorten time to market and improve productivity and quality.Going forward, Fujitsu will begin offering 3D-BOP functions to the Japanese market in July 2021. Based on the results achieved in the initial roll-out in Japan, Fujitsu will strengthen its global service provision and maintenance structure, and in April 2022, plans to expand service offering to Europe, North America, and Asia.Facing increasingly fierce global competition in the manufacturing industry, many companies feel growing pressure to streamline operations, boost competitiveness, and find ways to contribute to international sustainability initiatives like the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To this end, many have proactively promoted the use of digital technologies. In many cases, however, data used in individual processes like design, production engineering, and manufacturing is still managed separately, and because systems aren\u2019t interconnected this data isn\u2019t fully utilized. This in turn hinders progress toward more sustainable, efficient practices in manufacturing. To overcome these challenges and realize smart manufacturing that takes sustainability into account while remaining resistant to changes in the global business environment, companies must build the capacity to quickly introduce integrated solutions that seamlessly link planning, design, production preparation, and production processes.Through this collaboration, Fujitsu aims to build the global capabilities needed to respond quickly to market changes and to support its customers\u2019 competitiveness in the manufacturing industry, as well as contribute to the fulfillment of the SDGs through the acceleration of DX initiatives. Fujitsu aims to achieve this by seamlessly linking manufacturing information that is managed individually at each site and process on a global basis, using Siemens \u2019 globally recognized solutions for the manufacturing industry. Fujitsu will also leverage the know-how and expertise it has cultivated over its years of business development and problem-solving in the manufacturing space and its track record in implementing CPS (Cyber Physical System) (4), which represents a combination of physical and computational elements in the manufacturing area.Fujitsu will continue to support Digital Transformation (DX) in the manufacturing industry in fulfillment of its mission for its manufacturing brand, COLMINA: \"Bringing innovation to manufacturing through the delivery of services that are global, open, and rapid that help to realize DX.\" Fujitsu's commitment to this mission for its COLMINA business brand will ultimately allow for the creation of new value, enhance competitiveness in the manufacturing industry, and support the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for the entire society.[1]Teamcenter\uff1a\nSiemens PLM system that enables centralized management of product information through product planning, design and production preparation phases.[2]Opcenter\uff1a\nSiemens' MES solution that digitizes quality control, planning and scheduling, operations, and visualizes manufacturing processes.[3]3D-BOP\uff1a\nA function of managing shape data in association with design information, assembly information, manufacturing record information, etc., to facilitate data linkage between the design process and the manufacturing process.[4]CPS\uff08Cyber Physical System\uff09\uff1a\nData collected in the physical (real) domain is analyzed and verified in the cyber (virtual) domain, and the results are reflected in physical domain to interact with each other to solve problems.About FujitsuFujitsu is the leading Japanese information and communication technology (ICT) company offering a full range of technology products, solutions and services.

The technology leverages an AI model trained on images of products with simulated abnormalities, without having to prepare training data that uses actual images of defective products pulled from the inspection process of a production line.This technology is capable of correctly detecting abnormalities like frayed threads and defective wiring patterns in products that vary individually, even if they appear normal, such as carpets with different wool or color, or printed circuit boards with different wiring shapes depending on the part. The developed technology successfully achieved world leading accuracy (1) in a benchmark using public data (2) collected from external images of various manufactured goods.Fujitsu verified the effectiveness of this technology during the inspection process at the Nagano Plant of Fujitsu Interconnect Technologies Limited, a factory that manufactures electronic equipment, and confirmed its effectiveness in reducing man-hours required for inspecting printed circuit boards by 25%. The technology ultimately offers the potential to help reduce the workload of workers at manufacturing plants and improve productivity, while helping to introduce new working styles for frontline staff.Background & ChallengesAt the site of the inspection process, the inspector determines whether the product is defective based on features such as its approximate shape, detailed structure, and texture. For example, approximate shape is considered important in a shape distortion test, and texture is considered important in a condition or pattern test. Furthermore, even if the product appears normal, if there are individual variations in elements like coating, color, and wiring shape, these characteristics are examined for each item, and the inspection is conducted while distinguishing whether individual differences or abnormalities fall within the acceptable range. Therefore, when training AI to conduct quality control tasks, it is necessary to be able to capture a wide variety of features that occur on an individual basis in a normal image. However, the typical method of training an AI model using weighted and summed indices for each characteristic has led to a tendency to focus on only one characteristic, and it has proven difficult to create a model that fully grasps all the characteristics.About the Newly Developed TechnologyWith this technology, the AI restores the normal image from which the abnormality has been removed when an abnormality is detected, and detects the abnormal part by capturing the difference between the image to be inspected and the restored normal image. Fujitsu has developed a method to train an AI model so that a normal image without a variety of anomalies such as shape, size, and color can be restored by artificially adding the simulated abnormalities to a normal image prepared for training. The improved ability to restore normal images has made it possible to detect abnormal areas with high accuracy without preparing images containing abnormalities as training data. During training, Fujitsu compares the normal image with the image restored by AI, evaluates the degree of training of each feature such as approximate shape, detailed structure, and texture, and control the size, color, and number of abnormalities to be added so that AI preferentially learns features not captured. For example, if the AI is not able to correctly restore the approximate shape, it trains with abnormal images with a few small abnormalities that do not affect the normal appearance. Also, if the details and texture are slightly different, the AI trains with many abnormal images that are large enough to obscure the details or add a conspicuous pattern. In this way, by evaluating the state of AI restoration and training on weak areas where AI cannot restore features, it became possible to restore normal images that captured all features.In addition, Fujitsu has developed a new technology that generates materials of various shapes, sizes, and colors from a library of images of more than 5000 kinds of artificial objects, and adds abnormalities by probabilistically changing the number of abnormalities and the position to which they are added.Fig 1. Outline of the development technologyOutcomesThe developed technology achieved world leading accuracy, with an AUROC (3) score exceeding 98% in a class of products that have variations in their normal appearance, such as carpets with different fur patterns and colors on an individual basis and printed circuit boards with different wiring shapes on different parts. In addition, there is no variation in individual products such as screws and nuts, and in products where non-defective products have a uniform appearance, accuracy equivalent to that of conventional technologies (4) was also successfully maintained.The real-world effectiveness of this technology was verified during the inspection process at the Nagano Plant of Fujitsu Interconnect Technologies, a manufacturer of electronic equipment. The technology succeeded in reducing man-hours required for inspecting printed circuit boards by 25%.Fig 2. Comparison with the prior artFuture PlansIn the future, Fujitsu will further develop this and other related technologies to support Fujitsu\u2019s portfolio of AI technologies, \"FUJITSU Human Centric AI Zinrai,\" and aims to apply this new approach to Fujitsu\u2019s manufacturing brand \"COLMINA,\" which delivers digital transformation (DX) for the manufacturing industry.[1]world leading accuracy:\nThe accuracy was achieved for AUROC in comparison with the technologies listed in the benchmark ranking of anomaly detection technology using MVTec AD in the target class with variations in normal appearance.

This explanation offers a useful reference to doctors who are considering a treatment plan or genomic medical researchers. The system draws from the \"Integrated Database of Clinical and Genomic Information program (2), managed by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development , and from April 2021, Kyoto University plans to offer MGeND Intelligence to joint researchers and institutions.In addition to the pathogenicity estimation AI, the MGeND Intelligence verification system includes explainable AI that shows the basis of the system\u2019s findings, as well as literature search AI that supports the retrieval of related articles. Working with the Integrated Database of Clinical and Genomic Information, \"MGeND,\" which was made public by Kyoto University in 2018, Fujitsu supports the research and clinical interpretation of genetic mutations, including mutations with unknown pathogenicity, by medical professionals and researchers.The use of this verification system ultimately offers the potential to deliver greater innovations in medical care for areas including treatment planning for genomic therapies for illnesses like cancer, accelerating the optimization of patient-centric medical care.BackgroundIn genomic medicine, knowledge about whether a genetic mutation in a patient has the ability to cause disease is essential. If researchers can locate a pathogenic mutation in a patient's gene, they can consider a treatment for that specific mutation. However, only a small percentage of the vast number of possible genetic mutations have been linked to disease. Genetic mutations with unknown pathogenicity present a challenge in that they do not provide useful information for treating disease.Since November 2016, Fujitsu and Kyoto University have been participating in the Integrated Database of Clinical and Genomic Information Program promoted by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, engaging in research and development to support the work of medical professionals and researchers in examining genetic mutations with AI and machine learning technologies. Fujitsu and Kyoto University have now developed an AI system that can estimate the presence or absence of disease causing potential for unknown genetic mutations and explain the basis for this finding. Kyoto University will make MGeND Intelligence available to joint researchers and collaborating institutions.Characteristics of the MGeND Intelligence verification system\"MGeND Intelligence\" is a verification system jointly developed by Fujitsu and Kyoto University, designed to support researchers studying genetic mutations. This was achieved through the application of three technologies possessed by Fujitsu Laboratories, Ltd.: machine learning technology trained on graph structure data (3) that can even express complex events; explainable AI technology that can clarify the basis of findings; and natural language processing technology that can accurately extract relationships such as mutations and diseases from a large corpus of textual data.When the genetic mutation information of a patient is input into the system, its ability to cause disease is estimated by the pathogenicity estimation AI using machine learning technology, and the explanatory text of the basis of this finding is generated and displayed together with the estimated result by the explainable AI. In addition, medical professionals and researchers can gather the basis of their estimation results by themselves. Information in public databases related to mutations and the certainty of estimation by AI can be displayed by multi-faceted visualization together with information on surrounding mutations, while researchers can use the literature search support AI, which leverages natural language processing technology, to search for articles related to target mutations and identify and display the descriptions.Fig. 1 System Overview1. Highly Accurate Estimation of Pathogenicity of Genetic MutationsBased on information from public databases related to genetic mutations whose pathogenicity is known, a Gene Mutation Knowledge Graph (4) was created--this serves as machine learning training data. In constructing the Knowledge Graph, a group led by Professor Yasushi Okuno of Kyoto University defined an effective graph range for estimation, and using Fujitsu Laboratories' \"Deep Tensor\" (5) machine leaning technology for training graph structure data, an AI was created that can accurately estimate the presence or absence of pathogenicity for gene mutations.2. Explain in natural text the rationale for the AI\u2019s finding in a way easy for medical professionals and researchers to understandWith estimation using \"Deep Tensor,\" it is possible to show the graph node that greatly contributed to the finding on the knowledge graph (6). However, since the determination of pathogenicity is carried out comprehensively based on multiple factors, it was not enough to explain the pathogenicity estimation simply by showing the part which became the basis of the finding on the knowledge graph. Therefore, interviews were conducted with Professor Okuno's group and genomic medicine researchers to determine what kind of explanation should be used to reliably estimate pathogenicity using AI and extracted multiple explanation patterns. Then, the degree of fit of each explanation pattern is calculated from the estimation factor obtained through the \"Deep Tensor,\" and a sentence explaining the basis of the finding is generated based on multiple patterns with a high degree of fit. Medical professionals and researchers can understand the important evidence that has contributed significantly to the estimation just by reading the explanation of the estimation.Fig. 2 Flow chart of generation of explanatory text of finding basis3. Helping Investigate Underlying Articles to Determine PathogenicityIn a large number of articles, the part describing the relationship between the target mutation and an arbitrary disease is searched, and the relevant part in the article is highlighted. For related information, for example, a large body of literature can explicitly display only the text that describes the relationship between the mutation and the drug. This makes it easy to examine the basis of findings contained in past papers and greatly reduces the time required to examine the estimation results based on known facts (7).With the cooperation of the Human Genome Center of the Institute of Medical Science at the University of Tokyo, an evaluation test of the entire pathogenicity estimation verification system was conducted, from the pathogenicity estimation to the acquisition of evidence, for unknown mutations (8) in the treatment of genetic disease, and made suggestions from a clinical perspective reflected in the system. As a result, it was confirmed that the results of the estimation of the pathogenicity for each mutation were reasonable, and that the text explaining the reason was appropriate from the viewpoint of specialists.For example, the pathogenicity of one mutation (9) was unknown at the time of the creation of the verification system used in the evaluation test, and was later judged to be pathogenic. In this case the pathogenicity estimation AI made a correct estimation of the mutation\u2019s pathogenicity. In addition, the evaluators were able to obtain an overview of the bases of the AI's findings by reading the AI-generated explanatory text, and to gather sufficient evidence to consider that it was pathogenic.Future PlansBased on these results, Fujitsu will further enhance its explanatory functions and develop new functions to support genomic medicine in hospital information systems, mainly based on the use of electronic medical records. Fujitsu will promote the introduction of these functions in hospitals and medical institutions throughout Japan.Kyoto University plans to provide MGeND Intelligence mainly to joint researchers and institutions participating in the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development project.[1]genetic mutation\uff1a\nIndicates the genetic diversity.

The model accomplishes this by detecting subtle changes in muscle movements that reveal differences in facial expression that occur when a person is concentrating or not.Conventionally, models that use AI to quantify concentration have been created by training algorithms to recognize the expressions and behaviors of people performing specific tasks, such as e-learning. Since facial expressions and behavior differ depending on the tasks involved and the cultural background in which each person grew up, however, the models created had to be individual models, and the challenge was to develop individual AI models for different, specific situations.Fujitsu has succeeded in the development of an AI solution that can identify common features that indicate concentration or non-concentration not easily influenced by subjects\u2019 cultural backgrounds. The AI leverages proprietary technology that detects action units (AU) (1), which express the \"units\" of movement corresponding to each muscle or each muscle group of the face based on an anatomically based classification system, with the world\u2019s highest accuracy (2). The technology captures changes over a short period of a few seconds, such as a tense mouth, and long-term changes over periods of tens of seconds, such as staring intently, with time frames optimized for each action unit. Data was collected from a total of 650 people from a variety of regions including the United States and China, in addition to Japan, engaged in tasks like memorization and searching that require concentration to create a machine learning data set. This was used to create a general purpose AI model that can determine levels of concentration without relying on task-specific behaviors. The effectiveness of this model was subsequently verified using this data set, and it was confirmed that subjects\u2019 degree of concentration could be quantitatively estimated with an accuracy rate of over 85%.Ultimately, this technology delivers AI support that offers the possibility of using accurate data about concentration and attention to improve the efficiency and productivity of peoples\u2019 activities online, as more and more aspects of life move online amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.Newly Developed TechnologyFujitsu has developed a general purpose AI model that quantifies concentration levels without depending on the detection of a specific task and regardless of cultural background by leveraging unique technology that detects facial expressions through Action Units with the world's highest accuracy.Using proprietary Action Unit detection technology that accurately learns the relative changes of facial expression muscles by training on a pair of images in which the intensity of movements of facial expression muscles differs, it becomes possible to capture changes over a short period of a few seconds, such as a tense mouth, and long-term changes over a period of several tens of seconds, such as staring intently, in time frames optimized for each action unit. A highly accurate concentration estimation AI model was then developed using a new method of integrated concentration estimation (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 New method overviewThis AI model was trained on a data set based on results of memorization and searching tasks that require concentration, drawing from a diverse pool of 650 people from Japan, the U.S., and China. The resulting general purpose AI model can quantify the degree of a subject\u2019s concentration or lack of concentration for a variety of tasks, such as whether someone is concentrating during e-learning, the degree to which someone is immersed in desk work, or the concentration levels of people engaged in plant assembly work, on a range from 0.0 (complete lack of concentration) to 1.0 (maximum concentration).Fig. 2 Concentration Estimation OverviewOutcomeIn order to verify the versatility of the AI model, Fujitsu constructed a data set for a total of 650 people from a variety of regions, including in Japan as well as in the U.S. and China. Using the newly developed AI model, the concentration levels of participants in each country was estimated for a series of tasks, and it was possible to estimate the degree of concentration with more than 85% accuracy. This result is comparable to or higher than the results from the latest international academic conferences quantifying the degree of concentration of students on e-learning tasks. It was confirmed that this method works effectively despite possible variations in cultural background.In addition, when the developed AI model was evaluated using data that included both concentration and non-concentration due to drowsiness, which was recorded by a drive simulator, it showed a high correlation with the correct data labeled based on a national Japanese research organization\u2019s index for measuring sleepiness (3), and it was confirmed that the decline in concentration due to sleepiness could be estimated. This confirms that the AI model can be applied to different tasks that it is not specifically trained on.Future PlansIn the future, in order to expand the application of this technology to various services such as online classes, online meetings, and sales activities, which are expanding globally amidst the \u201cNew Normal\u201d , we will further promote the rigorous verification of such technologies from the perspective of AI ethics, with the aim of realizing the practical use of trust-worthy AI technologies.[1]Action Unit\nThe movement unit of each part of the face corresponding to about 40 kinds of facial expression muscles defined in the Facial Action Coding System (https:\/\/www.paulekman.com\/facial-action-coding-system\/) proposed based on the anatomical knowledge.

The process of creating treatment plans using conventional methods is often laborious and time-consuming, and doctors must spend time making painstaking and detailed adjustments to determine how much radiation should be administered to a target while minimizing dose to surrounding tissue. With the newly developed technology, however, medical professionals can create treatment plans in roughly one minute, maintaining the same level of accuracy as conventional methods, while simultaneously calculating a huge number of possible combination patterns of where and how much dose to deliver with the Digital Annealer.By easing the burden on medical professionals in creating fast and accurate treatment plans, the new technology frees them to devote more time and energy to ensuring patients receive the most effective and humane care possible. Going forward, Fujitsu Laboratories and U of T researchers will continue to test the effectiveness of this technology based on additional patient data, and ultimately develop technologies that actively contribute to improvement of medical science and society at large.BackgroundGamma Knife surgery is used to treat brain tumors and other conditions because of its relative non-invasiveness and highly precise method of delivery of radiation. By using 192 different sources of gamma radiation aimed at different points, the dose to the affected area can be maximized while the dose to the surrounding healthy organs is kept very low. Parameters including position, shape, and dose of radiation must be considered to achieve optimal dosage to the affected area. However, the number of potential combination patterns is enormous, and in current medical practice, doctors generate treatment plans by manually repeating parameter adjustments based on their previous experience. This process can take about 1.5 to 3 hours to generate a plan that meets the patient\u2019s individual needs, placing a heavy burden on medical professionals.While the physician is preparing the treatment plan, the patient may also need to wait, frequently with a frame fixed to their head to limit movement, which may cause some physical discomfort. It is also necessary to secure medical personnel to help to prepare patients for treatment and make sure the frame remains in place.Recent years have witnessed the emergence of new tools to help ease this process\u2014for instance, software that automates the generation of treatment plans. In the field, however, it often remains the case that the generated plan still requires clinicians to manually modify and adjust the plans.Since 2017, Fujitsu and U of T have been collaborating in a strategic partnership centered on research relating to quantum computing. With this latest initiative, the parties have collaborated in the development of technology to help apply the use of the Digital Annealer for the generation of treatment plans for Gamma Knife therapies. Researchers at U of T and its medical institutions studied and developed methods to translate the Gamma Knife optimization to combinatorial optimization, a format understandable by the Digital Annealer technology developed by Fujitsu.Fig. 1 Overview of Gamma Knife TherapyAbout the Newly Developed TechnologyU of T researchers, through their methods and the use of Digital Annealer technology by Fujitsu, has developed the following technology to generate treatment plans at high speed while maintaining the same accuracy as treatment plans created by experienced doctors.1\uff0eUsing the physical properties of the human body (Dose Profile), the shot shape during gamma irradiation is modeled.In the past, shots (Concentrated area of gamma rays) formed by multiple gamma rays were assumed to be perfectly spherical during the shot position determination process. However, it has been found that the sphere is not necessarily perfect due to the influence of moisture in the human body. The newly developed technology determines the position of shots utilizing shot shapes reflecting the physical characteristics of gamma rays in the human body. This can contribute to the generation of more accurate treatment plans.2\uff0eOptimization of radiation parameters using the Digital AnnealerIn the past, during shot position determination process, multiple gamma ray radiation positions (Position of the shot) were determined sequentially; the position of the first shot was determined and the position of the second shot was determined after that so as to include the remaining part of the affected tissue as much as possible. However, this may not result to the optimal number of shots or positions. By contrast, the Digital Annealer allows users to search for the positions of all shots simultaneously at the beginning, resulting in a more accurate overall optimized treatment plan. It is also possible to obtain an optimized solution for the parameters of the radiation shape, enabling the rapid generation of a treatment plan that optimizes dosage for each patient.Fig. 2 Plan Flow with Conventional Method vs. New technologyIn a study of 49 cases of auditory nerve tumors, U of T researchers compared the newly developed technology against the conventional method. Referring to an index of radiation delivery accuracy, it was found that the developed technology was as accurate as manual planning. Additionally, while it took 1.5 to 3 hours to manually generate a plan, it was possible to reduce this to about 2 minutes with the newly developed technology.By supporting plan generation with the newly developed technology, the time required for Gamma Knife treatment, as well as the burden on patients and medical professionals can be drastically reduced. Reduction of personnel costs for hospitals can also be expected.Future PlansGoing forward, Fujitsu Laboratories and U of T researchers will continue to verify the effectiveness of this technology based on data from more patients, and will continue to develop technologies that offer the potential to contribute to medical science and society at large. Future potential projects include shortening the time required for Gamma Knife treatment processes themselves rather than the treatment plans, or applying this technology to other radiotherapy methods.[1]Gamma Knife therapy\nA noninvasive stereotactic radiation device that delivers gamma rays to the affected area.

Fujitsu is implementing the UNICEF Policy Guidance on AI for Children as part of an existing AI deployment in Finland and sharing first-hand experiences from the field to inform future versions of the guidance. The intention is to help businesses and governments ensure that future AI solutions are in the best interests of children.\n\nArtificial intelligence is driving innovation and delivering value and for businesses in all sectors. However, this powerful technology also potentially poses risks for children and their rights, such as privacy, safety and security. AI is increasingly being used to make decisions that affect the well-being of children, from the education they receive to decisions on family housing. However, most AI policies, strategies and guidance today do not take the needs of children into account.To tackle this growing problem, UNICEF has drafted approaches that protect and uphold children\u2019s rights to help fill this gap, compiling them into its AI Policy Guidance. The latest phase of this exploration focuses on a collaboration with 13 diverse international government and business \u201cpilot partners\u201d, including Fujitsu, that are interested in bringing a child-centered lens to generally-accepted AI policies and practices. Fujitsu is committing to implement the guidance.Fujitsu is testing the guidance in an AI solution called Nuora, developed in collaboration with the Finnish Eksote South Karelia Social and Health Care District. By leveraging AI-powered predictive analytics based on Fujitsu's XpressWay for AI solution, Nuora identifies and analyzes the factors that cause social exclusion. It can currently identify approximately 90% of the young people at risk of social exclusion and flag at risk individuals, improving early, targeted intervention and reducing healthcare and associated costs.Ilona Ylinampa, Head of Information Management from Fujitsu Finland comments: \u201cAI is increasingly being implemented in toys, interactive games, and mobile devices, with its algorithms guiding children\u2019s choices of everything from what to look at to who to connect with. It also supports a great deal of decision-making that affects children. We wanted to contribute to this valuable project, bringing Fujitsu\u2019s decades of experience in the field of AI to help ensure that businesses and governments alike have a strong foundation to ensure that AI is being implemented with children\u2019s privacy, safety and security taken into account. And, by ensuring that we can build trust in the decisions that AI makes for this vulnerable group, the technology has the potential to benefit not only individuals but society as a whole.\u201dJussi Kivipuro, Development Director at UNICEF Finland, says: \"The widespread deployment of AI provides many new opportunities to advance the well-being of children, but it also increases associated risks. Guidance is needed urgently, as AI is already embedded in children's everyday lives. Our pilot partners are helping UNICEF to take the guidance to the next level by committing to apply it in their own context in a safe and responsible way. They are openly sharing their findings about how it was used, what worked and what did not.\u201dFujitsu outlined its commitment to ethical artificial intelligence that is collaborative and human centric in its AI Commitment document1. This aims to build responsibility into Fujitsu\u2019s work in the field of AI through five critical pillars: providing value to customers; human-centric AI; striving for a sustainable society through AI; AI that respects and supports decision making; and emphasizing transparency and accountability for the technology. Participation in the UNICEF pilot project is the latest opportunity to put this commitment into action.Fujitsu is also a founder partner of the AI4People global forum, creating a platform for different stakeholders in shaping AI to discuss its social and ethical implications. The company is also closely engaged with the recently established EU AI Alliance, formed directly to contribute to the EU debate on AI and ensure good policies. The human rights of children and the ethical implementation of AI also form part of Fujitsu\u2019s broader commitment to Responsible Business2.\n\nNotes to editors1 Fujitsu announced the Fujitsu Group AI Commitment in March 2019 to express its approach to AI ethics in a concrete and easy to understand manner, based on over 30 years of R&D and AI implementation.2 The Fujitsu Group promotes its Sustainability activities based on the Fujitsu Way \u2013 which aims to make the world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation. https:\/\/www.fujitsu.com\/global\/about\/csr\/\n\nOnline resourcesFujitsu\u2019s 2020 Technology and Service vision: http:\/\/www.fujitsu.com\/global\/vision\/Read the Fujitsu blog: https:\/\/blog.global.fujitsu.com\/Follow Fujitsu on Twitter: http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/Fujitsu_GlobalFollow us on LinkedIn: http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/fujitsuFind Fujitsu on Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/FujitsuICTFujitsu pictures and media server: http:\/\/mediaportal.ts.fujitsu.com\/pages\/portal.phpFor regular news updates, bookmark the Fujitsu newsroom: https:\/\/www.fujitsu.com\/emeia\/about\/resources\/news\/newsroom.html\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Fujitsu\r\n\r\n\r\nFujitsu is the leading Japanese information and communication technology (ICT) company offering a full range of technology products, solutions and services.

The solution leverages a new AI technology to automatically measure the range of motion (1) of the shoulder and elbow joints from videos of patients' rehabilitation sessions.\"HOPE ROMREC\" is a solution that automatically measures, records, and visualizes the angles of a patient's shoulder and elbow by estimating a three-dimensional skeleton from rehabilitation videos captured using a tablet device (2). The solution leverages an image analysis AI engine developed by Fujitsu consisting of multiple AI image recognition models. The technology offers the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of the visual measurement of a patient's joint curvature using a goniometer (3), a task conventionally performed by physical therapists and occupational therapists. Ultimately, the solution will help medical professionals evaluate the effectiveness of physical and occupational therapies and determine the degree of their patients\u2019 conditions.Going forward, Fujitsu plans to continue strengthening the HOPE ROMREC solution and increase the number of measurement sites for range of motion detection. Fujitsu additionally plans to incorporate functions including automatic measurement of range of motion by simply sending video taken by a patient at home to their hospital or clinic, contributing to the realization of remote rehabilitation.BackgroundIn rehabilitation therapy, measuring range of motion is necessary to determine factors inhibiting joint movement, evaluate the effects of physical and occupational therapy, and determine the extent of a patient\u2019s condition. Physical therapists and occupational therapists make these measurements visually using goniometers, etc., however, which contributes to variation in measurement values from person to person. Conventional automatic measurement of range of motion demands special equipment, such as an acceleration sensor, which have not yet been widely implemented in the field. In addition to the system input work of measurement values, therapists now must also carry out extensive disinfection in rehabilitation areas to prevent COVID-19 infections , increasing the burden on medical facilities.To address these challenges, Fujitsu has developed the HOPE ROMREC solution, which automatically measures the range of motion of the shoulder and elbow joints by analyzing videos of patients' rehabilitation with AI. Sales of the new solution will begin in Japan on February 24.Key Features of the New Solution1. Automatic measurement of patient's range of motion with image analysis AI engineUsing an image analysis AI engine, which combines multiple AI image recognition models with previously learned motion patterns of a person's shoulder and elbow joints, it\u2019s possible to replicate a three-dimensional skeleton from a patient's rehabilitation video and automatically measure angles in a total of 16 motion directions for the shoulder and elbow. Therapists take the rehabilitation videos with a tablet\u2019s camera and send them to a dedicated PC equipped with an image analysis AI engine.The measured values are recorded as data and can be displayed as a time-series line graph, making it easy to grasp the effect and transition of individual patients' rehabilitation.It eliminates the need for accelerometers and joint markers on patients, as well as multiple cameras and specialized equipment such as infrared laser radar, which are required for conventional automated measurements of range of motion.This greatly increases the efficiency of therapists\u2019 work, which uses goniometers to visually measure a patient's range of motion, and helps assess the effectiveness of physical and occupational therapy and determine the degree of the patient\u2019s condition.Fig. 1 Automatic detection of joint range of motion2. Voice input function of the measured valueIn order to reduce the workload of therapists in rehabilitation areas other than shoulders and elbows, for which measurements can be automatically taken for the range of joint motion from video, the system is equipped with a voice input function that enables the tablet to automatically record and recognize when the user speaks the body part, direction of movement, and measurement values measured by their goniometer.This eliminates the need for note-taking and system input of measurement values that therapists typically perform, and enables measurement results to be recorded efficiently and quickly.Fig. 2 HOPE ROMREC Screen Image3. Easily link data with electronic medical records systemsSince the measurement data can be exported as CSV data, it can be easily incorporated into an electronic medical record system and a medical certificate preparation system, and it can be utilized for higher quality rehabilitation treatment based on the patient's treatment results and treatment plans.Pricing and AvailabilitySolution, Service NamePricing (excl. tax)Sales DateDate AvailableFUJITSU Healthcare Solution HOPE ROMREC V1 (image recognition) (Incl. 1 client)860,000 JPYFebruary 24March 5FUJITSU Healthcare Solution HOPE ROMREC V1 (voice input) (Incl. 1 client)860,000 JPYFUJITSU Healthcare Solutions\u3000HOPE ROMREC V1\n\n1 additional client fee230,000 JPY[1]range of joint movement\uff1a\nThe maximum range of physical movement of each joint of the body, measured in degrees[2]tablet device\uff1a\nPresently available on iPad[3]goniometer\uff1a\nMeasurement device used by physical therapists, occupational therapists, etc. to measure range of joint movement.About FujitsuFujitsu is the leading Japanese information and communication technology (ICT) company offering a full range of technology products, solutions and services.

To measure the time required for each work element from the video data, however, it\u2019s necessary to divide video data into separate work elements manually. This often means that the man-hours required to measure the time for each work element is several times to several tens of times more than the total length of the video.Fujitsu has expanded upon its \"Actlyzer\" technology for detecting human movement and behavior from video data, and developed an AI model that takes into account the variation of each movement and the difference in individual workers\u2019 movements, using work data from one person and the data divided by each work element as training data. When this technology was applied to the analysis of operations at Fujitsu I-Network Systems Limited\u2019s Yamanashi Plant (Location: Minami Alps City, Yamanashi Prefecture), it was confirmed that work tasks could be detected with 90% accuracy and that the results could be used to improve the efficiency of operations analysis.By leveraging this technology, Fujitsu will continue to contribute to the promotion of work process improvement activities and the passing on of specific skills for more efficient work at various sites.BackgroundAs Japan and many other advanced economies confront declining birthrates, the aging of society, and the increasing mobility of talent, a growing need exists in work that requires human labor to record and analyze vital know-how in the field and use it for creating manuals and offering onsite instruction. As a part of kaizen, or work process improvement, activities aimed at improving productivity and quality at manufacturing sites, many different methods of analysis utilizing video data (Fig.1) are carried out, including determining ways to eliminate waste, comparing work with skilled workers, and measuring the effect of time reduction through streamlining work processes. In these analyses, the work of breaking down video data of different work flows into separate work elements s (Step 2 in Fig.1), including separating the start and end of an element, often takes more than one hour for a 20 minute video, for example. This cumbersome editing process has presented challenges to efforts to accelerate work efficiency and the transmission of skills.Fig.1 Work analysis using video dataIssuesIn recent years, it has become possible to detect the movement of the human skeleton from video images and to recognize common tasks performed by multiple people by training the system using deep learning technologies. In order to achieve this, however, it\u2019s necessary to take into account the subtle variations in movements that occur between individuals even when they perform the same tasks, as well as the differences in movements among different people and environments. This must be done while additionally distinguishing between similar movements and preparing large amounts of training data.Newly Developed TechnologyFujitsu has successfully developed a technology to automatically detect work elements even for different video data of the same work, taking into account variations in motion and other similar movements, by learning each work element using data obtained by dividing a single video for each element as training data.First, in order to train the algorithm for different work elements, three-dimensional skeleton recognition technology included in Fujitsu\u2019s behavior analysis technology \"Actlyzer\" (1) is used to estimate a person's posture in three-dimensional space from the image that becomes training data. Then, changes in the posture of the upper body are acquired as feature values at intervals of several hundred milliseconds to several seconds, and similar feature values are grouped into several tens of unit movements (m1-mn in Fig.2). In this case, if the characteristics of the change in posture are similar, it is regarded as the same movement, so it is possible to deal with the difference in the way it appears depending on the working position and the position of the camera.Next, the division position (timestamp) of the work element section corresponding to the training data video is used to associate the discreet movement with the work element. At this time, by estimating the change pattern of the combination of discreet unit movements that constitute the work element and generating it as an AI model, it is possible to absorb the difference in the movement of individuals and the variations in the fine movement that occurs every time even when the same work element is performed. In addition, the AI model automatically recognizes work elements from the sequence of unit movements. This makes it possible to find the work element that best takes into account the overall order of work, even if the same work element exists more than once, such as \"tighten a screw\".Fig.2 AI model is generated as training data by dividing work video data and work elements of one person.OutcomesAt the Yamanashi Plant of Fujitsu I-Network Systems, which manufactures network equipment products, Fujitsu applied the developed technology to analyze the following three work processes (Fig.3): parts setting, assembly, and visual inspection, and conducted an evaluation.In each process, by only training with the division data of each work element of one person's video, the work element is automatically detected even in another video of the same work with 90% or more accuracy. As a result, the cycle of kaizen activities can be repeated more frequently, helping to improve work efficiency and accelerate the transfer of skills.Fig.3 Target work and various data in technical verificationFuture PlansIn addition to the manufacturing industry, Fujitsu will continue to verify this technology in various use case scenarios, including logistics, agriculture, and medical care, with the aim of putting it into practical use within fiscal 2021.[1]behavioral analysis technology \"Actlyzer\"Deep learning technology that can recognize a variety of subtle and complex human movements without relying on large amounts of training data.

A new AI model was then created using simulated offshore tsunami waveforms and coastal flooding conditions as training data.In the event of an actual earthquake, inputting tsunami waveform data observed offshore into this newly created AI model will allow for predictions of flooding conditions in coastal areas before landfall at high spatial resolution. This will make it possible to more accurately and rapidly obtain detailed flooding forecast data for specific areas, offering critical insights into the effects of localized waves on surrounding infrastructure like buildings and roads in coastal urban areas. Furthermore, the AI model, trained in advance with Fugaku, can be run in seconds on ordinary PCs, making it much easier to build practical, real-time flood prediction systems, which previously required supercomputers. Ultimately, this technology offers the potential for disaster management teams to make near real-time, data-driven disaster mitigation and evacuation measures.Fig. 1 Overview of tsunami prediction with AIBackground and ChallengesIn March 2011, The Great East Japan Earthquake triggered a massive tsunami that inflicted catastrophic damage in the Tohoku region along the eastern coast of Japan, throwing the challenges of disaster mitigation efforts into painful relief. This tragic event revealed that many issues remain from the viewpoint of acquiring and utilizing information for efficient and safe evacuation in the event of a disaster.Tsunami prediction represents one key area in this respect, requiring the development of technologies to allow authorities to quickly obtain accurate and detailed information to help disaster management teams mitigate damage by ordering appropriate evacuation actions. Since the Great East Japan Earthquake, the tsunami observation network in Japanese coastal waters has been significantly strengthened to this end, while the development of highly-accurate tsunami prediction technologies in coastal areas that leverage real-time off-coast tsunami observation data has been promoted as an urgent priority.Conventionally, coastal tsunami predictions have been mainly based on the method of selecting the data with the most similar earthquake and tsunami occurrence conditions compared with observations from databases prepared in advance by simulations, and the method of gradually adjusting coastal tsunami predictions to be consistent with offshore tsunami observations. In both cases, simulation calculations for flood predictions rely on large-scale supercomputers or database searches, which makes it difficult to implement and operate a feasible prediction system.About the Newly Developed Technology and InitiativeTo resolve this, Fujitsu, Tohoku University, and The University of Tokyo worked to jointly develop a high-resolution AI technology that can instantaneously predict tsunami flooding by utilizing the pre-shared evaluation environment of Fugaku in the research subject \"Exascale AI based Tsunami Forecast to Predict the Unpredicted\" (2) selected in the FY 2020 Fugaku Preliminary Use Projects (3) solicited by Research Organization for Information Science and Technology.By leveraging the exceptionally fast computing power of the supercomputer Fugaku, the project members generated training data for 20,000 possible tsunami scenarios based on high-resolution simulations in three-meter units. By training an AI model with these 20,000 data sets, it was possible to build an AI model that can predict the flooding of land areas with similarly high resolution from tsunami waveform data observed offshore at the time of an earthquake.For the AI model, a new deep learning technology was developed, with a two-stage configuration of AI that first approximates the flooding situation on land in rough resolution from the tsunami waveforms observed offshore. Then, the AI is applied to increase the resolution of the estimated flooding conditions and optimizes calculation performance for learning in Fugaku. Normally, computers suitable for simulation and computers suitable for AI are different, but with this initiative, the project members were able to leverage the special features (4) of Fugaku to greatly streamline the creation of AI for high-precision tsunami prediction by using training data generated on Fugaku as is for machine learning. Namely, Fugaku offered the project members a powerful resource that delivers high performance in both simulation as well as AI applications.When this technology was applied to the case of tsunami flooding prediction in Tokyo Bay caused by a theoretical, massive Nankai Trough earthquake, it was confirmed that highly accurate prediction was possible using a regular PC in a matter of seconds for a variety of different tsunami scenarios, including the tsunami model (5) assumed by the Cabinet Office of Japan (Fig. 2 & Fig. 3).By further utilizing the large scale, high speed performance of Fugaku in the future, while simultaneously training the system with additional tsunami scenarios, the partners can help to realize AI that can offer predictions for unexpected tsunami and flooding predictions over a wider area.Fig 2.

While AI technologies can automatically make decisions from data, \u201cexplainable AI\u201d also provides individual reasons for these decisions\u2014this helps avoid the so-called \u201cblack box\u201d phenomenon, in which AI reaches conclusions through unclear and potentially problematic means.\n\nWhile certain techniques can also provide hypothetical improvements one could take when an undesirable outcome occurs for individual items, these do not provide any concrete steps to improve.For example, if an AI that makes judgments about the subject\u2019s health status determines that a person is unhealthy, the new technology can be applied to first explain the reason for the outcome from health examination data like height, weight, and blood pressure. Then, the new technology can additionally offer the user targeted suggestions about the best way to become healthy, identifying the interaction among a large number of complicated medical checkups items from past data and showing specific steps to improvement that take into account feasibility and difficulty of implementation.Ultimately, this new technology offers the potential to improve the transparency and reliability of decisions made by AI, allowing more people in the future to interact with technologies that utilize AI with a sense of trust and peace of mind. Further details will be presented at the AAAI-21, Thirty-Fifth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence opening from Tuesday, February 2.Developmental BackgroundCurrently, deep learning technologies widely used in AI systems requiring advanced tasks such as face recognition and automatic driving automatically make various decisions based on a large amount of data using a kind of black box predictive model. In the future, however, ensuring the transparency and reliability of AI systems will become an important issue for AI to make important decisions and proposals for society. This need has led to increased interest and research into \"explainable AI\" technologies.For example, in medical checkups, AI can successfully determine the level of risk of illness based on data like weight and muscle mass (Figure 1 (A)). In addition to the results of the judgment on the level of risk, attention has been increasingly focused on \"explainable AI\" that presents the attributes (Figure 1 (B)) that served as the basis for the judgment.Because AI determines that health risks are high based on the attributes of the input data, it\u2019s possible to change the values of these attributes to get the desired results of low health risks.Fig.1 Judgment and explanation by AIIssuesIn order to achieve the desired results in AI automated decisions, it is necessary not only to present the attributes that need to be changed, but also to present the attributes that can be changed with as little effort as is practical.In the case of medical checkups, if one wants to change the outcome of the AI\u2019s decision from high risk status to low risk status, achieving it with less effort may seem to increase muscle mass (Figure 2 Change 1)\u2014but it is unrealistic to increase one\u2019s muscle mass alone without changing one\u2019s weight, so actually increasing weight and muscle mass simultaneously is a more realistic solution (Figure 2 Change 2). In addition, there are many interactions between attributes such as weight and muscle mass, such as causal relationships in which weight increases with muscle growth, and the total effort required to make changes depends on the order in which the attributes are changed. Therefore, it is necessary to present the appropriate order in which the attributes are changed. In Figure 2, it is not obvious whether weight or muscle mass should be changed first in order to reach Change 2 from the current state, so it remains challenging to find an appropriate method of change taking into the account the possibility and order of changes from among a large number potential candidates.Fig.2 Changes to attributesAbout the Newly Developed TechnologyThrough joint research on machine learning and data mining, Fujitsu Laboratories and Arimura Laboratory at the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University have developed new AI technologies that can explain the reasons for AI decisions to users, leading to the discovery of useful, actionable knowledge.AI technologies such as LIME (1) and SHAP (2), which have been developed as AI technologies to support decision-making of human users, are technologies that make the decision convincing by explaining why AI made such a decision. The jointly developed new technology is based on the concept of counterfactual explanation (3) and presents the action in attribute change and the order of execution as a procedure. While avoiding unrealistic changes through the analysis of past cases, the AI estimates the effects of attribute value changes on other attribute values, such as causality, and calculates the amount that the user actually has to change based on this, enabling the presentation of actions that will achieve optimal results in the proper order and with the least effort.For example, if one has to add 1 kg of muscle mass and 7 kg to their body weight in order to reduce the risk in the input attribute and its order (Figure 1 (C)) that they change to obtain the desired result in a medical checkup, it\u2019s possible to estimate the relationship by analyzing the interaction between the muscle mass and the body weight in advance. That means that if one adds 1 kg of muscle mass, the body weight will increase by 6 kg. In this case, out of the additional 7 kg required for weight change, the amount of change required after the muscle mass change is just 1 kg. In other words, the amount of change one actually has to make is to add 1 kg of muscle mass and 1 kg of weight, so one can get the desired result with less effort than the order changing their weight first.Fig.3 Interactions and changes between attributesEffectsUsing the jointly developed counterfactual explanation AI technology, Fujitsu and Hokkaido University verified three types of data sets (4) that are used in the following use cases: diabetes, loan credit screening, and wine evaluation. By combining three key algorithms for machine learning \u2014 Logistic Regression (5), Random Forest (6), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (7) \u2014 with the newly developed techniques, we have verified that it becomes possible to identify the appropriate actions and sequence to change the prediction to a desired result with less effort than the effort of actions derived by existing technologies in all datasets and machine learning algorithm combinations. This proved especially effective for the loan credit screening use case, making it possible to change the prediction to the preferred result with less than half the effort.Using this technology, when an undesirable result is expected in the automatic judgment by AI, the actions required to change the result to a more desirable one can be presented. This will allow for the application of AI to be expanded not only to judgment but also to support improvements in human behavior.Future PlansGoing forward, Fujitsu Laboratories will continue to combine this technology with individual cause-and-effect discovery technologies (8) to enable more appropriate actions to be presented. Fujitsu will also use this technology to expand its action extraction technology (9) based on its proprietary \"FUJITSU AI Technology Wide Learning\", with the aim of commercializing it in fiscal 2021.Hokkaido University aims to establish AI technology to extract knowledge and information useful for human decision-making from various field data, not limited to the presentation of actions.[1]LIME\uff1a\nAn explainable AI technology.

This technology enables identification with greater than 99% accuracy even when the user wears a mask, and will be showcased at a concept cashless Lawson convenience store at the Fujitsu Technology Square office in Shin-Kawasaki, Japan (1), for a field trial starting from January 2021.Users wearing masks present challenges to conventional facial recognition filtering technologies because a large part of the face is obscured, rendering authentication impossible in some cases. With the newly developed technology, however, differences in the appearance depending on the presence or absence of the mask can be absorbed by generating a composite image that combines the mask with the face image and training the model, achieving filtering accuracy of greater than 99%, or equivalent to that without a mask. Fujitsu has additionally enhanced its existing palm vein authentication sensor technology by improving the user interface so that users know how close to position their hand from the sensor for smooth authentication. This technology was ranked 6th amongst 147 participating global vendors and 1st place amongst Japanese vendors (2) in the face authentication vendor test conducted by the United States\u2019 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).Development BackgroundIn recent years, the use of biometric authentication technologies has been increasing, including in areas like the processing of payments at brick-and-mortar stores and in ID verification for events. Now, these technologies also promise to help limit the spread of COVID-19 by limiting human contact during transactions and verification processes. To this end, Fujitsu is accelerating the introduction of contactless user interfaces for authentication leveraging facial and palm vein recognition with a variety of field trials over the past year (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 Technology currently being verifiedChallengesIn many parts of the world, mask-wearing has been highlighted by health officials as an important tool to help prevent the spread of infectious diseases like the COVID-19 virus. However, when face authentication is performed while wearing a mask, most of the face is hidden, and the accuracy of this method can sometimes deteriorate. With this in mind, Fujitsu has worked to improve the accuracy of multi-factor biometric authentication at its pilot store by combining facial filtering technology with palm vein recognition. In addition, when considering the introduction of the system for general users in brick-and-mortar stores going forward, it will become essential to improve the user interface of the system to improve user-friendliness, allowing users to register and authenticate themselves without complex explanations or intervention from store clerks.Newly Developed TechnologyFujitsu Laboratories has developed a data expansion machine learning technology that enables highly accurate filtering even when the target user is wearing a mask.The features of the developed technology are as follows.With typical facial recognition technology, when a user is wearing a mask only the exposed eye area is checked in order to extract features such as the shape and position of the face. While this method can help reduce the influence of wearing a mask over an accurate reading, it cannot extract the features of the entire face, presenting the possibility that the target user cannot be recognized due to insufficient data.In order to reduce this effect, the newly developed technology generates an image of the user\u2019s face without a mask while taking into account the extraction of features of the entire face, like its shape and contours. This means that even when the user is wearing a mask, the user can be recognized against the corresponding facial image can be narrowed down from a large database with the same level of accuracy as without a mask. Specifically, the technology estimates the position of the face based on facial features such as the position of the eyes and nose, and based on the estimation results, an artificial mask is resized and reshaped then superimposed over the face image to generate a natural masked facial image. In addition, the system uses various types of masks in order to deal with situations in which masks of various colors, patterns and shapes are worn by users (Fig. 2). This makes multi-factor authentication more hygienic and easier to use by allowing people to undergo authentication without removing their mask.Fig. 2 Masks added to facial image dataImproved user interfaceThe user interface of the palm vein authentication system has also been improved to enable smoother use. A palm-shaped light has been added to the sensor, and the color and the pattern of the light changes according to the distance of the hand, so that the appropriate height for accurate authentication is apparent (Fig. 3). This allows people who are not familiar with palm vein authentication to adjust their palms to the appropriate height for smooth, contactless authentication (Fig. 4).Fig. 3 Image of the updated user interfaceFig. 4 Multi-factor biometric authentication terminal in useOutcomesBy using the newly developed technology and user interface, Fujitsu hopes to provide safer and more secure services while preventing the spread of infectious diseases in a variety of situations, including payments at brick and mortar stores using biometric authentication and personal identification at leisure facilities.Future PlansTo make sure users can do the authentication process by themselves using the developed technology and improved UI, Fujitsu will introduce this technology to a system currently under verification (3) at a concept cashless Lawson convenience store in Shin-Kawasaki Technology Square in cooperation with Lawson, a major Japanese convenience store chain. Fujitsu will conduct verification tests from January 21, 2021 with the aim of putting the system into practical use by the end of FY 2021.Related LinksDemo movie: \"Multi-factor biometric authentication terminal in use\"[1]a concept cashless Lawson convenience store the Fujitsu Technology Square office in Shin-Kawasaki\nSince February 2020, Fujitsu has been participating in a POC conducted by Lawson, Inc. for cashier-less solutions at a location in its offices.

This makes it possible to achieve greater accuracy in recognizing, for instance, when a person performs a task like removing objects from a box. This technology successfully achieved the world's highest accuracy (1) against the world standard benchmark (2) in the field of behavior recognition, with significant gains over the results achieved using conventional technologies, which don\u2019t make use of information on neighboring joints.By leveraging this technology to perform checks of manufacturing procedures or unsafe behavior in public spaces, Fujitsu aims to contribute to significant improvements in public safety and in the work place, helping to deliver on the promise of a safer and more secure society for all.Fujitsu will present the details of this technology at the 25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2020), which is being held online from January 10th, 2021 (Sunday) to January 15th, 2021 (Friday).BackgroundIn recent years, advances in AI technology have made it possible to recognize human behavior from video images using deep learning. This technology offers a variety of promising applications in a wide range of real-world scenarios, for example, in performing checks of manufacturing procedures in factories or detecting unsafe behavior in public spaces. In general, human behavior recognition utilizing AI relies on temporal changes in the position of each of the skeletal joints, including in the hands, elbows, and shoulders, as identifying features, which are then linked to simple movement patterns such as standing or sitting.With time series behavior-recognition technology developed by Fujitsu Labs, Fujitsu has successfully realized highly-accurate image recognition using a deep learning model that can operate with high-accuracy even for complex behaviors in which multiple joints change in conjunction with each other, such as removing objects from a box during unpacking.About the Newly Developed TechnologyComplex movements like unpacking involve hand, elbow, and shoulder joints moving in tandem with the arm bending and stretching. Fujitsu has developed a new AI model for a graph convolutional neural networks (3) that performs convolution operation of the graph structure by adopting a graph consisting of edges connecting adjacent joints based on the structure of the human body with the joint position as a node (Vertex). By training this model in advance using the time series data of joints, the connection strength (Weight) with neighboring joints can be optimized, and effective connection relationships for behavior recognition can be acquired. With conventional technologies, it was necessary to accurately grasp the individual characteristics of each joint. With an AI model that has already been trained, the combined features of the adjacent joints that are linked can be extracted, making it possible to achieve highly-accurate recognition for complex movements.Fig. 1 Outline of the newly developed technology compared with conventional technologiesThis technology was evaluated against the world standard benchmark in the field of behavior recognition using skeleton data, and in the case of simple behaviors such as standing and sitting in the open data set, the accuracy rate was maintained at the same level as that of conventional technology (4) that does not use information on neighboring joints. In the case of complex behaviors like a person unpacking a box or throwing an object, however, the accuracy rate improved greatly, to achieve an overall improvement of more than 7% over the conventional alternative to reach the world's highest recognition accuracy.Fig. 2 Improvement of accuracy with new technologyFuture PlansBy adding the newly developed AI model for recognizing complex behaviors obtained with this technology to the 100 basic behavior already accommodated by Fujitsu\u2019s behavioral analysis technology \u201cActlyzer,\u201d (5), it will become possible rapidly deploy new, highly-accurate recognition models. Fujitsu ultimately aims to leverage this new capability to roll out the system in fiscal year 2021, and contribute to the resolution of real-world issues to deliver a safer and more secure society.[1]world's highest accuracy\uff1a\nAs of January 13th, 2021.
