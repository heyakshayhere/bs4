What launched in 2019 as a pilot for expansion into only 10 states has quickly fast-tracked to a nearly national program in order to meet the evolving needs of customers, both during and after the COVID-19 crisis. Amazon now reaches beneficiaries in 48 states plus the District of Columbia, providing more than 99% of SNAP households1 with the ability to use their SNAP benefits online. Amazon volunteered to participate as a retailer in the USDA\u2019s SNAP Online Purchasing Pilot in 2016 because we believe in its goals and to ensure that all customers have the opportunity to order groceries online.SNAP recipients in Alabama, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming can now use their benefits to shop for groceries on Amazon and other participating retailers\u2014and we are working to expand access to additional states.With online acceptance of SNAP, Amazon\u2019s selection, competitive pricing, and home delivery can improve the grocery shopping experience for SNAP participants. Customers can shop for groceries across two Amazon services: Amazon Grocery (shelf-stable food and household items in varying sizes), and Amazon Fresh (fresh produce, meat, and more; available in select metropolitan regions)\u2014all with free shipping available. Amazon has waived the Prime membership requirement for SNAP customers to access Amazon Fresh, further reducing barriers to online grocery shopping.For further insight into the impact of online SNAP purchasing, we spoke with three leading hunger relief organizations fighting to end food insecurity\"SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, is our first line of defense against hunger by serving as a critical safety net for 1.6 million New Yorkers who struggle to make ends meet. By enabling SNAP EBT as a payment method online, low-income New Yorkers now have increased access to healthy food choices with the ability to purchase fresh produce and groceries for their families online.\" \u2013 Food Bank for New York City (FBNYC)\"The online SNAP purchasing pilot is one important piece of the puzzle for food access for low-income customers. It puts SNAP customers on an equal footing with other consumers and provides new options for them to get food into their hands. SNAP is one of our country\u2019s most vital social safety nets and must continue to play a critical role in reducing hunger, malnutrition, and poverty. Online ordering is important in regular times but especially so when all Americans have been encouraged to practice social distancing and protect individual and public health. The pilot program helps vulnerable households gain greater access to healthy food while staying home.\" \u2013 Food Research and Action Center (FRAC)\"We are grateful the USDA has been so quick to approve states\u2019 requests to make online SNAP purchases possible for their residents. Online SNAP is an incredibly powerful tool that makes it easier for SNAP recipients to purchase nutritious food, particularly for those who have challenges getting to a bricks-and-mortar store due to myriad barriers, including the unique challenges presented by the current COVID-19 public health crisis. We applaud USDA, the SNAP processors, and the many retailers who have responded to meet this demand in record time during unprecedented circumstances.\" \u2013 Alliance to End HungerAmazon is proud to continue to expand online SNAP acceptance to beneficiaries in more states and we remain committed to making food accessible through online grocery shopping, offering all customers convenience, time savings, and low prices delivered straight to their door.

According to recent data from the U.S. Small Business Administration, nearly one-third of small employer businesses in the U.S. are family owned. As part of Amazon\u2019s Delivery Service Partner (DSP) program, Amazon works with family-owned logistics and delivery businesses around the world to deliver packages to customers.Launched in 2018, the Amazon DSP program connects aspiring entrepreneurs with resources and coaching to help them build and scale their own businesses with Amazon. Today, Amazon partners with more than 3,000 DSPs globally that employ thousands of drivers and deliver for Amazon customers every day.Aimkhan Logistics and Total Package Logistics are two successful family-owned and women-led DSPs who have grown their businesses with Amazon. These DSP owners share their stories of how they got into business with their spouses, running their companies like family, and what their kids think of their parents\u2019 entrepreneurial journeys.Maha Al-Absi and Aqeel Ahmed, owners of Aimkhan Logistics, Worcester, Massachusetts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaha Al-Absi and Aqeel Ahmed spent most of their 20-plus-year careers in the corporate world working as certified project managers at large aerospace and insurance companies. Highly accomplished in their fields, they enjoyed their work. But they frequently discussed their own entrepreneurial ideas at the dinner table and how they could go into business together as a team one day.\u201cI had always talked about starting a logistics business, since 2011 in fact,\u201d said Ahmed. \u201cThe world is moving more and more online, and it was always something I thought I could do, but I never took the initiative.\u201dThat\u2019s where Al-Absi stepped in. \u201cIt was February 2020, and Aqeel and a friend were talking\u2014again\u2014about logistics businesses. I remember because it was my birthday,\u201d Al-Absi said. \u201cAfter all this talk and no action, I said \u2018Fine, if you\u2019re just going to talk about it, I\u2019m going to do something about it!\u2019\u201dAl-Absi applied for Amazon\u2019s DSP program and was accepted. \u201cI told Aqeel he had to run the business with me.\u201dAl-Absi and Ahmed launched their business in August 2020, during the height of the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon, Delivered: Meet four women leading in logistics\n\nInside Amazon delivery stations and out on the road, women are a driving force in the company\u2019s middle and last mile logistics. \n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe set up the home office in our living room right next to our children, who were doing remote learning. We say that they got their MBAs during that time.\u201d Parents to three kids, the two joke that they now have upward of 60 kids, having expanded from five drivers when they started their business with Amazon to more than 65 drivers today.\u201cOur drivers and employees are like our family. They know our kids; our kids know them. We support them and guide them like we would our own children,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cWe opened our business to help people. Not just to earn money, but to change people\u2019s lives. We mentor our drivers and encourage them to move on to bigger things in their lives.\u201dAt the end of the day, they see their business as a stepping stone for their employees.\u201cWe can provide our employees access, guidance, and support so they can learn how to become managers themselves and move up in their careers,\u201d Al-Absi said.For some, that means graduating college and paying off student loans. For others, it means becoming financially independent and moving into homes or apartments of their own.\u201cAt the end of the day, this is a family business, and we want our employees to achieve their goals and dreams, just like we desire for our children,\u201d Al-Absi said.Alison and Greg Gatto, owners of Total Package Logistics, Boca Raton, Florida\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Al-Absi, Alison Gatto acted on her husband\u2019s curiosity and became an entrepreneur and DSP owner somewhat by accident.Gatto was living her dream of owning a successful luxury salon in Florida in 2018. She\u2019d opened the salon 10 years earlier and had grown a staff and clientele that she was immensely proud of. A decade into living her dream, a chance conversation with her husband changed her life.\u201cHe had heard about this program with Amazon to open a small delivery business, and I just thought it sounded like something I\u2019d be good at. Even though I didn\u2019t know anything about logistics, I knew a lot about managing people,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how much it would positively change the course of my life.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon, Delivered: From survivor to inspirational entrepreneur\n\nA difficult past didn\u2019t stop Amazon Delivery Service Partner Sophia Strother from realizing her potential, while inspiring others. Find out how Strother became a thriving business leader, entrepreneur, and community advocate.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGatto applied and was accepted into the DSP program and soon found herself launching a new business endeavor in an industry that she knew little about. Together, she and her husband Greg learned as much as they could about logistics and found that running a delivery business was not too dissimilar from running the many other businesses\u2013including a burger restaurant\u2013they\u2019d owned over the course of their marriage.\u201cThe great thing about working with your spouse or partner is that you know their quirks, their strengths, and if you know how to communicate with each other, you can work well together,\u201d she said. \u201cI leave the manual labor and repairs to him; he leaves the operations to me!\u201d\u201cBoth my husband and I are very entrepreneurial,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s always been self-employed and encouraged me to live out my dream of starting and owning businesses as well.\u201dGatto\u2019s three daughters think what their mom is doing is pretty neat.\u201cMy middle daughter is 15 years old, and she\u2019s taken an interest in the business.

With the County Board\u2019s approval, we look forward to continuing our work with the community as we take the next steps on this journey to build an integrated, innovative, and sustainable second headquarters in Arlington, Virginia.We announced in late 2018 that Arlington, Virginia, would be home to Amazon\u2019s second headquarters (HQ2) and that we would bring more than 25,000 jobs to the region. Since then, we\u2019ve made some significant progress in our commitment to be a trusted business and community partner. We\u2019ve continued to engage with local organizations and now work with over 100 nonprofits, civic groups, and small businesses, providing in-kind support and charitable donations.Our hard-working recruiting teams have crossed an important hiring milestone, with more than 5,000 employees now assigned to our second headquarters. Our construction partners have put in more than 2 million hours of work and recently celebrated finishing the top floor\u2014the \u201ctopping out\u201d\u2014of Met Park, the first phase of HQ2. And finally, our architecture, design, sustainability, and transportation teams have engaged with the local community and partnered with Arlington County to continue improving the design of PenPlace, the next phase of our development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon\u2019s HQ2 takes shape as construction reaches top floor\n\nAmazon joins local community leaders and construction workers to celebrate completing the top floor of construction at HQ2.\n\n\n\n\nWatch now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we prepare to take the next step in our more than $2.5 billion HQ2 investment, we want to provide a snapshot of what the project will bring to the Arlington community and the wider region. Here are some highlights:More sustainable, by designWhen we announced the development of HQ2, we challenged ourselves to think big and design Amazon\u2019s buildings in a way that helps lead the industry toward net-zero carbon. In pursuit of this goal, we have electrified the operations of HQ2, eliminating the use of fossil fuels for buildings systems and our food service. We\u2019ve committed to powering 100% of HQ2\u2019s operations with renewable energy through a combination of off-site and on-site solar projects, aligning with The Climate Pledge, Amazon\u2019s commitment to be net-zero carbon across its operations by 2040.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenPlace will provide more than 100,000 square feet of retail space for dining, shopping, and a childcare facility. Multimodal pathways will connect throughout the site to prioritize access by foot and bike.Download the high-res image.\n\nTo do this, we\u2019ve contracted 82 megawatts (MW) of energy from a new 120 MW solar farm in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, which is expected to generate 172,500 megawatt hours (MWh) of renewable energy annually once operational later this year. The renewable energy generated at this site will be used in part for the operation of HQ2 and other Amazon-owned buildings across Virginia, including Whole Foods Market stores and Amazon fulfillment centers. The remaining portion of energy generated by the solar farm has been contracted by Arlington County and will provide clean energy for use in the region. At PenPlace, we will also have rooftop solar panels installed, totaling 1 MW of clean energy capacity to further support our sustainability efforts.Our plans to focus on sustainability at PenPlace include:Committing to achieve LEED Platinum certification, the highest sustainability certification for a development issued by the U.S. Green Building Council.Integrating strategic climate-responsive design for our office buildings, including high-performance glazing and built-in solar shading that will reduce the need for building heating and cooling, targeting a savings of 30% over the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) baseline.Providing more than 125 electric vehicle charging stations, with the ability to double capacity as needed.Leveraging low-flow fixtures and reclaimed water usage to reduce water consumption by 50% beyond national standards.Reducing the amount of embodied carbon in the concrete structure compared to typical construction practices by at least 10%, along with a commitment to offset 100% of the remaining embodied carbon from building materials.Using bird-safe glass where appropriate on all seven buildings at PenPlace to ensure that the development is safer for the region\u2019s bird population.Connecting the neighborhoodWe\u2019ve designed PenPlace to be part of the local neighborhood because we want both employees and local residents to enjoy the space equally. This means considering how people will travel to get to PenPlace and how they will utilize the space each day. Our plans prioritize access by foot, bike, and public transportation, with a 15-foot-wide multimodal path that will be part of the Green Ribbon, a network of pedestrian and shared-use pathways throughout the neighborhood. When complete, PenPlace will provide more than 900 interior and exterior bike storage stalls, to encourage bike commuting over the use of single-occupancy vehicles. All vehicle movements on-site will occur underground, including loading docks, which allows for contiguous outdoor public space with gathering areas, public plazas, and ample green space for the community to enjoy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn open-air amphitheater will provide space for programming and events, including concerts, farmers markets, and evening movie screenings.Download the high-res image.\n\nProviding parks and public spaceAfter engaging with the local community, we heard feedback from our neighbors and shifted our designs to integrate more planting areas and maximize publicly accessible green space at PenPlace. The project will create 2.75 acres of public park space, available for community use, including immersive forest rooms, shaded seating groves, water features, and many native and pollinator gardens. We will plant more than 100 native plant species and over 500 new trees throughout the site\u2014all inspired by the natural ecosystems of the surrounding region. An open-air amphitheater will provide space for programming and events, including concerts, farmers markets, and evening movie screenings. We will also build a dog run for Arlington\u2019s four-legged residents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the central green, PenPlace will include immersive forest rooms, shaded seating groves, water features, a dog run, and many native and pollinator gardens, all for the community to enjoy.Download the high-res image.\n\nAdding vibrancy to the neighborhoodOne of the main opportunities of designing a welcoming, inviting, and well-connected development will be the ability to support vibrant, local small businesses. PenPlace will provide more than 100,000 square feet of space for dining, shopping, a childcare facility, and other opportunities across the main buildings and three retail pavilions. We\u2019re also dedicating over 26,500 square feet to establish a new home for Arlington County Community High School. This public school will provide an opportunity for approximately 300 students to pursue their academic goals while preparing for the future.Building more than office spaceThe Helix, a spiral-shaped building in the northeast corner of PenPlace, will become a landmark for Arlington and the National Landing area. This distinctive building will take our biophilic-led design principles to new heights, integrating nature and working to inspire innovation and invention. The interior of the Helix will provide formal and casual meeting spaces in an environment filled with more than 25,000 square feet of planting areas and living walls. The exterior of the structure will feature two paths for employees to engage with colleagues in meetings or to take in views of Arlington, the Potomac River, and Washington, D.C. The Helix will also be home to an artist-in-residence program and a meeting center, and it will be open to the public and community to enjoy two days per month. We can\u2019t wait for everyone to see this unique and thoughtfully designed space come to life.Engaging with the local communityWe know that success and scale bring broad responsibility, and we strive to be good neighbors in the communities in which we operate. When we chose National Landing as the site of HQ2, we made a commitment to be a trusted business and community partner in the region, and our work to become a part of the fabric of this community reflects that commitment daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst local retailers sign on to open shops at Amazon\u2019s HQ2 \n\nDistrict Dogs and R\u0100KO Coffee are the first small businesses to sign leases at HQ2 as part of Amazon\u2019s pledge to bring local, minority- and women-owned retailers to its second headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. \n\n\n\n\nWatch now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince we announced Arlington as the site of HQ2 in 2018, we have committed more than $35 million in total investments to local nonprofits, community groups, public schools, and businesses. This includes both monetary and in-kind donations\u2014like school supplies to public schools across Northern Virginia and food donations to local food banks and pantries for families in need. We also know that housing affordability is front of mind for many in the community. Through the Housing Equity Fund, we\u2019ve contributed more than $800 million to support affordable housing in the Arlington and metro-Washington, D.C., areas, with more to come. Since the launch of the Amazon Housing Equity Fund 15 months ago, our efforts are helping to create and preserve more than 4,400 affordable homes. Based on data provided by Arlington County, the Fund has helped to increase the affordable housing stock in Arlington by 22%.We will continue to engage with the Arlington community to understand how we can best support the issues that matter to local residents. Our goal is to build a second headquarters that integrates into the surrounding neighborhood and benefits the entire region. We appreciate Arlington County and the community\u2019s partnership in this process, and we are excited to continue the conversation.\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nHQ2Amazon officesJob creation and investmentArlington\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            Building on progress at Amazon\u2019s HQ2 in Arlington, Virginia\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","4":"\n\n\nCompanies use AWS services in creative ways to build local and global innovations designed to address the climate.\n\nIn February, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaption and Vulnerability report, which warns that climate change \u201cimpacts are approaching irreversibility.\u201d To create the report, hundreds of leading scientists contributed data and 195 countries agreed and signed on. The report states:Some losses are already irreversible, such as the first species extinctions driven by climate change \u2026 Other impacts are approaching irreversibility such as the impacts of hydrological changes resulting from the retreat of glaciers, or the changes in some mountain \u2026 and Arctic ecosystems driven by permafrost thaw. (page 10)The hopeful part about that excerpt are the words \u201capproaching irreversibility.\u201dIt means, while the window is closing, we still have time to mitigate\u2014and even turn around\u2014major aspects and impacts of climate change. But we need to act now. That\u2019s exactly what some Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers are doing\u2014using AWS services to innovate in areas like tree equity, biodiversity, and waste reduction.Environmentally friendly ride-sharingIn 2016, Volkswagen Group (Volkswagen), an AWS customer, created its MOIA ride-sharing service to address the issues of fossil fuels and emissions head-on with its fully electric vehicle fleet. Unlike most other ride-sharing services, MOIA was fossil fuel free from inception. Volkswagen uses electric batteries to run MOIA\u2019s custom-built, special-purpose vehicles.\n\nMOIA Ridesharing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, MOIA ride-sharing is available in two German cities\u2014Hamburg and Hanover. Riders use the MOIA app to order ride service, and they share their vehicle with up to five people traveling in the same direction. The app\u2019s user interface (UI) includes pick-up and overall trip times, stops en route, walking duration needed to complete the journey, and vehicle number.Volkswagen designed MOIA as a stable, cost-efficient, sustainable alternative to traditional ride-share fleets. They built MOIA using AWS services, including Internet of Things (IoT) that powers the vans\u2019 sensors and let MOIA collect data and continually improve performance. \u201cAWS provides us with a variety of services we need so we can combine them together. We use a lot of IoT and AWS IoT Greengrass to have Lambda@Edge in the vehicle to collect all of the data,\u201d says Moritz Siuts, director of engineering at MOIA. This year, Volkswagen plans to pilot MOIA autonomous ride-share vehicles in Hamburg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Next: Using data to address tree cover and climate change\n\nThe Nature Conservancy uses cloud technology to provide tree shade access in neighborhoods\u2014regardless of income, race, or ethnicity. The story is part of Climate Next, a new AWS documentary series.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMOIA's electric ride-share solution results in fewer cars on city streets and improves the quality of life in cities\u2014local changes that contribute to global environmental impacts. It\u2019s a model for the environmental slogan: \u201cThink globally, act locally.\u201dLos Angeles tree program addresses climate change and shade disparityOne of the greatest counterforces to climate change is nature. Trees, for instance, help abate climate change through air pollution reduction and carbon sequestration. The latter involves any biological, chemical, or physical processes that naturally capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.However, inequities exist in many U.S. cities when it comes to tree cover. Disadvantaged and low-income communities have 15.2% less tree cover and are 37.4 \u00b0F (2.7 \u00b0C) hotter than high-income areas. The Nature Conservancy helps Los Angeles address this disparity using data and AWS services to support ArcGIS StoryMaps, which helps the city garner support for increasing tree cover in underserved communities.\n\nLos Angeles: Plant a Tree, Grow a Community | Climate Next by AWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArcGIS StoryMaps is a story-authoring, web-based application that allows users to share their maps in the context of narrative text and other multimedia content. The geographic information system (GIS) technology it\u2019s based on is a spatial system that creates, manages, analyzes, and maps all types of data. Esri, which is an AWS Partner Network (APN) Partner, created the application.Werner Vogels, Amazon\u2019s chief technology officer, created the Climate Next series to highlight AWS technologies that AWS customers and AWS-supported initiatives use to solve complex human problems. Climate Next featured The Nature Conservancy\u2019s work to reduce tree disparity in Los Angeles.According to The Nature Conservancy, 83.6% of people live in urban areas. \u201cIf we want to make an impact on climate change in people's lives, we have to consider how our cities are going to cope with the climate crisis that we are in,\u201d said Tanushree Biswas, carbon program director at The Nature Conservancy. \"Story maps are a great way for us to translate complicated science into action items.\"Biodiversity and ecosystem modeling in Costa RicaAlthough Costa Rica accounts for only 0.03% of the Earth\u2019s surface, it\u2019s home to nearly 6% of the world\u2019s biodiversity. The National Center of GeoEnvironmental Information (CENIGA) at Costa Rica\u2019s Ministry of Environment and Energy (MINAE) is a technical intelligence unit that uses mapping and modeling tools to integrate, standardize, and communicate Costa Rica\u2019s environmental data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCENIGA convenes with governments and scientific institutions worldwide to develop methods that identify biodiversity patterns, helping leaders to make better decisions and policies for sustainable development in Costa Rica and around the world.The process begins with Earth observations (EO)\u2014data about Earth\u2019s physical, chemical, and biological systems. Examples of EO data include recording rainwater trends, monitoring temperature, and mapping forest cover. Satellite technology makes it possible to capture EO information by using remote sensing in near real time, providing a more comprehensive picture than with data collection on the ground.However, standalone EO cannot fully assess ecosystem properties like biodiversity and changes over time. The analysis also needs ecosystem service modeling, which uses geospatial data to predict patterns about a real ecosystem. Pairing robust EO datasets with modeling leads to more accurate and relevant predictions of how ecosystems behave and might evolve. The work starts with accessing the EO datasets available on AWS and then using the data to conduct the ecosystem service modeling with AWS Cloud technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA look at Amazon\u2019s sustainability efforts this Earth Month\n\nLearn more about how Amazon is reducing carbon emissions and creating a more sustainable shopping experience for customers.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCENIGA built its infrastructure on AWS with AWS Promotional Credits from the Earth Observation Cloud Credit Program, a collaboration between the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI)\u2014a program that seeks to accelerate sustainability research and innovation by minimizing the cost and time required to acquire and analyze large sustainability datasets\u2014and the Group on Earth Observations (GEO).Immersive 3D shopping experiences built on AWSA 2021 Corporate Social Responsibility Survey reports that 83% of consumers believe that businesses should actively shape their best practices around environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. Climate change is a key ESG issue, and retailers are actively looking for ways to reduce their carbon footprints and reach net-zero emissions targets in the next few years. However, with consumers increasingly shopping online, extra packaging, fulfillment, and transportation needs are increasing emissions.Creating and selling a product involves a long chain of transactions, with each one contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the production of visual assets that power the customer experience for retail and consumer packaged goods includes transporting models and photographers to shoots, and the shipping and disposal of items involved in production.What if products didn\u2019t need to be shipped, dressed, photographed, and retouched? What if consumer conversion rates could increase by 70% and returns reduced by 40% by using 3D visualization?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOregon community and AWS work together to benefit local agriculture\n\nReused water from AWS data centers helps grow crops.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHexa is an AWS Partner and 3D commerce and augmented reality (AR) expert. The company offers retailers 3D asset pipelines and AR features that provide consumers with virtual and immersive try-before-you-buy interactions. These interactions enhance online shopping experiences for customers, and they help brands and retailers achieve their sustainability goals by reducing returns and cutting the unnecessary impact of physical product marketing.Hexa uses AWS services to turn nearly any image into a 3D model. Retailers can layer the 3D images onto a real-world environment (for AR) or provide 360-degree views on product pages. Retailers can replace products, change colors and configurations, and swap entire item sets with the click of a button.Hexa\u2019s sustainability-first approach helps its customers increase market share and sales, lower consumer acquisition costs, and reduce returns, while simultaneously reducing the environmental impact of online consumer purchases.Find these\u2014and other\u2014examples of AWS\u2019s commitment to sustainability throughout the year on the Climate Next and Sustainability Customer Stories pages.The AWS Sustainability page also provides ongoing coverage.

In Margaret Atwood\u2019s new short story, \u201cMy Evil Mother\u201d (free for Prime and Kindle Unlimited members in eBook and audiobook), a woman remembers when her mother issued a prophecy: If she didn\u2019t break up with her high-school boyfriend immediately, the relationship would end in a disastrous fate. Her mother had consulted the tarot, and the Universe didn\u2019t like them together. \u201cI still believed that my mother had some influence over the Universe,\u201d the daughter admits, from the distance of many years.Struggling for independence from an overbearing and controlling mother is never easy, but it\u2019s especially challenging if you, like the narrator, believe that your mother is a witch with supernatural powers. Though this mother looks like the other mothers in their mid-1950s Toronto suburb\u2014crisp shirtdress, flowered apron, single-strand pearls\u2014she doesn\u2019t act like the other mothers. For one thing, she runs the household on her own, with no father in sight. And then there\u2019s her convincing insistence that she has privileged access to the shape of the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe story comes from Margaret Atwood, who in her more than five-decade writing career has herself been suspected of oracular talents. The prolific and award-winning author, whose novels include The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, has been hailed as a seer for her uncanny habit of plausibly predicting which way the wind is going to blow.On the morning before this year\u2019s spring equinox, we drank coffee and nibbled pastries in her large, sunny kitchen in Toronto, and discussed \u201cMy Evil Mother.\u201d Like the daughter in the story, I was raised by a single mom who read tarot cards, and so I brought my deck to give Atwood a reading.\n\n\n\n\n                \u201cThere are an infinite number of possible futures, and which one you get is going to depend on what you do now\u201d\n            \n\nMargaret Atwood, award-winning writer and author of \"My Evil Mother\"\n\n\n\n\nBefore I pulled any cards, however, she\u2019d read my palms with great accuracy. (\u201cBe careful with who you allow in the door.\u201d) At one point she disappeared briefly and came back with taped-together mass-market copies of Joseph F. Goodavage\u2019s Write Your Own Horoscope and Maria Elise Crummere\u2019s Sun-Sign Revelations, both of which she\u2019d used for hand-casting her friends\u2019 horoscopes before the internet, calling the practice \u201cvintage woo!\u201d We spent a lot of time laughing as we talked about intuition, the enduring allure of esoteric systems, the power of ambiguity in stories and in prophecy, and the timeless need to read the signs.Below are highlights from our conversation, including insights into her new work and what the cards say about her future:\u201cMy Evil Mother\u201d is, among other things, an intergenerational tale featuring mothers who find creative ways to protect their daughters. What\u2019s your take on the idea of \u201cmother\u2019s intuition?\"What is mother\u2019s intuition, anyway? If you\u2019ve grown through 500,000 years of evolution in which it\u2019s important for you to pay attention to the moods of those around you, because your own well-being depends on it\u2014the needs of those more powerful than you in the group, and the moods and reactions of those dependent on you, such as children\u2014that\u2019s not some kind of secret power, it\u2019s heightened power of observation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Amazon employee reads great books on behalf of our customers\n\nWelcome to our new series \"Real (cool) jobs at Amazon,\" where we highlight some of the most peculiar jobs at Amazon. \n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you think all women have this heightened power of observation?Well, what century are we living in?

They should stay in the home and take care of them. I used to collect this stuff, I have a book called The True Glory of Woman\u2014and that would include dealing with the bedpans. Because we\u2019re so good at it.So this thing we call intuition\u2014some men appear to be quite intuitive, and other men appear not to be. So, let us say it is an individual thing. We happen to notice people who have this hyper-noticing ability in connection to children when we see it in action, but it certainly doesn\u2019t mean every woman has it, and it doesn\u2019t mean that every man is without it. Caregivers of any kind have to read the signs, and the signs are physical. It\u2019s not something in the air. You\u2019re noticing people\u2019s behavior and their facial expressions.In the spirit of reading signs, what is it about astrological systems\u2014tarot, palm reading, astrology\u2014that interests you the most?I\u2019m curious about these things in the way that I\u2019m curious about just about everything.TikTok currently has over 30 billion views on the #astrology tag and roughly 20 billion views on the #tarot tag.

[She laughs.] We love being told things about ourselves that we don\u2019t know.As long as they\u2019re flattering.As long as they\u2019re flattering.You\u2019ve written about the fact that you learned to read tarot cards in the late 1960s, while studying T.S. Eliot\u2019s poem, \u201cThe Waste Land.\u201d Tarot was experiencing an uptick then, too. Do you see a pattern to these cycles of interest?The old ways of knowing about oneself are going out of fashion. [In the late 1960s] it was no longer so chic to have a Freudian analyst, or even a Jungian one. The more chaotic things appear out there, the more people are in search of some form of structure, a way of making sense. It\u2019s certainly a period of chaos\u2014old values being challenged, stuff falling apart, political systems that worked for a long time being called into question, and major power struggles going on all around us, of many different kinds.One possible read of why the mother in your story reaches for supernatural strategies is that they provide a way to exercise power and agency in an environment in which these might otherwise not be available to her as a single mother in the 1950s.I think that\u2019s why a lot of people do this stuff. I think they are in search of protection and agency.In the story, the mother says, \u201cThey may not like me, but they respect me. Respect is better than like.\u201d The daughter doesn\u2019t agree at all. What are your thoughts?It\u2019s nice if you can be likable, but sometimes you just can\u2019t be. If everybody likes you, there\u2019s something wrong. You don\u2019t want a lot of schmucks liking you. Sam, my next-door neighbor, a gruff lawyer, came out one autumn as I was sweeping up my leaves, and he says, \u201cMargaret, you shouldn\u2019t let people see you do that,\u201d and I said, \u201cSam, what are you talking about?\u201d And he said, \u201cIt\u2019s the broom. Don\u2019t you know they call you the Wicked Witch of the Annex?\u201d I said, \u201cSam, people respect fear. It\u2019s better to be feared than liked.\u201d And he said, \u201cMargaret, you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders\u2019 favorite quotes from Amazon\u2019s best-selling books of all time\n\nAmazon reveals the most-highlighted passages from its best-selling eBooks of all time. \n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOracles in the ancient world were always ambiguous. They didn\u2019t say, this will inevitably happen. They were like warnings\u2014if this, then that. People ask, \u201cAre you prophetic?\u201d and I say absolutely not. There isn\u2019t one The Future. There are an infinite number of possible futures, and which one you get is going to depend on what you do now. But of course, the other bad thing about that is that you can\u2019t infallibly predetermine the results of your own actions.The \u201cevil\u201d mother in your story relies on tarot (and even pulls three cards about her daughter\u2019s \u201csurly faced\u201d boyfriend that she claims add up to a tragic fate). So in the spirit of the story, I\u2019ll pull three cards for you.The first is Ten of Pentacles; the energy of this card is looking backward and forward at the same time. The second is Ace of Wands, with Aces being gifts and tools, and Wands being about life force and the will. You have a strong will! But we knew that. The last card is Six of Cups. Are you writing about the past?I have been. How did you know that?Six of Cups is usually about memory and childhood, and can also be the sweetness of early connections. When it\u2019s negatively aspected, it can refer to being stuck in the past. But beside Ten of Pentacles and Ace of Wands, I would read it as speaking to your creative work.I\u2019m about to start a memoir.That\u2019s exciting. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve written a memoir before, have you?Bits and pieces here and there, but no, not a whole book.It looks good, the cards are all very positive.We\u2019ll see how it turns out.\u201cMy Evil Mother\u201d by Margaret Atwood from Amazon Original Stories is available now. Like all Amazon Original Stories titles, the story is free to Prime members and Kindle Unlimited subscribers, and $1.99 for non-members.

As customers increasingly shop online and look for even faster delivery, Amazon continues to invent new ways to raise the bar on customer and employee experience while working with other companies focused on those fields.Amazon has invested and innovated substantially over the last two decades in next-generation technology in its operations. This new fund is one of the ways Amazon continues to invest, along with many other initiatives, such as the MARS and re:MARS conferences that Amazon hosts every year. The conferences bring together innovative minds in machine learning, automation, robotics, and space to share new ideas across these rapidly advancing domains.\u201cWe see an opportunity to look beyond our own experience and empower companies that are developing emerging technologies in customer fulfillment operations, logistics, and the supply chain,\u201d said Alex Ceballos Encarnacion, Amazon\u2019s vice president of worldwide corporate development. \u201cWe know there are companies out there that share our curiosity and excitement to invent. Whether our investment helps them grow or leads them to work with Amazon, or both, we\u2019re excited to help advance these technologies as online shopping becomes even more important to people who are looking for more convenience and time savings.\u201dThe Amazon Industrial Innovation Fund will invest in companies that imagine solutions that incrementally increase delivery speed and further improve the experience of employees working in warehousing and logistics fields.\u201cThese industries are inherently complex,\u201d said Ceballos. \u201cWith our scale, Amazon is committed to investing in companies that will ignite innovation in emerging technologies that can help improve employee experiences and safety while seamlessly coexisting with workforces across the supply chain, logistics, and other industries.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon makes historic launch investment to advance Project Kuiper \n\nWith new long-term launch commitments, Project Kuiper prepares for future satellite deployments.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon has a history of investing in technologies within its operations that support employees and customers, like artificial intelligence, robotics, and other cutting-edge inventions. Some past improvements include robotic arms that perform repetitive tasks and new products in autonomous movement that can help transport larger items.\u201cInvesting in companies that are driving the next generation of industrial innovation can have impact across communities\u2014globally, regionally, and locally,\u201d said Bob O\u2019Donnell, founder and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see Amazon make these investments in companies in the U.S. and around the world, as historically, ongoing investment in innovation has shown to have a positive economic impact.\u201dCeballos said that\u2019s the goal. \u201cEven as we have continually improved our operations to better the employee experience and enhanced safety through the development of new workstations with better ergonomics, we hope this fund opens the door for more collaboration,\u201d said Ceballos.The Amazon Industrial Innovation Fund\u2019s first round of investments is focused on wearable technology that enhances safety in fulfillment buildings and robotics designed to complement and coexist with people\u2019s lives. Below are details about those innovations and the companies behind them:Modjoul: Founded in 2016 and based in Greenville, South Carolina, Modjoul is developing wearable safety technology that enables real-time, personalized alerts and recommendations aimed at reducing injuries, most notably musculoskeletal issues.Vimaan: Founded in 2017 and based in Santa Clara, California, Vimaan is developing computer vision and artificial intelligence solutions engineered to improve inventory management.Agility Robotics: Founded in 2015 and based in Corvallis, Oregon, Agility Robotics is developing a bi-pedal walking robot, Digit, that addresses the mobility limitations of traditional robots so that machines can assist people wherever they are.BionicHIVE: Founded in 2014 and based in Israel, BionicHIVE is developing an autonomous robotic solution that can adapt to existing shelving racks and boxes in warehouses and is capable of floor to ceiling functionality.Mantis Robotics: Founded in 2020 and based in San Francisco, Mantis Robotics is developing a tactile robotic arm that uses sensor technology to cohesively work alongside people.Learn more about the Amazon Industrial Innovation Fund.FAQsWhat are the goals of the fund?

One week after the opening of the first humanitarian aid hub in Slovakia, we are adding a second humanitarian aid hub in Poland dedicated to getting much-needed supplies to Ukrainian refugees.\n\nA look inside one of Amazon's humanitarian aid hubs in Poland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facility is near Sosnowiec, a city in southern Poland, and consists of 3,500 square meters (nearly 37,680 square feet) of warehouse space where our employees consolidate, pack, and ship millions of critical supplies. The supplies are being distributed to Ukrainian families in partnership with charities like Save The Children and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The addition of this new facility nearly doubles the space we\u2019ve dedicated to procuring first-need products for those impacted, and the effort continues to be Amazon\u2019s largest humanitarian operation to date.Amazon\u2019s newest humanitarian hub expands on the ongoing relief efforts that we\u2019ve supported in Poland since the beginning of the crisis in Ukraine. Amazon has donated close to $1 million to Polish organizations supporting refugees on the ground, in addition to $5 million in donations to global NGOs actively working in Poland like UNICEF, UNHCR, Red Cross, and Save the Children.

It gave him firsthand experience of the challenges of navigating the investing landscape. As someone from an underrepresented community, he\u2019s seen how the pool of businesses that receive funding is often homogeneous. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaudius Mbemba, CTO and co-founder of Spritz (formerly Neu)\n\n\u201cIt's all about the money flow. As soon as investors and those with access to opportunity start investing in a more diverse range of recipients, then we will start moving in the right direction,\u201d said Mbemba. \u201cIt's a self-fulfilling prophecy. You get access to the capital, which creates incentives for investors to open up their networks to you, which can help your business meet the next milestone, which creates success. When people don't invest in founders from diverse backgrounds, they're not creating that momentum and not helping fulfill that prophecy. It comes down to that.\u201d This funding gap, as well as difficulties accessing training, networking, and mentoring opportunities, are just some of the issues faced by underrepresented founders\u2014like Mbemba\u2014that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is committed to addressing. It\u2019s why AWS is launching a new AWS Impact Accelerator that commits more than $30 million over the next three years to early stage startups led by Black, women, Latino, and LGBTQIA+ founders.Each qualifying startup receives up to $225,000 in combined cash and credits, training, mentoring, and technical guidance\u2014as well as introductions to Amazon leaders and teams, networking opportunities with investors, and advisory support. Eligible startups can now apply to the first of these programs, the AWS Impact Accelerator for Black Founders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow it works\n\nFind details on the AWS Impact Accelerator for Underrepresented Founders and learn how the program will support early-stage startups led by Black, women, Latino, and LGBTQIA+ founders. \n\n\n\n\nLearn more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've been in situations and cohorts where people tell me it's so easy to raise money,\" said Mbemba. \"And I'm thinking, \u2018That's not the experience I'm having.\u2019 Friends and family investing doesn't work for me. I don't have people who can just invest $100,000 to get my business off the ground.\" To put this into perspective, studies consistently show that Black, women, Latino, and LGBTQIA+ startup founders are underrepresented across the total number of founded and funded startups. In 2021, U.S. startups founded solely by women raised nearly $6.4 billion in venture funding, according to PitchBook data. But that number only accounts for 2% of overall investment dollars that year, which was $330 billion. For example, according to StartOut, an organization that supports LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs, if everyone had equal access to funding and resources, there would be 10 times more LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs in the U.S. We spoke to Mbemba, an AWS customer, and two other startup founders who work with AWS, about their experiences of building successful businesses as a part of an underrepresented demographic, how strong partnerships and accelerator programs changed the game for them, and why more initiatives like AWS Impact Accelerator are vital. Marcus Bullock, CEO, FlikshopIn 2012, Marcus Bullock launched Flikshop, a platform that sends photos delivered as postcards to any person in any prison instantly, with an often difficult topic on his resume\u2014a felony conviction. At the age of 15, Bullock entered a maximum-security prison to begin an eight-year sentence for carjacking a man in a parking lot. During this time, he said he cycled through \u201canger, frustration, and complete disillusionment.\u201d What kept him afloat was regular correspondence from his mother. \u201cShe wanted me to understand that there was still life to be lived,\u201d said Bullock. \u201cAnd so, she made a commitment to send me photos and write me letters every day until I came home.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcus Bullock, CEO, Flikshop\n\nThat constant reminder of life on the other side continued to drive Bullock when he got out. He founded a painting business and used the profits to fund the development of Flikshop, an app built on AWS that lets anyone take a picture, write a message, and send it as a physical postcard to an incarcerated friend or loved one.Yet Bullock had no technical skills when he left prison. Inmates weren\u2019t allowed to use computers, and when he began his sentence, the internet was still on the perimeter of mainstream culture. His only experience of it was through movies. \u201cYou think you understand what it does. But it didn\u2019t really exist when I went in, and when I came home, there it was,\u201d he said. \u201cTo go from nothing to suddenly being able to type anything into a search bar, and to have all this information pop up, was just the most mind-blowing experience ever. The whole world had changed.\u201dHis reaction? To dive right in. The more Bullock learned about developing applications for smartphones and the web, the more he learned what he needed to learn. Questions that tech insiders consider common parlance were alien to him at that point. \u201cWhat does UX\/UI mean? What are wireframes? How do we think about pricing? What is a server? What's the difference between hosting servers and cloud computing? I had a massive knowledge gap in trying to figure out how to launch,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a gap that Bullock has been incredibly successful in bridging. Flikshop has now shipped over 700,000 postcards to inmates in jails, prisons, juvenile facilities, and ICE detention centers around the country, and continues to grow 20% month over month. The company has also developed enterprise partnerships with Fortune 100 companies such as Boeing, Bank of America, and AWS. Looking back, when Bullock considers what advice he would have given himself when starting the business, one thing stands out\u2014strengthen your network. \u201cI didn't realize that having a felony would matter after I had proven I could generate revenue,\u201d he said. \u201cOr that not having access to social capital would differentiate me.\u201d That's where accelerator programs and competitions changed the game. In 2018, Flikshop entered two incubator programs and finally developed the traction it needed to grow. Having singer John Legend\u2019s campaign FreeAmerica partner with Bank of America and New Profit to invest in the business also helped. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS helps diversify tech and entertainment\n\nFrom haircuts to Master\u2019s degrees\u2014AWS provides tools and resources that facilitate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) opportunities for customers and institutions.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can't outwork relationships,\u201d said Bullock. \u201cNo matter how incredible your product is, no matter how amazing the technology or the tool you\u2019re able to introduce, no matter how incredible your marketing or strategy across platforms\u2014relationships are what matter. It\u2019s the people who become your advocates, supporters, and sponsors. It\u2019s the people who kick down a door for you and say to someone, \u2018Hey, you need to figure out a way to collaborate with Marcus.'\" Adriana Vazquez, CEO, Lilu When Adriana Vazquez started her smart garment company Lilu in 2017, she quickly found that the resources readily available to her Ivy League classmates were far harder for her\u2014a woman and a Latina immigrant\u2014to access. Recent Crunchbase data, for example, shows funding for early stage startups led by Latinx founders has almost completely stalled in the past few years. \u201cSuch a small percentage of venture capital funding goes to Black and Latina founders,\u201d said Vazquez. \u201cThe odds are really stacked against us.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdriana Vazquez, CEO, Lilu\n\nVazquez persisted. Leaning on technical degrees from both MIT and the University of Pennsylvania, she developed the first Lilu smart bra for breastfeeding mothers. Vazquez had seen so many of her women colleagues deal with the stress, even shame, of pumping\u2014a critical task for any mother who needs to keep up her milk supply\u2014while at work or on the go. Not only that, but most pumps were cumbersome and uncomfortable to use. \u201cTechnology should make people's lives better, easier, and bring joy into them,\u201d she said. \u201cI was surprised by how technology wasn't supporting moms as well as I knew it could.\u201d Vazquez needed to prototype and get her product into customers\u2019 hands, all of which required a great deal of testing and iteration, not to mention time and capital. In the beginning, Lilu was aided by grants and prizes in pitch competitions, but the boost it received from larger accelerators, and funding from America\u2019s Seed Fund, a National Science Foundation program, really put her company in gear. \u201cA good accelerator with a good program, really early on, can make such a big difference,\" she said. \u201cSo many founders don't have necessary resources, connections, or access to capital. But these are the things that make the impossible possible. We have people innovating from all cultures and parts of the world, and they typically don't have access.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen founders: How to beat bias to get backing for your business\n\nWhen it comes to raising capital for your startup, the gender gap remains painfully real.

Claudius Mbemba, CTO and co-founder of Spritz (formerly Neu)Claudius Mbemba, who grew up in Cameroon and immigrated to the U.S., saw from a young age how technology could improve lives in his country of birth. He showed an early talent for shaping technology as he saw fit, writing computer programming scripts and even hacking a gaming system his father bought. \u201cI was fascinated with technology and how it could enable me to access and create the things that I wanted to see in the world,\u201d said Mbemba. That drive eventually led him to major in computer science at Ohio State University, before working as a software engineer. He later co-founded Neu, a business that helped connect vacation rental owners with housecleaners, the way Uber connects drivers and passengers.\u201cI've always had a knack for spotting things that could be better and solving that problem,\u201d he said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS empowers startups solving critical challenges in the cloud \n\nAmazon Web Services is launching two AWS Global Accelerator programs to help startups address some of the world\u2019s most pressing challenges while building successful, cloud-based businesses.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Mbemba is engaged in a huge pivot, transforming Neu into a new business called Spritz\u2014a software as a service (SaaS) platform that provides housecleaning professionals with the tools they need to grow and manage their operations, such as back-office functions, operations, logistics, and administrative tasks. To do this, the company needed advisors and a broader field of investors who share Mbemba\u2019s experience and deeply understand the business. \u201cIt's about having representation and investors and mentors understanding the technology and business model,\u201d he said. Mbemba points out that immigrants and entrepreneurs share an important quality\u2014making big, bold leaps. He has an adage when it comes to taking the plunge, as he\u2019s done many times in his life. \u201cThe sooner you start, the sooner you finish,\u201d he said. \u201cOften, prospective entrepreneurs and business leaders will delay because they don't know how exactly to make a change. On the startup journey, you will encounter \u2018unknown unknowns.\u2019 Those unknowns are best solved by just doing the thing.\u201d AWS Impact Accelerator The AWS Impact Accelerator gives high-potential, pre-seed startups the tools and knowledge to reach key milestones such as raising funds or being accepted to a seed-stage accelerator program, while creating powerful solutions in the cloud. Participants accepted into the eight-week program will create a wide-ranging, personalized training curriculum from dozens of available sessions delivered by AWS startup experts and guest speakers, and will also learn how to use Amazon processes such as \u201ctwo-way door decision making\u201d and \u201cworking backwards\u201d to drive day-to-day decisions and build nimble, innovative teams. Applications are now open for the first AWS Impact Accelerator for Black Founders, with the program kicking off in June for U.S.-based startups. The first AWS Impact Accelerator for Women Founders will take place in the second half of the year for U.S.-based startups, and the AWS Impact Accelerators for LGBTQIA+ Founders and Latino Founders respectively will follow in 2023.Read the press release for more information.\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nDiversity, equity, and inclusionAWSInnovation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            AWS launches $30 million Impact Accelerator for underrepresented founders\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","12":"\n\n\nThe company announces 37 new renewable energy projects totaling 3.5 GW of clean energy capacity. \n\nAmazon is continuing to scale its renewable energy investments with 37 new renewable energy projects around the world, marking significant progress on its path to power 100% of its operations with renewable energy by 2025\u2014five years ahead of the original target of 2030. The new projects increase the capacity of Amazon\u2019s renewable energy portfolio by nearly 30%, from 12.2 gigawatts (GW) to 15.7 GW, and bring the total number of renewable energy projects to 310 across 19 countries.The additional 3.5 GW of clean energy capacity from these new projects extends Amazon\u2019s leadership position as the world\u2019s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy, and advances its efforts to meet The Climate Pledge, a commitment to be net-zero carbon by 2040\u201410 years ahead of the Paris Agreement.\n\n\n\nThese projects will generate enough carbon-free energy annually to avoid emissions equivalent to more than 3.7 million cars in the U.S. each year.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOur commitment to protecting the planet and limiting Amazon\u2019s impact on the environment has led us to become the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world in both 2020 and 2021. Given the growth of our business, and our mission to run 100% of Amazon\u2019s operations on renewable energy, we aren\u2019t slowing our renewable investments down,\u201d said Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon. \u201cWe now have 310 wind and solar projects across 19 countries, and are working hard to reach our goal of powering 100% of our business on renewable energy by 2025\u2014five years ahead of our original target of 2030.\u201dThe 37 new projects are located across the U.S., Spain, France, Australia, Canada, India, Japan, and the United Arab Emirates. They vary in project type and size, with three new wind farms, 26 new solar farms, and eight new rooftop solar installations at company buildings around the world. As a result of these projects, Amazon now has a total of 310 renewable energy projects, including 134 wind and solar farms and 176 rooftop solar projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData helps AWS customers cut their carbon emissions\n\nAWS's new tool makes it easy for customers to monitor, analyze, and reduce their carbon footprint.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce operational, Amazon\u2019s 310 projects are expected to produce 42,000 gigawatt hours (GWh) of renewable energy each year\u2014enough electricity output to power 3.9 million U.S. homes annually. The carbon-free energy generated by these projects will also help avoid 17.3 million metric tons of carbon emissions annually, avoiding the equivalent of the annual emissions of more than 3.7 million cars in the U.S. each year.Amazon also continues to invest in renewable energy projects paired with energy storage. The energy storage systems allow Amazon to store clean energy produced by its solar projects and deploy it when solar energy is not available, such as in the evening hours, or during periods of high demand. This strengthens the climate impact of Amazon\u2019s clean energy portfolio by enabling carbon-free electricity throughout more parts of the day. The new projects include a 300-megawatt (MW) solar project paired with 150 MW of battery storage in Arizona and a 150 MW solar project paired with 75 MW of battery storage in California. Combined, the two projects double Amazon\u2019s total announced solar paired with energy storage from 220 MW to 445 MW.\u201cAmazon continues to be a leader in rapidly scaling up renewable energy projects here in the U.S. This increasingly includes hybrid projects that pair energy storage with renewable energy generation, unlocking the ability to use clean reliable energy throughout all hours of the day,\u201d said Heather Zichal, CEO of the American Clean Power Association.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainable buildings\n\nAmazon is designing buildings that help lead the industry toward net-zero carbon, while improving the resource efficiency of our facilities and prioritizing the health and wellness of our building occupants.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow are more details about the latest series of renewable energy projects, which will supply clean energy for Amazon\u2019s operations, including its corporate offices, fulfillment centers, and Amazon Web Services data centers that support millions of customers globally.23 projects in the U.S., spread across 13 statesThe new projects bring Amazon\u2019s total clean energy procurement in the U.S. from 7.2 GW to 10.4 GW. Notably, the new projects include Amazon\u2019s largest renewable energy project (by capacity) announced to date, which is a 500 MW solar farm in Texas.

Whether customers are ordering chilled or frozen foods from Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market will arrive insulated in packaging that is easy and convenient for customers to recycle at home.Moving to all curbside-recyclable insulation packaging reduces material waste and each year replaces approximately 735,000 pounds of plastic film, 3.15 million pounds of natural cotton fiber, and 15 million pounds of non-recyclable mixed plastic. The new packaging is also produced regionally in the U.S., enabling us to deliver it to Amazon Fresh grocery hubs, stores, and Whole Foods Market locations with fewer miles traveled across the supply chain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload this image.\n\nI\u2019m excited and optimistic about the feedback we\u2019re hearing from customers.

Thank you for taking care of our environment.\u201dThis new packaging is just the latest step in Amazon\u2019s commitment to both The Climate Pledge, a bold commitment to be net-zero carbon across our business by 2040, and to building a sustainable business for our employees, customers, and the planet. We couldn\u2019t have done it without Joe Rake, who spearheaded the new project while a senior program manager on the grocery delivery packaging team.I recently sat down to talk with Rake, who shared some great behind-the-scenes insights about the project that I want to share with you. We know that addressing the global crisis of climate change will take a combination of big, bold commitments and everyday actions. We\u2019re doing both as we build an environmentally sustainable business and support the communities where we live and work.How would you describe the problem we were trying to solve for customers?We have long wanted to find a more sustainable solution for the plastic liners and bubble bags that are often used to insulate chilled and frozen items. The criteria for any new packaging solution came down to five key considerations. First, and probably the most obvious, we wanted to ensure the packaging maintained product chill chain and Amazon\u2019s high bar for food safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload this image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload this image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, the packaging needed to be small, compact, and flexible for our delivery drivers. Think of it as fitting multiple grocery bags into the trunk of a Prius, so switching to stiff cardboard boxes for insulation wouldn\u2019t work. Although they\u2019d maintain food-safe temperatures, boxes would take up more room, which would mean fewer grocery deliveries per vehicle, ultimately resulting in more vehicles\u2014and carbon emissions.The third major consideration was that any new packaging needed to be easily recyclable\u2014as in, customers could leave it with the rest of their curbside recyclable material. Fourth, it also needed to be inexpensive and scalable because we wanted to continue to ensure that Amazon\u2019s grocery delivery offerings were widely accessible for customers.And finally, we wanted to generate less overall packaging for customers. We are continually inventing new packaging solutions, and sometimes the simplest action is to use less of it, especially when Mother Nature provides her own \u201cchill chain\u201d in colder months.How did you and the team go about getting started?We started by taking a lot of inspiration from past sustainable packaging innovations at Amazon. Our teams are constantly working on ways to minimize waste, increase recycling, and provide options for customers to reuse, repair, and recycle their products. The goal is to send less material to the landfill and more back into the circular economy loop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload this image.\n\nWe also built on the progress we\u2019d already made with grocery delivery packaging. In 2018, we introduced frozen water bottles as an alternative to frozen gel packs to provide a grocery insulation solution that\u2019s widely recyclable or reusable by our customers. That step had a similar ethos to what we were looking to do with this new packaging initiative. And then in 2019, we started investigating a solution for the plastic liners and bubble-bag insulation. Nothing on the market was able to meet our physical, thermal, and sustainable design criteria, which started us on our journey to develop a solution ourselves.After a lot of rigorous testing and customer feedback, we landed on a version of recycled paper tissue layering that\u2019s relatively common in the moving and packing industry but that we reinvented for our grocery delivery customers.How did you test the product and gather customer feedback?We tested the thermal effectiveness of the all-recyclable paper solution in our internal thermal labs, as well as in multiple external labs in North America and Europe, to validate it met the needs of our delivery chill chain. The chill chain is the process of keeping frozen foods frozen, and refrigerated products chilled, at the correct temperature until the end of a customer\u2019s delivery window.In this controlled environment, we tested worst-case scenarios in temperature barriers and how changing the thickness, or \u201cwadding,\u201d of the packaging would affect the outcome of the results. Once we started seeing consistent results in the lab, we moved to the pilot stage in 2020. We conducted pilots in multiple cities and under a variety of temperature scenarios.At the same time, as we slowly rolled this out, our food safety team conducted secret-shopper programs to validate the thermal effectiveness of the packaging. We also paid very close attention to customer feedback along with employee feedback on how to best pack orders using the new packaging.Why is this packaging unique to the grocery delivery industry?As the leader of grocery delivery, we recognized an urgent need to find sustainable solutions that can eliminate hard-to-recycle materials\u2014and we are proud to be focused on scaling these solutions. This recyclable packaging will hopefully inspire others, both at Amazon and elsewhere, to continue finding creative, sustainable solutions for customers and communities around the world.Learn more about Amazon's efforts to improve our packaging and reduce waste.\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nAmazon FreshPhysical retailSustainabilityShopping\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            Grocery delivery just got more sustainable with Amazon\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","14":"\n\n\nWhen her son was diagnosed with autism during the pandemic, Ginny turned to Alexa: \u201cHe gets a lot of joy from being heard and understood like that.\u201d\n\nAutism impacts more than 5 million people in the U.S. While it looks different for every person, the developmental disorder often affects a person\u2019s skills in communication, self-regulation, and self-expression.At 18 months old, Zach was diagnosed with autism. Not long after, his mother Ginny and the rest of the family began speech therapy with him. To Ginny\u2019s surprise, the Echo devices she already had throughout her home took on an entirely new, important role in her family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about Ginny\u2019s story, in her own words:My son, Zach, was diagnosed with autism at 18 months old. Ever since he could walk, he\u2019s been obsessed with Alexa. Before we even had kids, my husband and I had started buying Echo devices to play music, and by the time Zach was born, we had them all over the house.It was toward the beginning of the pandemic when Zach was diagnosed with autism. My husband and I found ourselves on our own managing Zach\u2019s speech therapy virtually. Zach is nonspeaking and struggles with social interactions, so one of the key outcomes of his therapy is increasing receptive language and encouraging joint attention\u2014the kind of back and forth you have in a conversation with someone. We already knew how much Zach loved Alexa, so incorporating Alexa into this process seemed like a really natural step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have a device called an AAC we use to encourage Zach\u2019s communication behaviors. The way this works is that Zach can press buttons that correlate to certain words and phrases, and the device generates an electronic voice that expresses those words and phrases out loud. For Zach, we created an Alexa button on this device, as well as buttons for some of Zach\u2019s favorite things to ask Alexa. In particular, he loves the \"Animal Sounds\" skill, so he\u2019ll press the right combination of buttons and the generated voice will ask Alexa to play an animal sound of Zach\u2019s choice. When Alexa responds to his electronic voice, Zach gets so excited. He lights up immediately and starts running around\u2014he gets a lot of joy from being heard and understood like that.As a family, we love playing kids games with Alexa. In these games, Alexa prompts you with a question and waits for you to respond\u2014and we use them as a way to encourage Zach\u2019s speech development. When Alexa pauses, it\u2019s signaling to Zach that it\u2019s holding space for him to respond, and over time that teaches him to have that back and forth. Zach loves Alexa so much that playing these games has made his therapy less work and more PLAY! Playing with Alexa while learning is a huge motivator for him.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexa can help everyone, even cats\n\nLearn how a veterinarian uses Alexa to care for animals, including her own pet cat.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust a few weeks ago, Zach said his first \u201creal\u201d word. That\u2019s a huge milestone for any parent, but for us it was even bigger. Zach\u2019s first word was \u201canimal,\u201d and he was talking to Alexa, asking to play \"Animal Sounds.\"We even have an Echo in Zach\u2019s bedroom, and every night I initiate his bedtime routine. We\u2019ve made him an Amazon Music playlist, called \u201cZach\u2019s Lullaby Playlist,\u201d and Zach will signal to us every night when he\u2019s ready for us to get his bedtime routine underway.Alexa has become such an important part of our lives\u2014these days Alexa even comes on vacation with us, because we don\u2019t want to be without such an important part of our routine. When I think back on my husband and I buying Echo devices, I\u2019m just amazed at how essential Alexa has become to us, in a way we never could have foreseen. Alexa has been such an immensely useful tool, and we\u2019re so grateful to have it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Learn more about how you can incorporate Alexa into your family\u2019s life, or read more about Alexa\u2019s accessibility features.If you have a story of your own about how you use Alexa, we'd love to hear it, and we will continue sharing some of our favorite #AlexaStories.

But, this is the first time I\u2019ve had the honor of writing our annual shareholder letter as CEO of Amazon. Jeff set the bar high on these letters, and I will try to keep them worth reading.When the pandemic started in early 2020, few people thought it would be as expansive or long-running as it\u2019s been. Whatever role Amazon played in the world up to that point became further magnified as most physical venues shut down for long periods of time and people spent their days at home. This meant that hundreds of millions of people relied on Amazon for PPE, food, clothing, and various other items that helped them navigate this unprecedented time. Businesses and governments also had to shift, practically overnight, from working with colleagues and technology on-premises to working remotely. AWS played a major role in enabling this business continuity. Whether companies saw extraordinary demand spikes, or demand diminish quickly with reduced external consumption, the cloud\u2019s elasticity to scale capacity up and down quickly, as well as AWS\u2019s unusually broad functionality helped millions of companies adjust to these difficult circumstances. Our AWS and Consumer businesses have had different demand trajectories during the pandemic. In the first year of the pandemic, AWS revenue continued to grow at a rapid clip\u201430% year over year (\u201cYoY\u201d) in 2020 on a $35 billion annual revenue base in 2019\u2014but slower than the 37% YoY growth in 2019. This was due in part to the uncertainty and slowing demand that so many businesses encountered, but also in part to our helping companies optimize their AWS footprint to save money. Concurrently, companies were stepping back and determining what they wanted to change coming out of the pandemic. Many concluded that they didn\u2019t want to continue managing their technology infrastructure themselves, and made the decision to accelerate their move to the cloud. This shift by so many companies (along with the economy recovering) helped re-accelerate AWS\u2019s revenue growth to 37% YoY in 2021.Conversely, our Consumer revenue grew dramatically in 2020. In 2020, Amazon\u2019s North America and International Consumer revenue grew 39% YoY on the very large 2019 revenue base of $245 billion; and, this extraordinary growth extended into 2021 with revenue increasing 43% YoY in Q1 2021. These are astounding numbers. We realized the equivalent of three years\u2019 forecasted growth in about 15 months.As the world opened up again starting in late Q2 2021, and more people ventured out to eat, shop, and travel, consumer spending returned to being spread over many more entities. We weren\u2019t sure what to expect in 2021, but the fact that we continued to grow at double digit rates (with a two-year Consumer compounded annual growth rate of 29%) was encouraging as customers appreciated the role Amazon played for them during the pandemic, and started using Amazon for a larger amount of their household purchases.This growth also created short-term logistics and cost challenges. We spent Amazon\u2019s first 25 years building a very large fulfillment network, and then had to double it in the last 24 months to meet customer demand. As we were bringing this new capacity online, the labor market tightened considerably, making it challenging both to receive all of the inventory our vendors and sellers wanted to send us and to place that inventory as close to customers as we typically do. Combined with ocean, air, and trucking capacity becoming scarcer and more expensive, this created extra transportation and productivity costs. Supply chains were disrupted in ways none of us had seen previously. We hoped that the major impact from COVID-19 would recede as 2021 drew to a close, but then omicron reared its head in December, which had worldwide ramifications, including impacting people\u2019s ability to work. And then in late February, with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, fuel costs and inflation became bigger issues with which to contend.So, 2021 was a crazy and unpredictable year, continuing a trend from 2020. But, I\u2019m proud of the incredible commitment and effort from our employees all over the world. I\u2019m not sure any of us would have gotten through the pandemic the same way without the dedication and extraordinary efforts shown by our teams during this period, and I\u2019m eternally grateful.It\u2019s not normal for a company of any size to be able to respond to something as discontinuous and unpredictable as this pandemic turned out to be. What is it about Amazon that made it possible for us to do so? It\u2019s because we weren\u2019t starting from a standing start. We had been iterating on and remaking our fulfillment capabilities for nearly two decades. In every business we pursue, we\u2019re constantly experimenting and inventing. We\u2019re divinely discontented with customer experiences, whether they\u2019re our own or not. We believe these customer experiences can always be better, and we strive to make customers\u2019 lives better and easier every day. The beauty of this mission is that you never run out of runway; customers always want better, and our job is both to listen to their feedback and to imagine what else is possible and invent on their behalf.People often assume that the game-changing inventions they admire just pop out of somebody\u2019s head, a light bulb goes off, a team executes to that idea, and presto\u2014you have a new invention that\u2019s a breakaway success for a long time. That\u2019s rarely, if ever, how it happens. One of the lesser known facts about innovative companies like Amazon is that they are relentlessly debating, re-defining, tinkering, iterating, and experimenting to take the seed of a big idea and make it into something that resonates with customers and meaningfully changes their customer experience over a long period of time. Let me give you some Amazon examples. Our Fulfillment Network: Going back to the pandemic, there\u2019s no way we could have started working on our fulfillment network in March 2020 and satisfied anything close to what our customers needed. We\u2019d been innovating in our fulfillment network for 20 years, constantly trying to shorten the time to get items to customers. In the early 2000s, it took us an average of 18 hours to get an item through our fulfillment centers and on the right truck for shipment. Now, it takes us two. To deliver as reliably and cost-effectively as we desire, and to serve Amazon Prime members expecting shipments in a couple of days, we spent years building out an expansive set of fulfillment centers, a substantial logistics and transportation capability, and reconfigured how we did virtually everything in our facilities. For perspective, in 2004, we had seven fulfillment centers in the U.S. and four in other parts of the world, and we hadn\u2019t yet added delivery stations, which connect our fulfillment and sortation centers to the last-mile delivery vans you see driving around your neighborhood. Fast forward to the end of 2021, we had 253 fulfillment centers, 110 sortation centers, and 467 delivery stations in North America, with an additional 157 fulfillment centers, 58 sortation centers, and 588 delivery stations across the globe. Our delivery network grew to more than 260,000 drivers worldwide, and our Amazon Air cargo fleet has more than 100 aircraft. This has represented a capital investment of over $100 billion and countless iterations and small process improvements by over a million Amazonians in the last decade and a half.Ironically, just before COVID started, we\u2019d made the decision to invest billions of incremental dollars over several years to deliver an increasing number of Prime shipments in one day. This initiative was slowed by the challenges of the pandemic, but we\u2019ve since resumed our focus here. Delivering a substantial amount of shipments in one day is hard (especially across the millions of items that we offer) and initially expensive as we build out the infrastructure to scale this efficiently. But, we believe our over 200 million Prime customers, who will tell you very clearly that faster is almost always better, will love this. So, this capability to ship millions of items within a couple days (and increasingly one day) was not from one aha moment and not developed in a year or two. It\u2019s been hard-earned by putting ourselves in the shoes of our customers, knowing what they wanted, organizing Amazonians to work together to invent better solutions, and investing a large amount of financial and people resources over 20 years (often well in advance of when it would payout). This type of iterative innovation is never finished and has periodic peaks in investment years, but leads to better long-term customer experiences, customer loyalty, and returns for our shareholders.AWS: As we were defining AWS and working backwards on the services we thought customers wanted, we kept triggering one of the biggest tensions in product development\u2014where to draw the line on functionality in V1. One early meeting in particular\u2014for our core compute service called Elastic Compute Cloud (\"EC2\")\u2014was scheduled for an hour, and took three, as we animatedly debated whether we could launch a compute service without an accompanying persistent block storage companion (a form of network attached storage). Everybody agreed that having a persistent block store was important to a complete compute service; however, to have one ready would take an extra year. The question became could we offer customers a useful service where they could get meaningful value before we had all the features we thought they wanted? We decided that the initial launch of EC2 could be feature-poor if we also organized ourselves to listen to customers and iterate quickly. This approach works well if you indeed iterate quickly; but, is disastrous if you can\u2019t. We launched EC2 in 2006 with one instance size, in one data center, in one region of the world, with Linux operating system instances only (no Windows), without monitoring, load balancing, auto-scaling, or yes, persistent storage. EC2 was an initial success, but nowhere near the multi-billion-dollar service it\u2019s become until we added the missing capabilities listed above, and then some.In the early days of AWS, people sometimes asked us why compute wouldn\u2019t just be an undifferentiated commodity. But, there\u2019s a lot more to compute than just a server. Customers want various flavors of compute (e.g. server configurations optimized for storage, memory, high-performance compute, graphics rendering, machine learning), multiple form factors (e.g. fixed instance sizes, portable containers, serverless functions), various sizes and optimizations of persistent storage, and a slew of networking capabilities. Then, there\u2019s the CPU chip that runs in your compute. For many years, the industry had used Intel or AMDx86 processors. We have important partnerships with these companies, but realized that if we wanted to push price and performance further (as customers requested), we\u2019d have to develop our own chips, too. Our first generalized chip was Graviton, which we announced in 2018. This helped a subset of customer workloads run more cost-effectively than prior options. But, it wasn\u2019t until 2020, after taking the learnings from Graviton and innovating on a new chip, that we had something remarkable with our Graviton2 chip, which provides up to 40% better price-performance than the comparable latest generation x86 processors. Think about how much of an impact 40% improvement on compute is. Compute is used for every bit of technology. That\u2019s a huge deal for customers. And, while Graviton2 has been a significant success thus far (48 of the top 50 AWS EC2 customers have already adopted it), the AWS Chips team was already learning from what customers said could be better, and announced Graviton3 this past December (offering a 25% improvement on top of Graviton2\u2019s relative gains). The list of what we\u2019ve invented and delivered for customers in EC2 (and AWS in general) is pretty mind-boggling, and this iterative approach to innovation has not only given customers much more functionality in AWS than they can find anywhere else (which is a significant differentiator), but also allowed us to arrive at the much more game-changing offering that AWS is today.Devices: Our first foray into devices was the Kindle, released in 2007. It was not the most sophisticated industrial design (it was creamy white in color and the corners were uncomfortable for some people to hold), but revolutionary because it offered customers the ability to download any of over 90,000 books (now millions) in 60 seconds\u2014and we got better and faster at building attractive designs. Shortly thereafter, we launched a tablet, and then a phone (with the distinguishing feature of having front-facing cameras and a gyroscope to give customers a dynamic perspective along with varied 3D experiences). The phone was unsuccessful, and though we determined we were probably too late to this party and directed these resources elsewhere, we hired some fantastic long-term builders and learned valuable lessons from this failure that have served us well in devices like Echo and FireTV. When I think of the first Echo device\u2014and what Alexa could do for customers at that point\u2014it was noteworthy, yet so much less capable than what\u2019s possible today. Today, there are hundreds of millions of Alexa-enabled devices out there (in homes, offices, cars, hotel rooms, Amazon Echo devices, and third-party manufacturer devices); you can listen to music\u2014or watch videos now; you can control your lights and home automation; you can create routines like \u201cStart My Day\u201d where Alexa tells you the weather, your estimated commute time based on current traffic, then plays the news; you can easily order retail items on Amazon; you can get general or customized news, updates on sporting events and related stats\u2014and we\u2019re still quite early with respect to what Alexa and Alexa-related devices will do for customers. Our goal is for Alexa to be the world\u2019s most helpful and resourceful personal assistant, who makes people\u2019s lives meaningfully easier and better. We have a lot more inventing and iterating to go, but customers continue to indicate that we\u2019re on the right path. We have several other devices at varying stages of evolution (e.g. Ring and Blink provide the leading digital home security solutions, Astro is a brand new home robot that we just launched in late 2021), but it\u2019s safe to say that every one of our devices, whether you\u2019re talking about Kindle, FireTV, Alexa\/Echo, Ring, Blink, or Astro is an invention-in-process with a lot more coming that will keep improving customers\u2019 lives.Prime Video: We started in 2006 with an offering called Amazon Unbox where customers could download about a thousand movies from major studios. This made sense as bandwidth was slower those days (it would take an hour to download a video). But, as bandwidth got much faster to people\u2019s homes and mobile devices, along with the advent of connected TVs, streaming was going to be a much better customer solution, and we focused our efforts on streaming. In 2011, we started offering over 5,000 streaming movies and shows as part of customers\u2019 Amazon Prime subscriptions. Initially, all of our content was produced by other studios and entertainment companies. These deals were expensive, country-specific, and only available to us for a limited period; so, to expand our options, we started creating our own original shows. Our early efforts included short-lived shows like Alpha House and Betas, before we had our first award-winning series in Transparent, and eventually created multi-year franchises in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, The Boys, Bosch, and Jack Ryan. Along the way, we\u2019ve learned a lot about producing compelling entertainment with memorable moments and using machine learning and other inventive technology to provide a superior-quality streaming experience (with useful, relevant data about actors, TV shows, movies, music, or sports stats a click away in our unique X-Ray feature). You might have seen some of this in action in our recent new hit series, Reacher, and you\u2019ll hopefully see it in our upcoming Lord of the Rings series launch (coming Labor Day 2022). We also expect that you\u2019ll see this iterative invention when we launch Thursday Night Football, the NFL\u2019s first weekly, prime time, streaming-only broadcast, airing exclusively on Prime Video starting in September 2022. Our agreement with the NFL is for 11 years, and we will work relentlessly over the next several years to reinvent the NFL viewing experience for football fans.This track record of frequent invention is not only why more sports entities are choosing to work with Prime Video, but also why so many large entertainment companies have become Prime Video Channels partners. Channels is a program that enables entertainment companies to leverage Prime Video\u2019s unique technology and viewing experience, as well as its very large member base to offer monthly subscriptions to their content. Companies like Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount, Starz, Corus Entertainment, and Globo have found that they\u2019re driving substantial incremental membership and better customer experience through Channels. While there is so much progress in Prime Video from where we started, we have more invention in front of us in the next 15 years than the last 15\u2014and our team is passionately committed to providing customers with the most expansive collection of compelling content anywhere in the world. This same sort of iterative invention can be applied to efforts supporting people and communities. Last summer, we added two new Leadership Principles: Strive to be Earth\u2019s Best Employer and Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility. These concepts were always implicit at Amazon, but explicit Leadership Principles help us ask ourselves\u2014and empower more Amazonians at all levels to ask\u2014whether we\u2019re living up to these principles.For example, more than a million Amazonians work in our fulfillment network. In 2018, we championed the $15 minimum wage (which is more than double the federal minimum wage), but haven\u2019t stopped there. We continued to increase compensation such that our average starting hourly salary is currently over $18. Along with this compensation, we offer very robust benefits, including full health insurance, a 401K plan, up to 20 weeks of parental leave, and full tuition coverage for associates who want to get a college education (whether they remain with us or not). We\u2019re not close to being done in how we improve the lives of our employees. We\u2019ve researched and created a list of what we believe are the top 100 employee experience pain points and are systematically solving them. We\u2019re also passionate about further improving safety in our fulfillment network, with a focus on reducing strains, sprains, falls, and repetitive stress injuries. Our injury rates are sometimes misunderstood. We have operations jobs that fit both the \"warehousing\u201d and \"courier and delivery\u201d categories. In the last U.S. public numbers, our recordable incident rates were a little higher than the average of our warehousing peers (6.4 vs. 5.5), and a little lower than the average of our courier and delivery peers (7.6 vs. 9.1). This makes us about average relative to peers, but we don\u2019t seek to be average. We want to be best in class. When I first started in my new role, I spent significant time in our fulfillment centers and with our safety team, and hoped there might be a silver bullet that could change the numbers quickly. I didn\u2019t find that. At our scale (we hired over 300,000 people in 2021 alone, many of whom were new to this sort of work and needed training), it takes rigorous analysis, thoughtful problem-solving, and a willingness to invent to get to where you want. We\u2019ve been dissecting every process path to discern how we can further improve. We have a variety of programs in flight (e.g. rotational programs that help employees avoid spending too much time doing the same repetitive motions, wearables that prompt employees when they\u2019re moving in a dangerous way, improved shoes to provide better toe protection, training programs on body mechanics, wellness, and safety practices). But, we still have a ways to go, and we\u2019ll approach it like we do other customer experiences\u2014we\u2019ll keep learning, inventing, and iterating until we have more transformational results. We won\u2019t be satisfied until we do.Similarly, at our scale, we have a significant carbon footprint. It\u2019s a big part of why we created The Climate Pledge a few years ago (a pledge to be net-zero carbon by 2040, ten years ahead of the Paris Agreement). We\u2019re making significant progress on this effort (we\u2019re committed to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025\u2014five years ahead of our original target of 2030, we have ordered over 100,000 electric vans to deliver packages, and have over 300 companies who\u2019ve joined us in The Climate Pledge). But, we have a different challenge than most companies given the diversity and intensity of our operations (including shipping billions of packages per year). We\u2019re committed to the challenge, but it will take relentless invention.We also are trying to increase the amount of affordable housing in the communities in which we have a large presence. Our more than $2 billion Housing Equity Fund that we started a year ago has already allocated $1.2 billion toward affordable housing initiatives in the areas around Washington state\u2019s Puget Sound region, Arlington (Virginia), and Nashville (Tennessee).A final quick example is Kuiper, our low Earth orbit satellite network that we\u2019re spending over $10 billion to build in the next several years. Kuiper will serve customers with minimal to no fixed broadband connectivity, changing access to information and resources for many communities (analysts estimate approximately 300-400 million customers globally are in this category). We\u2019re optimistic that there is a pretty good business model for us too, but we\u2019ll see\u2014and it\u2019s a real game changer for underserved families and businesses that will unfold over many years as we keep evolving its capabilities.\u00a0\u00a0This type of iterative innovation is pervasive across every team at Amazon. I could have given comparable examples in Advertising, Grocery, Gaming, Amazon Music, Amazon Care (our telemedicine offering), or Pharmacy, to name a few. All of these stories are still being written as we rapidly experiment, learn, and continue to try to make our customer experience better every day.If this approach sounds appealing, a natural question is what\u2019s required to get good at it? It\u2019s easier said than done, but here are some components that have helped us:1\/ Hire the Right Builders: We disproportionately index in hiring builders. We think of builders as people who like to invent, who look at customer experiences, dissect what doesn\u2019t work well about them, and seek to reinvent them. We want people who keep asking why can\u2019t it be done? We want people who like to experiment and tinker, and who realize launch is the starting line, not the finish line.2\/ Organize Builders into Teams That Are as Separable and Autonomous as Possible: It\u2019s hard for teams to be deep in what customers care about in multiple areas. It\u2019s also hard to spend enough time on the new initiatives when there\u2019s resource contention with the more mature businesses; the surer bets usually win out. Single-threaded teams will know their customers\u2019 needs better, spend all their waking work hours inventing for them, and develop context and tempo to keep iterating quickly.3\/ Give Teams the Right Tools and Permission to Move Fast: Speed is not pre-ordained. It\u2019s a leadership choice. It has trade-offs, but you can\u2019t wake up one day and start moving fast. It requires having the right tools to experiment and build fast (a major part of why we started AWS), allowing teams to make two-way door decisions themselves, and setting an expectation that speed matters. And, it does. Speed is disproportionally important to every business at every stage of its evolution. Those that move slower than their competitive peers fall away over time.4\/ You Need Blind Faith, But No False Hope: This is a lyric from one of my favorite Foo Fighters songs (\u201cCongregation\u201d). When you invent, you come up with new ideas that people will reject because they haven\u2019t been done before (that\u2019s where the blind faith comes in), but it\u2019s also important to step back and make sure you have a viable plan that\u2019ll resonate with customers (avoid false hope). We\u2019re lucky that we have builders who challenge each other, feedback loops that give us access to customer feedback, and a product development process of working backwards from the customer where having to write a Press Release (to flesh out the customer benefits) and a Frequently Asked Questions document (to detail how we\u2019d build it) helps us have blind faith without false hope (at least usually).5\/ Define a Minimum Loveable Product (MLP), and Be Willing to Iterate Fast: Figuring out where to draw the line for launch is one of the most difficult decisions teams must make. Often, teams wait too long, and insist on too many bells and whistles, before launching. And, they miss the first mover advantage or opportunity to build mindshare in fast-moving market segments before well-executing peers get too far ahead. The launch product must be good enough that you believe it\u2019ll be loved from the get-go (why we call it a \"Minimum Loveable Product\" vs. a \"Minimum Viable Product\"), but in newer market segments, teams are often better off getting this MLP to customers and iterating quickly thereafter.6\/ Adopt a Long-term Orientation: We\u2019re sometimes criticized at Amazon for not shutting much down. It\u2019s true that we have a longer tolerance for our investments than most companies. But, we know that transformational invention takes multiple years, and if you\u2019re making big bets that you believe could substantially change customer experience (and your company), you have to be in it for the long-haul or you\u2019ll give up too quickly.7\/ Brace Yourself for Failure: If you invent a lot, you will fail more often than you wish. Nobody likes this part, but it comes with the territory. When it\u2019s clear that we\u2019ve launched something that won\u2019t work, we make sure we\u2019ve learned from what didn\u2019t go well, and secure great landing places for team members who delivered well\u2014or your best people will hesitate to work on new initiatives. \u00a0\u00a0Albert Einstein is sometimes credited with describing compound interest as the eighth wonder of the world (\"He who understands it, earns it. He who doesn\u2019t, pays it\"). We think of iterative innovation in much the same way. Iterative innovation creates magic for customers. Constantly inventing and improving products for customers has a compounding effect on the customer experience, and in turn on a business\u2019s prospects. Time is your friend when you are compounding gains. Amazon is a big company with some large businesses, but it\u2019s still early days for us. We will continue to be insurgent\u2014inventing in businesses that we\u2019re in, in new businesses that we\u2019ve yet to launch, and in new ideas that we haven\u2019t even imagined yet. It remains Day 1.Sincerely,Andy JassyPresident and Chief Executive OfficerAmazon.com, Inc.P.S. As we have always done, our original 1997 Shareholder Letter follows. What\u2019s written there is as true today as it was in 1997.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo our shareholders:Amazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers, yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry.But this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.We have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without risk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.It\u2019s All About the Long TermWe believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital.Our decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise.Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making approach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers.We will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions.We will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically, to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns, and to step up our investment in those that work best. We will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures.We will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages. Some of these investments will pay off, others will not, and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case.When forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our GAAP accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows, we\u2019ll take the cash flows.We will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices (to the extent competitive pressures allow), so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long-term leadership investments.We will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture. We understand the importance of continually reinforcing a cost-conscious culture, particularly in a business incurring net losses.We will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long-term profitability and capital management. At this stage, we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving the potential of our business model.We will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees, and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash. We know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think like, and therefore must actually be, an owner.We aren\u2019t so bold as to claim that the above is the \u201cright\u201d investment philosophy, but it\u2019s ours, and we would be remiss if we weren\u2019t clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.With this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our outlook for the future.Obsess Over CustomersFrom the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy- to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer customers gift certificates, 1-Click shopping\u2120, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling.By many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:Sales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million \u2013 an 838% increase.Cumulative customer accounts grew from 180,000 to 1,510,000 \u2013 a 738% increase.The percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to over 58% in the same period in 1997.In terms of audience reach, per Media Metrix, our Web site went from a rank of 90th to within the top 20.We established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America Online, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy.InfrastructureDuring 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic, sales, and service levels:Amazon.com\u2019s employee base grew from 158 to 614, and we significantly strengthened our management team.Distribution center capacity grew from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet, including a 70% expansion of our Seattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in Delaware in November.Inventories rose to over 200,000 titles at year-end, enabling us to improve availability for our customers.Our cash and investment balances at year-end were $125 million, thanks to our initial public offering in May 1997 and our $75 million loan, affording us substantial strategic flexibility.Our EmployeesThe past year\u2019s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com\u2019s success.It\u2019s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, \u201cYou can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can\u2019t choose two out of three\u201d), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren\u2019t meant to be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build Amazon.com.Goals for 1998We are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments.We now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we\u2019ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it\u2019s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about what we\u2019ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.Jeffrey P.

From online classes to virtual graduation ceremonies, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed every aspect of their education. But for one 2022 grad\u2014Destiny Ogar, a senior at the Baltimore Leadership School for Young Women\u2014the challenges went beyond the classroom. In early 2020, as the pandemic began to rage, her mother was severely injured in a car accident.\u201cThe reality of life being short and precious was magnified,\u201d Ogar said. \u201cNot only was I in the emotional turmoil that we all experienced during the early days of the pandemic, I also held the responsibility of caring for my mother, all while transitioning to online schooling and feeling that separation from my friends.\u201dDespite all of the disruptions in her life, Ogar became even more achievement-driven, not losing her focus on academics and even pursuing virtual extracurricular activities, including a job-readiness program. Now, as one of the students selected to receive a $40,000 scholarship from Amazon Future Engineer, Ogar will attend North Carolina A&T State University in the fall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDestiny Ogar, one of the students selected to receive a $40,000 scholarship from Amazon Future Engineer.\n\n\u201cWithout this scholarship, I likely would not be able to attend my dream school,\u201d she said. \u201cThis scholarship will open doors for me and allow me to pursue a career in technology.\u201dAs a young Black woman, Ogar dreams of being a trailblazer. She knows all about the inequities of the tech industry, and she\u2019s determined to use her training in computer science as a tool for change.\u201cA lot of people may not enter this field because they don\u2019t see someone that looks like them,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople of color are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), so I hope that future generations of Black women will see themselves in me and as someone they can look up to.\u201dAmazon awarded $40,000 scholarships to 250 students in 2022, for a total of $10 million, more than double the company\u2019s commitment from previous years. Scholarship recipients will also receive a paid internship at Amazon after their freshman year of college to gain hands-on, practical work experience with mentorship from Amazon leaders. Since 2019, Amazon has awarded $22 million in scholarships through Amazon Future Engineer\u2014our global philanthropic education program\u2014to 550 U.S. high school seniors from underserved and historically underrepresented communities. Amazon Future Engineer selects recipients based on academic achievement, demonstrated leadership, community involvement, work experience, future goals, and financial need. This year\u2019s recipients come from more than 30 states and U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico and, for the first time, an American military base in Europe. More than 70% of scholarship recipients identify as Black, Latinx, and Native American, and 50% identify as women, groups that are currently underrepresented in STEM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology powers art and social equity at AWS and beyond\n\nLearn more about girls and women who are working with tech and find out how AWS customers are innovating to increase gender equality.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother Amazon Future Engineer Scholarship recipient, Victor Acuna, a senior at Marco Antonio Firebaugh High School in Lynwood, California, shares Ogar\u2019s determination to help students understand the many pathways available to them and build the confidence to pursue those careers.At 12 years old, Acuna watched a sci-fi movie about computer programming and was immediately inspired, seeing the role of a programmer as an opportunity to shape the future. He researched computer science opportunities and was disheartened to find limited access to STEM programs in his community. To help drive change, Acuna created United We Code, an after-school computer science program that teaches elementary school students in his district how to code using Scratch, a coding language with a simple visual interface.\u201cOn my last day of teaching this semester, two students said they loved computer science and wanted to become coders,\u201d Acuna recalled. \u201cFor me, this confirmed that it isn\u2019t that people of color aren\u2019t interested in STEM, but rather, there aren\u2019t enough resources in place to offer people like me access to computer science opportunities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Acuna, one of the students selected to receive a $40,000 scholarship from Amazon Future Engineer.\n\nAcuna, who is the oldest of four siblings and a first-generation college student, will begin his freshman year at the University of California, Los Angeles in the fall, majoring in computer science and minoring in Chicano studies to learn more about Mexican culture and Indigenous languages. He hopes to build a career contributing to the development of devices people use every day and plans to stay involved with United We Code to help students see themselves and their futures in computer science careers.\u201cI would love to teach kids from my community more programming languages, like C++, which can be applied to real-world jobs,\u201d Acuna said. \u201cI want to expose people to programming languages that I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to learn at a young age, to inspire them and help increase the number of people of color in STEM.\u201dKey findings from a recent Gallup survey confirmed that a majority of students across the U.S. are interested in computer science, but many lack access to such classes in their schools and general exposure to the tech sector. The study also highlights that students who strongly agree they have computer science role models are 10 times more likely to say they will pursue a computer science career than students who strongly disagree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon, Pharrell, and Georgia Tech launch 2022 remix competition \n\nThe \u201cYour Voice is Power\u201d competition allows students to sound off about social justice\u2014by coding music remixes.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThese two students exemplify how access to computer science education helps enable the self-expression and problem-solving abilities of young people today,\u201d said Victor Reinoso, global director of Amazon\u2019s philanthropic education initiatives. \u201cI\u2019m inspired by their pursuit to broaden people\u2019s imagination and understanding of what happens in tech and the variety of roles that exist across the industry.\u201dComputer science is the fastest-growing profession within the STEM field. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that job opportunities for computer science workers will grow 13% between 2020 and 2030, yet only 8% of STEM graduates earn a computer science degree, and only a small percentage of those come from underserved and historically underrepresented communities. Additionally, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the median annual wage for computer and information technology occupations was $91,250 in May 2020, which is more than twice the median annual wage for all occupations.Amazon Future Engineer aims to bridge the divide between interested students and access to computer science courses and opportunities. In addition to its scholarship and internship program, Amazon Future Engineer gives elementary, middle, and high school students from diverse communities around the globe access to computer science education where they can explore project-based learning initiatives, using code to make music, program robots, and solve problems.Congratulations to the Amazon Future Engineer Scholarship Class of 2022.

For example, did you know Amazon's paper padded mailer offers the same recyclability as our corrugated boxes? Amazon has also invested $10 million in the Closed Loop Infrastructure Fund. Since its launch in 2018, the Fund has improved recycling access for 4.2 million households, kept 2.6 million tons of recyclable material in circulation, and avoided 5.7 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, Amazon is working to address plastic pollution, joining a consortium under the U.S. Department of Energy to spur innovation and advance new technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon teams are working hard every day to invent, create, and collaborate with each other and business partners to help the company become more sustainable. Taking action, together\u2014The Climate PledgeAmazon and more than 300 other companies are now committed to reaching net-zero carbon by 2040. Since 2019, The Climate Pledge\u2014which was co-founded by Amazon and Global Optimism\u2014has grown to include hundreds of companies like Microsoft, PepsiCo, and Visa that have all committed to work together and take bold steps to decarbonize and fight climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding coalitions to accelerate our decarbonization effortsIn 2020, Amazon helped to launch a series of initiatives that will help us and other companies make progress to reach net-zero carbon by 2040. We co-founded the Cargo Owners for Zero Emission Vessels network alongside the Aspen Institute, which aims to transition ocean freight vessels from fossil fuels to zero-carbon fuels by 2040. We also participated in the launch of The First Movers Coalition, which targets emission reductions in aviation, ocean shipping, steel, and trucking. Finally, we led the creation of the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance Aviators Group, which is focused on accelerating the transition to net-zero emissions air transport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in others\u2014The Climate Pledge Fund In 2020, Amazon launched The Climate Pledge Fund with an initial $2 billion in funding to help support visionary companies whose products and services will help businesses reach net-zero carbon to fight against climate change. So far, Amazon has invested in 13 innovative companies that include Amogy, a New York-based technology startup developing an ammonia-to-power system that is emission-free at the point of use. The system may eventually be used to power heavy-duty transportation, such as cargo shipping. Another company supported by the fund is ION Energy, an India-based startup that develops software to improve the life and performance of lithium-ion batteries that power electric vehicles and energy storage systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectrifying our fleetAmazon is committed to electrifying its delivery fleet. Amazon ordered 100,000 custom electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, marking the largest order ever of electric delivery vehicles, with all 100,000 vehicles planned to be on the road by 2030. Plus, Amazon has put over 15 different models of electric vehicles on the road, including custom delivery vehicles, e-cargo bikes, and e-rickshaws, to test and learn across the U.S., the European Union, and India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowering operations with renewable energyAmazon is on a path to powering its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of the initial 2030 target. In 2020, Amazon became the first consumer electronics company to commit to addressing the electricity used by Amazon-branded devices through renewable energy development, starting with Echo devices. We are making investments in additional wind and solar farm capacity that, by 2025, will produce the clean energy equivalent to the use of all Echo, Fire TV, and Ring devices worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmart packagingAmazon uses machine learning algorithms to arrive at the best possible packaging choices for deliveries. That means identifying which products don\u2019t need additional packaging and which smaller products are suitable for flexible packaging, such as padded mailers and bags that are up to 75% lighter than similar-sized boxes. As a result, Amazon has reduced the weight of outbound packaging per shipment by 36% and eliminated over 1 million tons of packaging material since 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking our buildings more sustainableAmazon Fresh announced that its newest Seattle store is the world\u2019s first grocery store pursuing Zero Carbon certification from the International Living Future Institute. Through more than a dozen design upgrades and features, the store is expected to save nearly 185 tons of CO2 each year when compared to an industry-standard grocery store. Additionally, Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle is slated to become the first arena in the world certified as net-zero carbon, and Amazon\u2019s buildings across its headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, will be powered by 100% renewable energy. The HQ buildings are also designed to achieve LEEDv4 Platinum certification, the highest green building certification from the U.S. Green Building Council.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about Earth Month at Amazon.\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nSustainabilityThe Climate PledgeRecyclingEarth Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            A look at Amazon\u2019s sustainability efforts this Earth Month\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","22":"\n\n\nOut of a job, worried he'd lose everything, Simmons Jr. applied for a job at Amazon\u2014only to find a new career. \n\nFrank Simmons Jr.\u2019s career path wasn\u2019t always clear before landing at Amazon.

I use Echo Dots in my clinic and ask Alexa to play white noise, so I can keep my patients calm without taking my attention away from them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018I was so grateful to have Alexa within earshot\u2019\n\nLearn how Alexa helped this customer call for help.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other thing I use Alexa for in my clinic deals with some of the day-to-day realities of owning a small business. In a vet clinic, there are always supplies that need to be bought\u2014bandages, trash bags, cleaning supplies. With Alexa, I manage my shopping lists for the clinic and order via Amazon from the Echo devices around the clinic.Quite recently I was reminded just how important Alexa was to me\u2014I was performing surgery on my own cat, Parka. Anyone with pets would know just how precious he is to me, and when I was doing surgery, I suddenly realized I needed more information from my husband, Henri, about Parka. With cats, it\u2019s important to minimize the time they spend under anesthesia, so I didn\u2019t want to waste any time. I called out to Alexa during Parka\u2019s surgery and dropped in on Henri, who was in his office at home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenri was able to answer all of my questions straight away, and I was able to move ahead with the surgery without stepping out of the operating suite or pausing the surgery once. Thanks to Alexa, Parka was out of surgery and back on the mend in no time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re glad to hear Parka is on the road to recovery!

Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online (SUCHO) was founded days after the conflict began, with a mission to identify and archive irreplaceable data and content from Ukrainian cultural heritage websites. To help accelerate the work, Amazon Web Services (AWS) joined the effort.Realizing that most cultural websites were hosted in physical locations in Ukraine that could come under attack, co-organizers Sebastian Majstorovic from the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage, Quinn Dombrowski from Stanford University, and Anna Kijas from Tufts University devised a way to quickly capture and archive these important digital assets. They formed the nonprofit SUCHO collective and rapidly enlisted and trained more than a thousand global volunteers. The team began using the open-source web archiving tool Webrecorder to replicate the website data of thousands of Ukrainian museums, libraries, digitized collections, and exhibits. In their work, the SUCHO team has saved important cultural assets such as scanned historical documents, audio recordings, scientific articles, and digitized artworks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online\n\nAs a grassroots project, SUCHO initially operated on a network of their volunteers\u2019 personal computers. AWS worked with SUCHO and Webrecorder to use services like Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) and AWS Fargate to scale up the web archiving process in the AWS Cloud. So far, the project has archived more than 25 terabytes of data from over 3,000 websites, with many of the websites going offline shortly after SUCHO was able to back them up.\u201cDue to AWS\u2019s support, we were able to quickly scale up and enable our volunteers to capture and preserve many important digital artifacts, saving thousands of cultural heritage sites from extinction,\u201d said Majstorovic. \u201cTechnology can empower volunteers in crisis relief efforts. Preserving historical data from sites like the National Chernobyl Museum and the State Archive of Kharkiv is just one example. We sincerely hope that most of the backups we produce will never be needed, but we are going to continue to archive as much digitized Ukrainian heritage as we can, just in case.\u201dStarting today, the growing SUCHO web archive is available by the AWS Open Data Sponsorship Program, which covers the cost of storage for publicly available, high-value, cloud-optimized datasets. Details on accessing the archive can be found at the Registry of Open Data on AWS.AWS recently committed $15 million in cloud computing credits, and technical expertise, to help organizations like SUCHO. We will continue to support local and global nonprofit, government, and commercial customers who request assistance to address this humanitarian crisis.Learn more about what Amazon is doing to support people in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nUkraineAWSCommunity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            Digital Ukrainian artifacts saved by cultural heritage professionals using AWS \r\n\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","25":"\n\n\nAmazon customers can now use their voice to plant trees around the world.\n\nIn celebration of Earth Month, Amazon is teaming up with One Tree Planted, an environmental charity that supports reforestation around the world.

With robots roaming the floor, software engineers like Swati Singhal work to avoid congestion and ensure coordination among the robots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe build full-scale 3D simulations that allow us to prototype new fulfillment centers,\u201d said Singhal. \u201cThese simulations allow us to loop in the software responsible for deciding the motion of the robots. That way, we can identify bottlenecks, so by the time the new fulfillment center opens, it works efficiently, without unexpected problems with the flow of robotic operations.\u201dA graduate of NSUT, Delhi in India, Singhal moved to the U.S. to earn a master\u2019s degree in computer science from Northeastern University in Boston. Despite being nervous about the transition, she credits her U.S. education in helping her in her career at Amazon.\u201cI was surprised how hands-on my experience at Northeastern University was. We were developing projects with people in multiple groups, but I think that helped with our soft skills as much as our technical skills,\u201d said Singhal.Singhal now collaborates with large teams that include systems and solutions architects, as well as hardware and software engineers. Her job is to build the model and write the code for the simulation\u2014and she led a key project to improve the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDoing these kinds of simulations used to be very inefficient. It would take a long time to manage, and there were a lot of opportunities for failure,\u201d said Singhal. \u201cOur team was able to make it easier to launch a large number of simulations\u2014hundreds, in fact\u2014all at the same time. And we made it so they could be managed automatically, with the results being easily downloadable. It\u2019s made a huge difference.\u201dNow, more than six years into her career at Amazon, Singhal continues to feel inspired by the company culture.\u201cThe Leadership Principles are very important. They aren\u2019t just words on a page\u2014people really live them,\u201d said Singhal. \u201cIn particular, I like how employees are encouraged to take ownership of a project from design to completion.

Often, it\u2019s something that\u2019s never been done before. It\u2019s a fun job. We\u2019re building something very exciting,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchubert works on Prime Air, where she\u2019s responsible for creating drone traffic management software. The work brings together her background in aerospace robotics and her interest in autonomous systems.\u201cThe Prime Air drones are autonomous. To fly safely, they need some ground station support,\u201d said Schubert. \u201cWhat we do is essentially build a map of the area and use it to plan a detailed route that helps the drone get to its destination safely.\u201dBefore working on Prime Air drones, Schubert earned her doctorate degree in aeronautical and astronautical engineering at Stanford University and spent years focusing on other Amazon devices, including Amazon Astro\u2014an autonomous robot that relies on the sophisticated software her team built to help it move around a customer\u2019s home while sensing and avoiding obstacles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Amazon Prime Air drone prototype\n\n\u201cAutonomy is a burgeoning space, with a lot of people trying to solve the same problems. For us, this is about using robot motion to provide value to customers and communities. That\u2019s what\u2019s great about working at Amazon on Prime Air; it\u2019s a terrific project both in terms of technical innovation and customer value,\u201d said Schubert.That value extends beyond the customer to the planet, as Schubert points out, because Prime Air drones are battery powered.\u201cAmazon is a special place because our work with autonomy is going to help build better customer experiences,\u201d said Schubert. \u201cThese are tough problems to solve, but we are figuring it out. We don\u2019t just go away and do research\u2014we combine research with development to reach a goal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA drone program taking flight\n\nAmazon moves closer to its goal of a drone delivery solution that scales to meet the needs of customers.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing up in a small town in Oregon, Schubert never imagined that she\u2019d end up developing autonomous air traffic controls for delivery drones, but she has good advice for anyone interested in robotics.\u201cRobotics is multidisciplinary,\u201d she said. \u201cThink about what you\u2019re interested in\u2014electrical engineering or hardware or something else\u2014and combine it with software. Software is important to everything we work on in robotics.\u201dSchubert is clear that it\u2019s also important to have diverse interests.\u201cIf you want to join a robotics team in your neighborhood, that\u2019s great. It\u2019s also okay to play an instrument or have other interests,\u201d said Schubert. \u201cAs the numbers and types of robots in our lives increase, it\u2019s critical that we have people thinking about how they interact with us, and that requires a totally different skill set to what you might imagine for a roboticist.\u201dAs someone who graduated at a time when robotics jobs were scarce, Schubert is optimistic about the future of her rapidly growing industry.Meet the other Amazon roboticists being spotlighted in our National Robotics Week series and explore jobs working with Prime Air.\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nRobotics EmployeesInnovation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            Safely introducing drones to our skies\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","31":"\n\n\nMeet Jon Stevens, a principal engineer working on Scout, and one of the roboticists we're spotlighting during National Robotics Week.\n\nJon Stevens is clear about what motivates his work with Amazon Scout.\u201cI remember as a child getting a kid\u2019s guide to robotics from the library. It taught me how to make a robotic finger out of a couple of straws and some string. Even though it was pretty basic, I was amazed at being able to create something that had movement and life to it\u2014that was a reflection of us as creatures,\u201d said Stevens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStevens went on to study kinematics and dynamics in college, which is where his curiosity evolved into the beginnings of a career.On graduation, he landed a job at Segway, where he started by working on vehicle dynamics. While working in his role, he also managed to learn about embedded programming, software, analog electronics, motors, and batteries. Everything that makes an electrically propelled vehicle. When Stevens was working on the balancing and steering controllers of Segway, he recognized what would become a key interest for him.\u201cI realized that it was about an interface and the ability of people to interact with machines. That\u2019s where I found my passion,\u201d said Stevens. \u201cNot just in building robots or robotic systems, but things you could interact with dynamically. It became a major theme in what I like to do. I have spent a lot of time thinking about how people interact with devices.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                \u201cThere\u2019s a great synthesis between art and technology. They\u2019re both highly creative.\u201d\n            \n\nJon Stevens\nPrincipal engineer\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the Scout team, Stevens\u2019s instinct to build robots that enhance the human experience has never left him.\u201cTechnology should be delightful. We want people to welcome Scout into the community and for it to be everything it could be. That means that it needs to be a good pedestrian and yield and be courteous, and my work on locomotion contributes to that.\u201dThe concept of robotics improving and augmenting our lives is a big part of Stevens\u2019s philosophy that good robots should give people better tools to work with. Tools that build our own strengths, in the same way computers strengthen analysis and calculation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier in his career, Stevens developed electric bikes with the idea of technology complementing humanity.\u201cAt Superpedestrian, we wanted to use robotics to augment the rider experience. Our theory was that you shouldn\u2019t feel like a human riding an e-bike; you should feel like a superhuman riding a bike. That\u2019s what we wanted the experience to be,\u201d he said.With this kind of enthusiasm and ambition for the potential of robotic technology, Stevens also found himself among the Imagineers at Walt Disney for some years. Working with the ride systems group, he pursued his love of enhancing things that move\u2014this time for the enjoyment of thrill-seekers.Stevens worked with creatives at Disney who wanted each attraction to tell a story. He also worked with ride animators who translated the stories into motion, and hardware engineers who built vehicles with the capabilities to express what the creatives wanted. He admits that he\u2019s had a particularly fun set of experiences as a person in technology.\u201cOn one project, we wanted to do some experiments on how to mimic the feeling of being in a car chase, because you have to understand how that feels,\u201d said Stevens. \u201cI got sent out into the desert north of Los Angeles to learn how to drift in a real car with experts. We also gathered data, so we could translate those experiences into the ride vehicles we were developing. We did experiments on vehicle capability and how they felt in reality.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for Amazon Scout?\n\nThousands of smiles into its journey, Amazon Scout rolls further into the future.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his current role working on Scout, Stevens enjoys combining this passion for experimentation with real-world problem-solving. In fact, he was initially drawn to the opportunity to solve the \u201clast mile problem\u201d with a lightweight electric propulsion vehicle. He also wanted to learn about Amazon\u2019s Leadership Principles from within and see firsthand how they are being used effectively in a big company.\u201cI came here to work on robotics and to work with the great people we have at Amazon,\u201d said Stevens. \u201cIn robotics, you don\u2019t do anything alone. It takes a team with diverse skills and perspectives, shared passions, and a bit of courage to tackle the unknown.\u201dWhen it comes to advice for budding roboticists, Stevens says to keep your eyes open, be curious, and take risks.\u201cI don\u2019t think I planned to work anywhere I\u2019ve worked,\u201d he said. \u201cI was drawn along by my interests, what I wanted to learn, and who I wanted to be with. When you align your passions and your interests with what you\u2019re doing, the hard work becomes meaningful.\u201dA creative who enjoys art and music outside of work, Stevens also stresses that robotics isn\u2019t all about the application of rules. It\u2019s more creative than people think.\u201cThere\u2019s a great synthesis between art and technology. They\u2019re both highly creative,\u201d said Stevens. \u201cRobotics isn\u2019t all science and engineering. It spans multiple domains. As robots get more exposure among the public, disciplines like industrial design and experience design will become even more core to the process of bringing robots to life.\u201dMeet the other Amazon roboticists being spotlighted in our National Robotics Week series and explore jobs working with Amazon Scout.\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nInnovationRobotics Employees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            Improving customer experiences with Amazon Scout\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","32":"\n\n\nMeet Lisa Huang, a senior embedded software engineer working on Scout, and one of the roboticists we're spotlighting during National Robotics Week.\n\nSenior Embedded Software Engineer Lisa Huang, now based in the UK, began her Amazon career working on processors for Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers. After focusing her work on networks for more than a decade, five years ago, Huang began to crave a new challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrincipal engineers at the company pointed out that one benefit of being at Amazon is that you can move around. They encouraged Huang to talk to different teams. \u201cI\u2019d never thought about that,\u201d said Huang. \u201cI felt really fortunate that I had these people pushing and inspiring me.\u201dScout was only the second team Huang spoke with, and while she\u2019d never worked on robotics before, she learned they had a need for her operating systems (OS) skills. Huang\u2019s OS knowledge was fundamental to Scout\u2019s hardware\u2014and with that job change, she got her start in robotics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet Scout\n\nField testing a new delivery system with Amazon Scout. \n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time, fall 2017, Scout was in the early stages of development.\u201cIn the early days, we were still trying to prove the concept. In 2019, after a couple years of development and many simulations, Scout delivered its first package. I remember the team feeling so proud when the device unhesitatingly paused to avoid a curious cat that had followed it down the street and then darted in front of its path,\u201d said Huang.In many ways, Huang\u2019s Scout work fits perfectly with her desire to work closely with hardware as a software engineer. When she was a high school student in Delaware, she enjoyed figuring out how things worked. This initially led her to consider both mechanical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.\n\n\n\n\n                \u201cA job like this is great for people who are naturally curious and like breaking problems down and solving them piece by piece.\u201d\n            \n\nLisa Huang\nSenior embedded software engineer\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of her first year in college, she figured out that her future would be more on the software side.\u201cSecond semester physics just didn\u2019t click for me. I didn\u2019t find it intuitive enough to follow a mechanical engineering path,\u201d said Huang. \u201cAt the same time, I really got into computer engineering and developing software, but I hadn\u2019t done any programming until I went to university, which is different from a lot of my colleagues who started writing programs when they were in high school\u2014and sometimes before.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuang\u2019s work in embedded software and operating systems for Scout now combines her two original interests, and she gets to work on broad multidisciplinary teams.\u201cThere\u2019s obviously the hardware, the mechanics, and the electrical components. The software\u2014where I work\u2014is a foundational component, and then there\u2019s the artificial intelligence and the behavioral aspects of it. With software, we\u2019re writing a smaller version of what our human brains do,\u201d said Huang.Amazon wasn\u2019t initially on Huang\u2019s radar when she graduated. She took a job at Cisco Systems and stayed there for 10 years, working in several areas, including device drivers and network protocols for the company\u2019s customer processors. When she was ready for a move, she considered different options.\u201cI was thinking about where to go next, but Amazon wasn\u2019t really on the list,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought of Amazon as a web services company, not a place where I\u2019d get to work with hardware.\u201dHowever, a good friend disagreed and thought Huang was perfect for a new role on the AWS networks team. After seeing her resume, the project lead was impressed with her experience.\u201cI got an email and then a call saying, \u2018I think you\u2019d be a great fit.\u2019 I thought I\u2019d be foolish not to have a conversation, so I went through the interview process and got an offer,\u201d said Huang.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Behind the scenes with Scout\n\nGet an inside look at one of the labs where the Amazon delivery devices are developed and hear from engineers and scientists working on this new technology.\n\n\n\n\nWatch now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow several years into her robotics work, Huang has been building a Scout team in Cambridge, UK. She\u2019s delighted she took the plunge. Her advice for anyone interested in working in the field is that they should \u201cgive it a go.\u201d\u201cTry things out,\u201d said Huang. \u201cStart in one domain of robotics and move around.

Six months later, I was offered an opportunity that was so exciting that I moved my family to Boston from Atlanta. Now, I have pictures of my kids playing in the snow. It\u2019s been a fantastic experience.\u201dBoateng\u2019s circuitous route to the Boston area\u2014one of the robotics centers of the United States\u2014led him to a critical role as a senior manager involved with control systems design and safety across Amazon\u2019s suite of fulfillment center robots.\u201cWe\u2019re just scratching the surface of how robotics can impact humanity. Whether that\u2019s eliminating activities that result in repetitive stress injuries or workflow, medical, or automation processes\u2014the diversity of application is exciting.

I was interested in working in high tech, but at the time, there was a hiring freeze. At a career fair, I decided to practice my interview skills with the recruiter, and ended up being offered a job on the spot.\u201dThe opportunity gave Boateng his first exposure to process control instrumentation, working at a large facility in New Orleans. In response to Hurricane Katrina, Boateng played a role in the plant recovery team. Boateng then shifted to actively developing and evaluating new technology\u2014as well as producing the standards and guidelines to make the tech safe. In this new phase of his career, he gained critical experience in high-risk facilities in countries including Angola and Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n                \u201cLearning, being curious, and exploring has been an integral part of my journey.\u201d\n            \n\nKobe Boateng\nSenior manager, controls system and safety\n\n\n\n\nHis work created a strong foundation for his role at Amazon, which he views as a way to transfer his skills into the world of robotics. He understands the importance of his work as he and his teams evaluate the breadth of technologies that are often synthesized into a single robotic solution.\u201cWe\u2019re not just tinkering over here,\u201d said Boateng. \u201cWe\u2019re solving problems in a company that is customer obsessed. We\u2019re always learning, and we\u2019re always pushing the boundaries.\u201dBoateng also takes pride in being able to build a team that has a high regard for the safety of people and is integral to the design of safe systems across Amazon.\u201cFrom the functional safety of the autonomous mobile robots to ensuring that any modifications to existing robots don\u2019t impact their safety integrity to the control systems for Robin, the manipulator arm\u2014we do it all. Anything that has any intelligence or electronics, my team supports it,\u201d said Boateng.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobin, one of the most complex stationary robot arm systems Amazon has ever built.\n\nAs a science enthusiast who excelled in math, physics, and chemistry at a young age, Boateng said the Amazon experience is rare, offering a unique immersion into the world of robotics.\u201cWe don\u2019t just design\u2014we also manufacture, and we deploy. So, you get to see the entire life cycle, and you\u2019re able to learn from how customers interact with the robots. That\u2019s incredibly valuable,\u201d he said.Boateng initially travelled to the U.S. to study engineering at Florida A&M when the lecturers in Ghana went on strike. He\u2019s now passionate about other Africans and Americans participating in cultural and educational exchanges. To that end, he is the founder of a program, African Diaspora Nation, that gives African students access to African and American universities and vice versa.The initiative encourages curiosity and open-mindedness among the next generation\u2014in particular, underrepresented youth. Boateng believes in the benefits of learning through new experiences.\u201cLearning, being curious, and exploring has been an integral part of my journey.

The discoveries were made by analyzing the molecular structures of a key \"protease,\" a large molecule responsible for regulating chemical reactions in the virus. With a deeper understanding of the molecule\u2019s unique structural characteristics, the researchers detected vulnerable areas of the protease and matched the weaknesses to two novel synthesizable compounds\u2014in other words, new potential medicines. If you think of the protease as an impossibly large skyscraper with millions of locked doors, AWS's suite of HPC systems allowed the researchers to sort through and find the correct keys to unlock new compounds and treatments at a pace far faster than in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScientists discover nine new coronaviruses in 11 days using AWS \n\nSupercomputer built on Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides world\u2019s most comprehensive open database on viruses that can potentially infect humans, to help stop pandemics before they start.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Previously, such efforts would have taken months, if not years,\" said Robert Marino, CEO of Qubit Pharmaceuticals, which collaborated with researchers from Italy, France, Switzerland, and Enamine, a chemistry company, to conduct the analysis and synthesis of the compounds. \"Now, we are able to make these discoveries in months.\" The compounds will go on to be tested in a preclinical environment, and their efficacy as a treatment or cure will be evaluated by regulators.Though the power of cloud computation is already impressive, Marino said the impact and ability of applying massive compute power to isolate new compounds and find new cures will only increase over the next five to 10 years. Much of the medical and biological research community has its eye on the development of quantum computing, a form of computational processing that uses the variable states of quantum mechanics\u2014the forces within atoms\u2014to store information, rather than using traditional 1s and 0s to store bits.While quantum computing is in its early days, the ambition of researchers working at Qubit and places like the AWS Center for Quantum Computing at Cal Tech is to unlock the power of quantum computing to exponentially speed up computing tasks. The speed increases researchers anticipate for certain computing tasks are mind-bending. For example, a problem that a traditional supercomputer would solve in 10,000 years could, in theory, take a quantum machine mere minutes. In other words, solving problems that are essentially impossible with classical computing becomes possible when we move to the quantum computing realm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS launches new quantum computing center\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) Center for Quantum Computing opens new facility at the California Institute of Technology with the aim of building a bigger, more accurate quantum computer.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Marino, quantum computing's true value to medical research won't be as much the speed of processing as the degree of complexity a quantum computer can handle when solving problems. Biological molecules exist in mind-bogglingly intricate systems. Proteins, sugars, fats, DNA, RNA, and a host of chemical markers in between all interact, bend, change shape, split, and grow around each other. Additionally, researchers must understand the effects of temperature, pressure, salinity, and environmental variables that cause a molecule to change shape and property. Being able to map all these factors at one time and perform analysis\u2014instantly\u2014is where the future of medical research lies, said Marino. So far, only quantum computing suggests the power to handle that much data and computational cost.Still, the discovery of these two potential COVID-19 treatments relied on an impressive array of high-powered computing systems. The Laboratory of Theoretical Chemistry at Sorbonne University built the original map of COVID-19 in May 2020, as infections skyrocketed. They leaned on France's national supercomputing center and AWS services to perform the simulations and model the proteins that form coronaviruses.Further simulations were performed in the AWS Cloud with funding from special COVID-19 grants AWS awarded to accelerate treatments and cures for the disease. In addition, the research teams relied on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) with NVIDIA graphic processing units and EC2 On-Demand to scan through the vast chemical libraries, which indexed the potential cures; Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provided the researchers with scalable and encrypted file storage; and Tinker-HP, deployed on AWS, provided high-performance molecular dynamics software. Using these tools, the team could explore enormous data libraries and vet potential cures that might have previously been omitted due to time and cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud-powered diagnostic tools are critical to fighting COVID-19\n\nAWS to distribute $12 million in 2021 and expand scope of its initiative to fight COVID-19.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 is only one disease this HPC computing approach is targeting, Marino said. Qubit is also using its proprietary software with AWS's computing and analytics services to find potential cures for cancer and other critical diseases.\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nAWSInnovationCOVID-19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            AWS high performance computing helps find potential COVID cures\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","36":"\n\n\nWith new long-term launch commitments, Project Kuiper prepares for future satellite deployments.\n\nAmazon continues to deliver on its roadmap for Project Kuiper, a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite system designed to provide fast, affordable broadband to unserved and underserved communities around the world.

People would love it!\"Thiam wasn\u2019t yet a restaurant owner, but he was rising fast from his first job busing tables in New York City. He had started cooking favorites from his native Senegal for \"family meal\"\u2014the staff-only dinner served before customers arrived at the restaurant where he worked. It was a revelation to his co-workers. They'd tried just about everything New York had to offer but hadn't tasted the beautiful blend of flavors, ingredients, and cooking techniques that the ugliness of colonialism had carried to his native Senegal. There, on the northwest coast of Africa, influences from France, Vietnam, and Lebanon are folded into local culinary traditions going back millennia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThiam described a typical dish: \"The tomato broth has so much flavor.

Then there's fruitiness from tamarind, acidity from lime, chili, fermented conch that adds so much umami. It's a dish to die for.\"The great response from co-workers\u2014and the popularity of his dishes when they appeared as specials on the restaurant menu\u2014validated a belief Thiam had when he arrived in New York. \"When I first started in restaurants, NYC was called the food capital of the world, but Africa was the big absence,\" he said. \"I saw this as an opportunity.\"Maximizing the opportunity of that absence has since defined Thiam's career as a chef and an entrepreneur.

It was one of the ingredients he couldn't find in the U.S., and he believed it checked \"so many boxes\" that people around the world would embrace it.\"Fonio is the oldest cultivated grain in Africa,\" Thiam said. \"It's very nutritious, and it cooks in five minutes. It has a nutty flavor, and it's versatile because it's neutral. It takes the flavor you add but doesn't contrast with it. Also, when you look at climate change, we have this food system that uses crops that demand so much water. Fonio is drought-resistant and has deep roots that slow the advance of the desert by restoring the topsoil.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon customers have given Yol\u00e9l\u00e9's fonio an average of 4.4 stars.\"The great thing with Amazon is the user feedback,\" Thiam said. \"It really tells us where our customers are and what they think about our products.

With summer around the corner, Alexa is making it easy for customers to beat the heat, hands-free.Household fans play an important part in staying cool and comfortable during the hot summer months, and now customers can control their Vornado fans using their voice and Alexa. Once the fan is connected to an Alexa device, simply tell the fan to turn on and oscillate according to the speed setting of your choice. Or you can create an Alexa Routine that automatically activates the fan for you and turns it off when you leave.Unlock new experiences with Alexa Connect KitVornado\u2019s 660AE and OSCR37 AE electric fans work with Alexa with the help of Alexa Connect Kit, a service for device manufacturers that makes it easy to integrate Alexa into their products.For Vornado, Alexa Connect Kit helped open a new chapter of possibilities for the company\u2019s classic product lines by unlocking new customer experiences with smart technology and voice capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Alexa makes the Emerald Forest even more enchanting\n\nFor guests staying at Scott Harlan's treehouse or visiting his \"climb-in\" theater in Washington state, Alexa-enabled devices light a path through the woods, fire up the hot tub, and trigger a unique breakfast delivery.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe identified the significant role smart technology would play to enhance our customer\u2019s experience nearly a decade ago, but we also knew that when we launched a solution, it had to be seamless,\u201d said Vornado Vice President, Brian Cartwright who leads R&D and design. \u201cWe saw the opportunity to add Alexa to our products as a way to help us deliver comfort into people\u2019s lives easily and with as much versatility as possible.\u201dAlexa Connect Kit makes voice integration simpleVornado spent years reviewing the costs of developing smart solutions, but the company was unable to find an affordable option. The company was told it would take several years and a huge financial investment to get it right. Plus, additional investments in cloud services, new software, and security firmware would be needed to address bugs and stay up to date with changes in consumer technology.\u201cDepending on who you talk to, you can get a wide range of costs from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. We were basically stalled and couldn\u2019t make a case for that kind of investment,\u201d said Vornado Director, Greg Pease who leads R&D and engineering. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until Amazon approached us about Alexa Connect Kit that we saw a way to remove some of these barriers to entry.\u201dUntil recently, integrating smart technologies into everyday devices was limited by several hurdles. Adding voice to a product required device makers to develop new components with Wi-Fi and processing power, in addition to software that controls their functions and connectivity.Alexa Connect Kit simplifies the process with a compact module that enables cloud connectivity and voice control. It also includes the necessary back-end services so device makers don\u2019t have to write special networking or security firmware, set up and manage cloud services, or develop an Alexa skill or app. The Alexa service then allows customers to operate the device by relaying voice commands to Alexa-enabled devices or through the Alexa app.\u201cAlexa Connect Kit, and the expertise and functionality that came along with it, really empowered us to strategically get where we wanted to go,\u201d Pease said.New to building connected devices? Amazon can helpVornado\u2019s success with Alexa Connect Kit began in October 2020, when the company started parallel development on two new products. The goal was to launch the devices at the same time in early 2021, but supply chain issues stemming from the pandemic caused significant delays.\u201cI can say without reservation that we might have been a few more years out from launching if a solution like Alexa Connect Kit hadn\u2019t come around,\u201d Pease said.Paul Hegdahl, senior business development manager for Alexa Connect Kit, frequently works with product manufacturers facing similar difficulties. \u201cAlexa Connect Kit is designed to help device makers simplify connected product development and bring products to market quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cWith Alexa Connect Kit, we\u2019re invested in supporting them through the whole process, from concept evaluation to post-launch product support.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon Glow reinvents how kids connect with remote loved ones\n\nThe new Glow device helps increase the quality time kids share with remote family members and parents who are miles (or minutes) away from home. \n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter an initial meeting with Amazon in October, Pease was impressed by the speed of the development process. Vornado had been working with manufacturing partners that did not have the experience needed to integrate Alexa Connect Kit chips with Vornado\u2019s existing circuit boards, but Amazon was able to introduce Vornado to several alternative vendors to get the process started. \u201cThe way the team worked with us and helped us find partners to bring these products to life has just been absolutely phenomenal. It makes it so easy for us,\u201d Pease said.From there, Amazon coordinated the product development work with the manufacturing partner that was integrating the hardware, which allowed Vornado to take on more of a project management and quality assurance role. Within months, Vornado was ready to launch the 660AE\u2014the company\u2019s first voice-controlled product\u2014by July 2021. The Alexa Connect Kit-enabled oscillating tower fan, the OSCR37 AE, followed just two weeks later.Vornado was also thrilled to announce its products carried both Works with Alexa and Certified for Humans certifications. \u201cIt provides that extra layer of credibility for customers,\u201d said Cartwright. \u201cIt was a nice bonus on top of the other support we received from Amazon\u2019s business development and marketing team to promote our products.\u201dRecent sales of Vornado\u2019s new Alexa-enabled products have been \u201coutstanding,\u201d added Cartwright, and Vornado is excited about continuing to build great customer experiences. \u201cAlexa Connect Kit gave us the level of expertise we needed to be successful and allowed us to focus on doing what we do best\u2014it was a no brainer,\u201d Pease said.\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nDevicesAlexaInnovation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            \u201cAlexa, turn on my Vornado\u201d\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","41":"\n\n\nAlexa can now give you advanced notice on deals\u2014and even buy them for you.\n\nWe\u2019re always looking for opportunities to build new Alexa experiences that make our customers\u2019 lives easier and more convenient.

We are dedicated to supporting them so they can continue to grow their businesses while getting packages to our customers. There\u2019s been a lot of news about rising fuel costs across the country and the impact of those costs on transportation and delivery companies. We want to share more about how Amazon\u2019s existing fuel programs support our partners year-round, regardless of pricing fluctuations at the pump.Each year, we spend hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel cards and benefits for Amazon\u2019s line haul and delivery partners:Amazon Freight Partners, which are small business trucking companies that provide dedicated capacity to service Amazon\u2019s network needs, have all fuel costs covered under their existing partnership with Amazon.Small business freight carriers that use Relay (our service for freight carriers to book and haul available Amazon loads utilizing their free capacity) have a fuel surcharge covered by Amazon, which is based on weekly national averages published by the\u00a0U.S. Energy Information Administration for every mile that carriers drive. These freight carriers are also eligible to enroll in Amazon\u2019s fuel discount program, which provides access to pre-negotiated fuel discounts at leading diesel merchants and thousands of independent locations across North America.Delivery Service Partners have all fuel costs covered under their existing partnership with Amazon.Amazon Flex delivery partners earn over $26 per hour on average in the U.S., and we\u2019ve made several adjustments through pricing surges in impacted areas. In addition, we are launching a program to double the cashback on fuel purchases to up to 12% with the Amazon Flex Rewards Debit Card.We are continuing to closely monitor this situation to determine if we need to make future adjustments to support our transportation partners.

Every transaction is different, with different issues and personalities, and that makes the work exciting. I\u2019ve also had the opportunity to work with amazing people at Amazon\u2014colleagues, clients, and mentors\u2014who are extremely smart, hard-working, and dedicated to innovating for customers. It\u2019s the combination of those two things that has kept me doing this work at Amazon for 10 years. If you do work that excites you with people you enjoy working with, it makes all the difference.What has been the most exciting moment of your career?I would take it back to when I was flying to Austin, Texas for the announcement of the Whole Foods Market deal. This was the biggest transaction we had done, and in a very compressed period of time, and I was so proud of our team. The best part was, I was on a plane with spotty Wi-Fi and nowhere else to be, so I actually took the time to let it sink in and reflect on all that it took to get there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lucas Jackson\n\nWhat makes a good M&A deal lead?The best lawyers are creative problem-solvers for their clients. We\u2019re trying to use all the tools we have at our disposal to get an outcome that we and the other party are happy with. This is where diverse perspectives are invaluable.There was a recent study that showed there are few women lawyers leading M&A deals. What are your thoughts on the research?I read the study by professor Afra Afsharipour at UC Davis, and it certainly was disappointing to learn that few women have led the largest M&A deals over the last decade. Women now represent over 50% of students at law schools, and law firms are getting better in terms of diversity in the partnership ranks, but there still appears to be a lack of female leadership in this particular area of law. My team has followed a different trend, with women running point on high-profile deals like Whole Foods Market, PillPack, Ring, and MGM, but there is always more work to be done. We have a responsibility to use our success and scale for good, and we\u2019ll keep working to hire, promote, and support attorneys and legal professionals of diverse backgrounds and skillsets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen powering Amazon\n\nBuilding the future on behalf of Amazon customers.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is Amazon supporting the growth of M&A lawyers?We have smart business partners who value our partnership, and the breadth of Amazon's business means we have a lot of variety in the types of deals we handle. We\u2019re intentional about how we assign those deals to ensure team members have the diversity of work and experiences necessary to advance in their careers. Amazon\u2019s legal leadership is also working with the OnRamp Fellowship to support female lawyers rejoining the workforce. This is exciting because it provides an avenue for women to come back to legal roles, including roles in M&A, with the resources they need to achieve work-life harmony as they ramp up.\n\n\n\nDiversity Lab\u2019s Onramp Fellowship aims to bring 200 women back into the legal profession by 2025\n\nThrough \u201cOnRamp 200,\u201d returning lawyers who have taken career hiatuses are provided with one-year paid fellowships at leading legal organizations, including Amazon.\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite way to celebrate a successful deal?All acquisitions are a team effort, so I like to take time to do something fun to recognize the good work that made the deal happen. To mark the recent closing of the MGM acquisition, everyone on the team gathered for a celebratory post-closing lunch and we all wore T-shirts honoring some of MGM\u2019s classic movies!If you could meet anyone from any point in time, who would it be?Michelle Obama. She\u2019s so inspiring and she\u2019s also a lawyer. I admire what she stands for and what she brought to the table as first lady of the United States, making the role her own. She\u2019s a role model and somebody many of us look up to.What is one thing you wish you would have known at the beginning of your career?Early on, I didn't know about all of the things I could do with a law degree. Like a lot of people, I had a perception of what lawyers do based on what I\u2019d seen on TV, and that was oftentimes a picture of lawyers in courtrooms. While that is definitely an available avenue, there are so many other careers where having a law degree is useful, and I\u2019m glad I found a good match for my personality and skillset.What advice do you have for lawyers starting out in the M&A field?There\u2019s space for you. Don\u2019t be discouraged, even if you walk into a room and nobody looks like you. Things are changing, and there is a role for you.\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nEmployeesWomen in businessLegal\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCosette Jarrett\nCosette is a cat-crazy writer and content marketing specialist from Salt Lake City.

To help, Amazon has leveraged our expertise in logistics and mobilized employees and customers to donate to the Red Cross and UNICEF through our homepage in countries around the world. These initiatives were made possible by the Disaster Relief by Amazon (DRbA) team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Disaster Relief by Amazon head Bettina Stix\nPhoto by JORDAN STEAD \/ Amazon\n\nDRbA is the brainchild of Bettina Stix, an Amazon veteran who has been involved with leading the Amazon website teams in Germany and France. She has worked across the company supporting the product development for our international websites, driving worldwide customer service policies and knowledge management, leading product management for Prime benefits, and supporting expansion beyond delivery to launching Prime countries and technology. \n\n\n\n\n                \u201cWhat if we could look at our systems and capabilities at Amazon from a disaster relief perspective and leverage what has already been built for our core businesses for disaster relief, delivering a \u2018second return on investment?\u2019\u201d\n            \n\nBettina Stix \n\n\n\n\nWe sat down with Bettina to talk about DRbA, and learn more about how Amazon is working to make the world better prepared for the next disaster.How did you get the idea for Disaster Relief by Amazon? \u201cI was wondering what role to take on next after Prime. I was going through a personal crisis of sorts at the time\u2014my sister was terminally ill. In addition, my family\u2019s history has been affected by the displacements after the Second World War, and I valued the power of altruistic support from early on. My personal life, my background, and my work experience at Amazon led to an epiphany: what if we could look at our systems and capabilities at Amazon from a disaster relief perspective and leverage what has already been built for our core businesses for disaster relief, delivering a \u2018second return on investment?\u2019\u201d Our customers and employees have repeatedly expressed interest in helping people impacted by disasters with more than cash donations. Our customers have begun creating wish lists on Amazon to collect in-kind donations for humanitarian needs. Amazon.de (Amazon's German operations) had launched a campaign with the Red Cross to help Syrian refugees, while customers in India have created wish lists to help people impacted by the flooding in Chennai.How does DRbA leverage the power and scale of Amazon?We already invest immense resources into logistics, payments, and digital technologies that can be used to deliver a more effective response than many other companies could do. We could do so much better by preparing for a disaster just like we would for a product launch \u2013 working backwards from the victims as our customers, identifying the partner network to enable successful delivery, programmatically preparing and running operations, and above all, building it on top of the platform capabilities that Amazon provides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can Amazon do that no one else can?Our customers appreciate the wide selection and fast delivery at Amazon. In times of disasters, we are uniquely positioned to establish a quick ad-hoc supply chain to support relief efforts. For example, we sent our Prime Air planes with a full cargo load of humanitarian relief items to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. When the Red Cross needed sifters to help victims find their valuables in the ashes of their houses after the Northern Californian wildfires, we were able to provide them with that relatively rare item. And on top of this, we can give our customers the opportunity to contribute through direct cash donations from their Amazon account and purchases from curated lists. What have you learned from disasters to which Amazon has responded?There were two big positive surprises: The amount of support our team received from employees around the company who volunteered their skills; and the generosity from our customers who donated through Amazon more than $5 million in cash and in-kind gifts to the causes of the Red Cross and UNICEF. Knowing that we could enable others to help was what made me proudest.We would have loved to be of use to the efforts in many more ways, though effective help requires careful preparation and building relationships with those in charge of relief efforts. We continue to engage with authorities and relief organizations to explore how Amazon can do even more in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon opens Disaster Relief Hub in Atlanta for faster response to natural disasters   \n\nAhead of the 2021 hurricane season, Amazon donated and pre-positioned over 500,000 emergency supplies to help relief organizations respond to natural disasters in the U.S., the Caribbean, and Central America.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat has been the biggest challenge for DRbA?The biggest challenge has been the amount and rapid succession of unprecedented disasters. Our team worked around the clock from the moment Harvey was declared a Hurricane at the end of August to the beginning of November. The nature of our work makes scheduling and forecasting mostly unpredictable\u2014just like it is for our colleagues at the relief organizations. You can\u2019t respond to every crisis. How do you decide when and when not to act?If our employees are affected, if our customers care deeply, and if we actually have an effective way to contribute, we will respond.What\u2019s next for DRbA?Not unlike other teams at Amazon, we strive to continually innovate. In our case we continue to explore how further we can leverage Amazon\u2019s unique products and services for our cause. We had the privilege to collaborate with relief organizations at close range, and can now use that knowledge to create new ways to bring help to victims. \n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nDisaster Relief by AmazonAmazon AirCommunityDisaster relief \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            Supporting communities impacted by natural disasters and humanitarian crises\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","45":"\n\n\nThe new Glow device helps increase the quality time kids share with remote family members and parents who are miles (or minutes) away from home. \n\nAmazon Glow is here, and it forever changes the way kids stay connected with loved ones across the country or the city. Glow\u2019s projector creates a 19-inch, touch-sensitive space for little ones to enjoy hands-on activities while adults simultaneously\u2014and remotely\u2014join in the fun, with a free companion app available on a tablet or smartphone they already own. Through Amazon Kids+, kids can connect to remote loved ones on a Glow video call to play games, solve puzzles, create art projects, read books, and explore new digital adventures together. Glow blends the physical and digital worlds, creating an experience that feels like sitting side-by-side, and is designed to foster quality interactive time between children and loving adults.\n\nAmazon Glow reinvents how kids connect with remote loved ones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFamilies that had early access to Glow quickly embraced the \u201cpractically there\u201d experience and encouraged kids to enjoy time with pre-approved family members\u2014grandparents, aunts, uncles\u2014whether they lived across the country or across town. Glow can also help parents erase the miles when work requires that they miss important daily moments, like family breakfast, homework help, after-school fun, and bedtime stories.No more missed bedtime storiesParents wish they could tuck their children into bed each night\u2014but when that\u2019s not possible, they get creative. According to new research* 64% of parents surveyed said they used a virtual solution to stay in touch with their little ones, including video chats (45%), phone calls (44%), and texts (33%). But even those solutions are far from perfect.\u201cMore than half the parents we surveyed said their kids had trouble staying engaged during traditional video-chatting calls,\u201d said Joerg Tewes, general manager, Amazon Glow. \u201cThe Glow experience solves this, and is designed to let kids be kids in a world of animated games, vacuum erasers, scanning magic, and more that allows kids to do things with their parents rather than just listening.

This research inspired the new-to-world Glow experience that combines traditional video calling with an interactive, supersized, projected surface like no other that excites kids and delights grown-ups with all they can do together.\u201dAdults use their smartphone or tablet to access the free Glow app, while the child uses Glow\u2019s 19-inch, touch-sensitive projected space, which appears on the Glow mat. Glow is designed so that each person has a clear view of the other as they simultaneously engage in real-time activities.Introducing Glow to parents who travelGlow surprised a group of working parents who know the pain of being away from their families: long-haul drivers. These drivers, who on average spend two to three weeks away from their families at a time (according to CDL.com, a leading industry resource for U.S. trucking job opportunities), are often away from home for up to 300 nights a year\u2014meaning they may miss 300 bedtimes with their kids. These parents and kids were the first to be invited to the Glow mobile station to see Glow fun firsthand, and some were even provided a free Glow device for their family.\u201cLong-haul truckers know firsthand how challenging it is to stay connected with their children while on the road,'' said Tewes. \u201cWe decided to surprise families at the Mid-America Trucking Show to show these hard-working families how Glow can help erase the miles and make virtual together time more fun for everyone.\u201d\n\nAmazon Glow surprises long-haul drivers at the Mid-America Trucking Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mid-America Trucking Show in Louisville, Kentucky has brought together more than 70,000 truck drivers and their families to explore innovative new technology and connect with others in the industry.\u201cI\u2019m definitely not a traditional mom. I\u2019m on the road for four weeks at a time,\u201d said Marcia Luchenbill, an Army combat veteran and mother of three who has been a truck driver for the past two years. \u201cIt\u2019s calming to be on the road alone, but I miss real conversations with my family, cooking in the comfort of my own kitchen, and being able to cheer on my kids in their special moments.\u201dReady, set, Glow!Powered by Amazon Kids+, Glow has content featuring beloved characters from Disney, Pixar, Nickelodeon, Sesame Workshop, and Mattel\u2014and provides parents, aunts, uncles, family friends, and grandparents with fun ways to delight and teach the young ones in their lives.With an Amazon Kids+ subscription, kids can use interactive Glow calls to engage with loved ones on another device.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) technologies and experts have been supporting a range of activities, including powering applications that are facilitating the intake of Ukrainian refugees at border crossings, providing technology to help establish safe evacuation routes, setting up emergency internet connectivity, and enabling secure communications.We are working closely with international aid organizations like Help.NGO, which specializes in emergency response, by providing technology resources that are supporting refugee needs. We are also working with local Ukrainian organizations, such as Optima School, the country\u2019s largest distance learning school, to scale up and support the thousands of displaced students who now need access to online education.Because of the complexity of the work on the ground and the evolving security landscape, technology assistance can have an outsized impact on the success of relief efforts.

She saw the need to attract more women to technology careers when she joined the mentoring and training program AWS She Builds, which hosts events that support making tech more diverse. So she helped launch She Builds CloudUp, a program focused on helping women inside and outside of Amazon build cloud computing knowledge while also providing mentors and community, from both inside and outside of AWS. Demand for the program was so strong that it led her team to develop a second program to help prepare participants for the AWS Solution Architect Associate exam, which validates technical expertise in designing and deploying scalable, highly available, and fault-tolerant systems on AWS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging the conversation\n\nSee how AWS is building a workplace where more people can thrive so that we can build technology that works better for everyone.\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOver the past 12 months, we\u2019ve had tens of thousands of women register for these programs all around the world, showing how many women are in tech or interested in tech, and how important it is to provide these safe community spaces where women can learn together and have role models,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cWatching women join these programs and build their knowledge and confidence over the eight to 16 weeks is so rewarding and just makes me want to do more and more in this space.\u201dEdwards is surrounded by women across AWS who share her passions for continuing to increase women\u2019s representation in technology fields. Through employee community and affinity groups, women who work in technology roles at AWS are building more ways to advocate and inspire women and girls to follow a technical career path.\u201cIt is so important to form organizations and teams that have a mix of genders, backgrounds, and personalities so we have ideas that represent all of the communities and customers we serve,\u201d Edwards said.Inspiring and leading changeWomen hold about 26% of tech-related roles in the global workforce, according to Gartner Research.

The programs include AWS GetIT, which inspires young students to gain digital skills and consider a career in technology while also empowering women at Amazon and AWS to build more confidence and leadership skills to become greater role models and advocates for inclusion, diversity, and equity in technology. Another program is We Power Tech, which promotes diversity in tech through educational content, partnerships, and programs aimed at helping to support underrepresented tech talent globally.

Working backwards from refugee needs, Amazon teams assess what supplies they must donate directly, procure any missing items, and then consolidate, pack, and ship the supplies needed by charities to do their lifesaving work. Customers in Europe can donate to support these efforts through dedicated Wish Lists on Amazon\u2019s European stores.As these critical supplies come in to Amazon\u2019s European network, the Amazon Transportation Services team is shipping them to the new hub in Slovakia, where space is exclusively carved out for the relief efforts. Once the products arrive at the hub in Slovakia, the donated supplies are distributed to displaced refugees in partnership with charities including Save The Children and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The strategic location of the Slovakia humanitarian aid hub will significantly expedite the movement of relief supplies throughout Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, Moldova, and Czech Republic to quickly help Ukrainian children and families in need.Launching this hub in less than 10 days was a huge team effort, and it\u2019s gratifying to see much-needed supplies already flowing through and making their way to people in need. We\u2019re thankful to our customers for their generosity and to our teams and our partners for their work and dedication to supporting refugees at this critical time, and we know this will be a long-term effort.

It is also home to the data centers that power Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers\u2019 applications. Recycled water from these data centers irrigates hundreds of acres of land in the local area, helping farmers grow crops like corn, soybean, and wheat.\n\n\n\n\n                \u201cBesides the land we own, water is one of our greatest assets.\u201d\n            \n\nVern Fredrickson, local farmer and vice chairman of the Board of Directors for the West Extension Irrigation District\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s because five years ago, AWS and Umatilla community leaders worked together to develop a sustainable solution to recycle the water used to cool AWS data centers. The plan led to local municipalities and AWS investing in miles of new pipeline to deliver the water to existing canals, allowing 96% of all spent cooling water from AWS data centers to be reused in nearby communities. The plan also better managed the flow and availability of water for farming in the region and provided a new source of water for local farmers and residents. It marks the first time AWS has sent cooling water directly to an irrigation canal globally.\u201cBesides the land we own, water is one of our greatest assets. Every gallon is important to the community, especially for farmers like me,\u201d said Vern Fredrickson, a local farmer and vice chairman of the Board of Directors for the West Extension Irrigation District. \u201cWe\u2019re glad to see businesses like AWS working with local officials to send water back to the community.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure water quality is maintained in the reuse system throughout the irrigation season, AWS installed water quality sensors, AWS Internet of Things (IoT) gateways that transmit data from the sensors back to the cloud, and AWS IoT Core cloud services that capture the data for analysis and automated alarming. These IoT services provide both AWS and the surrounding communities with peace of mind that water quality is maintained and always suitable for irrigation. The water reuse system makes millions of gallons of water each year available for the first time to farmers and residents in Umatilla and Morrow counties.\u201cWe wanted to partner with a good water steward like AWS to help develop a more sustainable approach to how we manage and maintain our water sources,\u201d said Dave Stockdale, city manager for Umatilla. \u201cAlongside the growth in jobs and opportunities from AWS operating here, we wanted to ensure that there were no negative effects on our long-standing history of agriculture.\u201d\n\nAWS Helped this City Develop Sustainable Water Practices | Amazon News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe water we use is critical for cooling our data center servers, and although we use less than 1% of the freshwater in the region, we remain focused on minimizing our impact.

Home alone for the next few hours, Penny wondered how she would get the help she needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about what Penny did next, in her own words:A few months ago, I decided to paint my living room and had moved all the furniture around and removed items from the walls. Once the paint dried, it was time to put the room back together. I fixed all the furniture back into its usual place, and then tackled the curtain rod over the window. I figured the easiest way to do it was to climb up onto the back of the couch, but I forgot just how slippery that material can be!Next thing I knew, my foot slipped from the top of the couch, sunk into a cushion, and I hurt my leg as I fell back onto the living room floor. I was so shocked\u2014I laid there for a few moments trying to assess my pain and figure out what to do next. It was such a hard landing that I didn\u2019t want to move my leg because I was so sure it was broken.As I was lying there on the floor, I ran through my options. My cellphone wasn\u2019t within reach and I wasn\u2019t sure I could move to get it. My husband is a pilot, so he was away for days. My son wouldn\u2019t be home from his classes for hours.

I remembered that Alexa could call my contacts, and so I called out and asked Alexa to call my friend and neighbor Celeste.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt only rang a few times before Celeste picked up, and I was so relieved to hear her voice. Celeste definitely thought I was joking at first, but eventually she realized I was completely serious and she ran across the road to come help me out. She stayed with me on the line through Alexa the entire time, right up until she came in to get me. \u00a0I ruptured my ACL and was so grateful I\u2019d been able to get help when I did. Before the accident, I had been appreciative of how useful Alexa was in making my daily life easier, but this incident really reminded me how much safer it can help me feel.

So much has changed since we began construction more than two years ago in National Landing, and we can\u2019t wait to welcome Amazon employees and the Arlington community to Metropolitan Park in 2023.Since we announced Arlington as the site of HQ2 in 2018, we\u2019ve been committed to building an inviting space that benefits our employees and the entire Arlington community through our focus on nature, sustainability, and being great neighbors. The construction and design teams represent the diverse and vibrant economic impact this project is contributing to the local community. More than 4,800 skilled craftworkers and project managers are building Metropolitan Park and have devoted more than 2.2 million hours to this project. We appreciate their hard work and dedication.Our progress would also not be possible without the strong support of our partners\u2014Clark Construction, JBG Smith, ZGF Architects, and Seneca Group\u2014that share our commitment to the safe and sustainable construction of Metropolitan Park.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to making great progress on construction over the past two years, we\u2019ve built what we hope will be lasting partnerships across the community. With input from those partners, we\u2019ve invested in the community in a number of ways. For example, working closely with the Arlington County Board, we\u2019ve listened to local residents and included their feedback into the project, including over half a mile of new protected bike lanes, 2.5 acres of new and renovated public open space, and a daycare center for families in the neighborhood. Metropolitan Park\u2019s two 22-story office buildings will include more than 50,000 square feet of retail space for local small businesses and a 700-person meeting center that will be available to local community groups. The entire complex will also be powered by 100% renewable energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst local retailers sign on to open shops at Amazon\u2019s HQ2 \n\nDistrict Dogs and R\u0100KO Coffee are the first small businesses to sign leases at HQ2 as part of Amazon\u2019s pledge to bring local, minority- and women-owned retailers to its second headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. \n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2018, we have committed more than $34 million in total investments to local nonprofits, community groups, public schools, and businesses in the local community. This includes both monetary and in-kind donations, such as school supplies to public schools across Northern Virginia, supporting hyperlocal racial equity initiatives, and food donations to local food banks and pantries for families in need.These commitments are in addition to Amazon\u2019s announcement in 2021 to create the Amazon Housing Equity Fund. The fund aims to preserve existing affordable housing and to create inclusive housing developments through low-rate loans and grants to housing partners, traditional and non-traditional public agencies, and minority-led organizations. To date, we have committed over $795 million in low-rate loans and grants to create or preserve up to 4,400 affordable homes in the HQ2 region, with more investments to come. We\u2019re proud to share that, according to recent data provided by Arlington County, the Amazon Housing Equity Fund has increased the long-term committed multifamily affordable housing stock in Arlington by 22%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClark Construction raises celebratory concrete bucket signed by workers who are building Amazon\u2019s HQ2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClark Construction raises celebratory concrete bucket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon\u2019s director of Global Real Estate and Facilities, Joe Chapman, delivers remarks at the Met Park Topping Out Celebration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon\u2019s director of Global Real Estate and Facilities, Joe Chapman, and Clark Construction VP, Jeff King, shake hands at the Met Park Topping Out Celebration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArlington County Board Chair, Katie Cristol, addresses craftworkers and guests at the Met Park Topping Out Celebration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday\u2019s celebration is an important milestone, but in many ways it\u2019s just the beginning of our commitment to the Arlington community.

The story is part of Climate Next, a new AWS documentary series.\n\nOn average, low-income neighborhoods have about 15% less tree cover and are 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) hotter than high-income areas. This issue is called \u201cshade equity,\u201d a social and environmental justice concern focused on ensuring that shade is accessible in neighborhoods regardless of income, race, or ethnicity.In addition to providing cooling and reducing heat-related illnesses, evidence supports the premise that tree cover in cities provides significant health benefits for people, including lower levels of air pollution, better heart function, and improved mental health. Further, trees are one of the most cost-effective, nature-based solutions that can help us cope with the climate crisis. A California study found that every $1 spent on tree planting and maintenance in urban areas returns $5.82 in benefits.\n\nLos Angeles: Plant a Tree, Grow a Community | Climate Next by AWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cUrban areas are at the heart of the climate crisis, because that's where 80% of our North American population lives. If we want to reduce the impact of climate change on people's lives, we must consider how our cities are going to cope with the climate crisis,\u201d said Dr. Tanushree Biswas, carbon program director at The Nature Conservancy (TNC), a global conservation organization.The disparity in tree cover is largely due to a series of consecutive policies that were championed by local authorities and further codified through federal actions throughout the 20th century. As population and infrastructure rapidly grew during the early 1900s, decisions were made to disinvest in neighborhoods where people of color resided. The federal government codified these decisions during the 1930s in a series of laws that gave locally authorized segregation policies the needed legal authority. The federally backed segregation policies, commonly referred to as \u201credlining,\u201d divided residential neighborhoods and concentrated services, including the provision of green spaces, to wealthier and whiter neighborhoods. Communities deemed \u201chazardous\u201d or \u201cdeclining\u201d were left without green spaces and other social services. In recent years, cities have been losing approximately 4 million trees each year, or 1.3% of the total urban tree stock, and American cities spend less than .3% of municipal budgets on tree planting and maintenance.\n\n\n\n\n                \u201cNature is our best ally in resolving climate change.\u201d\n            \n\nDr. Tanushree Biswas\nCarbon program director at The Nature Conservancy\n\n\n\n\nPeople in urban environments are feeling the effects of this disinvestment. \u201cWe don't have a lot of trees. As a kid, I remember a lot of trees. I don't know what happened to them. They died off. People cut them down. I don't know. But it's similar to the food desert. It's a tree desert,\u201d said Joe Ward-Wallace, co-founder of South LA Cafe and South LA Market in South Central Los Angeles. \u201cWe need trees here\u2014it gets hot. It looks better when trees are around, and it makes people feel better.\u201dNumerous studies show the relationship between tree cover and local temperatures in urban areas. We know less about the logistic feasibility of increasing tree cover to mitigate urban heat and address disparities in urban green spaces. To address this gap, TNC uses data and Amazon Web Services (AWS). TNC combines and analyzes data from a variety of sources, including satellite-based measurements of tree cover, available plantable areas in cities, land surface temperatures, and socio-economic variables (like block group demographic-economic estimates), to understand the spatial feasibility of a city to support trees.In a statewide assessment of nature-based pathways that address the climate crisis, TNC showed that urban California has up to 1.2 million acres of space available for urban afforestation and could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by planting trees on 500,000 available acres in disadvantaged and low income communities. A follow-up statewide assessment by TNC shows that California cities have space available for an additional 34 million trees. It also identifies where tree planting is immediately feasible, and predicts how much the temperature and urban heat island effects could potentially drop with the planting of new trees. According to a recent study, this would reduce the average urban land surface temperature and provide multiple co-benefits totaling $1.1 billion annually\u2014including reduction in heat-related medical visits (more than 4,000 over 10 years) and 4.5 million metric tons of annual CO2 sequestration. In California, an annual investment of $467 million for urban afforestation using TNC's prioritization pathways will lead to $712 million of net annual benefits and serve 89% of the approximately 9 million residents in the lowest income quartiles of the state\u2019s cities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Next: How data and community can save Zanzibar\u2019s mangroves\n\nDigital Earth Africa is helping Zanzibar fight the effects of climate change and protect the island's precious mangrove habitat. The story is also part of a new documentary series, Climate Next.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe geospatial data and research is even more powerful when it\u2019s presented as a story. Esri ArcGIS StoryMaps\u2014an AWS-powered tool that combines text, video, charts, and advanced interactive geospatial visualizations\u2014does just that. TNC uses this tool to tell a story with its data and work with partners to make it actionable for local nonprofits and government agencies across various cities. Data stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and in Enterprise GeoDatabases like Amazon Aurora can be analyzed and brought into StoryMaps to show how a city changes over time. Using advanced Esri ArcGIS Server and Image Server tools running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) makes it fast and efficient to perform analysis and integrate the data in StoryMaps. In addition to displaying the geospatial data, StoryMaps organizes and styles the data to emphasize points in real-time complex illustrations.Once the data is translated into a StoryMap, TNC uses it as a tool to communicate with legislatures, policymakers, and stakeholders. For example, the entire Natural Climate Solutions (NCS) pathway report for California is available as a StoryMap. It provides easy access to maps and data, and contributes to an interactive user interface that shows possible opportunities for a multisector NCS intervention in the landscape. In addition, TNC can show opportunities for urban afforestation along with how it lines up with other climate mitigation pathways. This further assists conversations with policymakers, state agencies, and stakeholders.Following the completion of the NCS pathway report, TNC used the StoryMap to design a series of regional roundtable discussions with local and grassroots-level organizations across California to promote a bottom-up approach to understanding the barriers and challenges of implementing nature-based solutions in the region. They gathered folks from the urban, forest, and natural working land sectors to talk to each other, and identify barriers and solutions to using nature as a climate change solution. TNC also did a roadshow with its StoryMap, with state agencies, showing the potential opportunity of using nature across California to mitigate climate change. \u201cNature is our best ally in resolving climate change,\u201d said Biswas. \u201cStoryMaps helps us build the bridge to communicate science into action and take successful examples implemented locally to scale.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe map shows the tree canopy coverage at the census tract level as it relates to the redlined areas of Los Angeles. The places outlined in yellow and red represent areas that were deemed by the government as \u201cdefinitely declining\u201d and \u201chazardous\u201d communities, respectively. These regions experienced extreme divestment, which meant that there was a lack of financial support from governments and financial institutions to invest in the well-being of these communities. As a result, these communities have a lack of tree canopy coverage, as represented by the lighter color scheme.\n\nThe map shows the tree canopy coverage at the census tract level as it relates to the redlined areas of Los Angeles.This work is happening in real time in Los Angeles. The city has a tree equity goal as part of the Green New Deal directive led by Mayor Eric Garcetti. One of the key principles is to deliver environmental justice and equity by increasing the tree canopy by 50% in the areas of greatest need by 2028.To help reach this goal, City Plants, an organization based in Los Angeles, collaborates with TNC scientists to translate science into action and achieve outcomes on the ground. Together, they aim to grow a greener future by engaging Angelenos to plant and care for trees throughout the city. The organization uses TNC\u2019s science, research, tools, AWS technology, and actionable StoryMaps to help carry out an equitable tree-planting strategy in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis photo captures the clear lack of shade and tree cover on a downtown Los Angeles street.\n\n\u201cI really like to see how we can use the best available science and information to help inform the decisions on the ground. City Plants is by no means alone in that journey, but we get to take the work of tree planting prioritization that TNC is helping to define through mapping and other innovative tools, and apply it directly here in Los Angeles,\u201d said Rachel O\u2019Leary, executive director at City Plants. \u201cWhen we\u2019re faced with huge, ominous, harrowing, scary ideas and issues like climate change, I see tree planting as a vehicle to overcome a lot of that anxiety and grow solutions together.\u201dAWS Cloud services have been key to allowing TNC to store data, conduct research, and create actionable visualizations to make progress on its mission. Identifying space for additional trees is only a beginning step. While knowing where we can strategically increase tree cover and reduce shade inequity is an important step, much larger and sustainable funding mechanisms are needed. We must also ensure the maintenance of urban trees and scale efforts beyond individual cities. \u201cThe globe has to reduce its temperature, which means we have to work on something big. We have to really work together,\u201d Biswas said. \u201cWe have to think, \u2018What are the lessons that our partners have learned here that can be applied to other cities?\u2019 That\u2019s the power of cloud computing\u2014the exchange of human knowledge.\u201dAWS is proud to support innovation and nature-preserving organizations like TNC and City Plants, and will keep working to help future generations enjoy a tree-rich and sustainable environment.The AWS original four-part Climate Next documentary series features stories about people and communities around the world driving innovation and creating scalable solutions to address climate change.\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nSustainabilityAWSInnovation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            Climate Next: Using data to address tree cover and climate change\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","55":"\n\n\n\nThe storied, nearly century-old studio will complement Prime Video and Amazon Studios\u2019 work.

Calculation based on CO2e saved, using the EPA carbon calculator.\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nPhysical retailAmazon FreshThe Climate PledgeSustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            Amazon Fresh is on its way to net-zero carbon with newest store \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","57":"\n\n\nSmart farm solution built on Amazon Web Services helps small-scale farmers increase production of one of the country\u2019s most popular cooking ingredients.\n\nEvery day, for years, SangYoung Park, a farmer in Geumsan County, South Korea, spent a substantial part of his day going back and forth to his farm\u2019s five greenhouses to open and close the windows.If you think that sounds time-consuming and repetitive, you\u2019re right\u2014it was. But it was the only way Park knew how to protect his crop from daily variations in temperature and humidity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by SeungHwan Jeong\n\nThis process was also unreliable. By counting on experience, advice from others, and the weather forecasts, Park sometimes got it wrong, and he would return the next morning to find a greenhouse full of wilted plants.Today, Park is no longer making educated guesses and unnecessary trips to open the windows. In fact, he doesn\u2019t need to do it himself at all. Instead, he receives a recommendation from an app on his smartphone, and then, he uses the app to optimize the ventilation automatically\u2014all thanks to a smart greenhouse system built on Amazon Web Services (AWS) that\u2019s revolutionizing the way he runs his family business.The tasty crop in question is perilla leaf, a much-loved staple of South Korean cuisine. Anyone who\u2019s tried traditional dishes, such as Korean barbecue, has almost certainly encountered it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by SeungHwan Jeong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe system that tirelessly adjusts the ventilation in Park\u2019s greenhouses is a technological solution called \u201cG-Smart\u201d\u2014developed as part of a pilot program by Digilog, an agricultural technology startup, and the local authorities in Geumsan County, with support from AWS.When you enter one of Park's greenhouses, you\u2019ll find cameras moving on an overhead rail, gathering images of perilla leaves, and sensors collecting real-time data on soil conditions, air temperature, humidity, solar radiation, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and other crop-related statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe G-Smart system processes this information using AWS machine learning tools, to gain insights on leaf health and growth, as well as to make predictions on environmental changes and generate recommendations for farmers.\u201cMany small-scale farmers have limited resources and access to investment,\u201d said HyunKwon Suh, CEO of Digilog\u2014named because its founders want to apply digital technology to the \u201canalog domain\u201d of agriculture for the benefit of farmers in South Korea and beyond.\u201cThe farmers tend to live and work in somewhat isolated environments, and understandably, they can be skeptical about change when they\u2019ve been doing something the same way for 30 or 40 years. We\u2019ve started with a small number of farmers who are open to trying something new. Once we\u2019re able to demonstrate their success, we hope that will encourage more farmers to get involved.\u201dThe program aims to reach almost 2,000 farms in the future, save farmers valuable hours every day, and increase productivity by 5%. Through these efforts, Geumsan County is encouraging widespread adoption of smart farm and intelligent control systems. If it succeeds, the region will become the world\u2019s largest producer of perilla leaf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by SeungHwan Jeong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by SeungHwan Jeong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs one of the participating farmers, Park has not had to invest in any equipment. The project has funding from the local authorities, including Geumsan County, with the idea being that the pilot will allow the Digilog team to home in on the most significant growth factors for perilla leaf. This means that when brought to scale, G-Smart will only require farmers to spend a minimal amount on installing devices, while maximizing perilla leaf production and increasing income. Ultimately, farmers will benefit\u2014along with everyone\u2019s cooking.Digilog hopes to adapt the G-Smart solution so it can be used for other types of crops\u2014for farmers in South Korea, then across Asia, and potentially, even further.\u201cWe want to bring value to the thousands of small-scale farmers who are currently excluded from the digital advancement taking place in our cities,\u201d said Suh. \u201cWith the development of G-Smart, we\u2019re showing how machine learning can have real, tangible impacts on people\u2019s livelihoods. In the long term, we\u2019d like to take this concept to as many farmers, in as many different countries, as possible.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS empowers startups solving critical challenges in the cloud \n\nAmazon Web Services is launching two AWS Global Accelerator programs to help startups address some of the world\u2019s most pressing challenges while building successful, cloud-based businesses.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Park, taking part in the pilot has transformed how he thinks about farming.\u201cAt first, it was difficult to adapt, as everything was new to me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the process was easy, and the results, so far, have been really impressive. I now think this kind of technology is necessary for agriculture, if we\u2019re going to keep up with the rapidly changing times.\u201dDigilog developed the G-Smart solution and is now working to improve it, following a \u2018Smart Farm Challenge\u2019 workshop at the Cloud Innovation Center (CIC) in Busan. The center is part of AWS\u2019s global CIC Program, an initiative that brings together nonprofit, education, and government organizations to collaborate on solutions to address real-world problems using cloud technologies.\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nAWSCommunityClimate \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            South Korean farmers grow more perilla leaf with machine learning \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","58":"\n\n\nThe annual program offers local artists monetary grants and the opportunity to exhibit a unique piece of work across Amazon\u2019s Seattle office and new Bellevue office.\n\nAmazon\u2019s 2022 Artist in Residence program will feature seven new artists from the Greater Puget Sound area, demonstrating a range of mediums and styles.

This is part of Amazon\u2019s $300 million transit commitment from 2021 to create 3,000 new affordable homes in collaboration with the transit agencies in each region.\u201cThe Amazon Housing Equity Fund is tackling the affordable housing crisis on multiple fronts and through innovative solutions, such as teaming up with public transit authorities, which brings people closer to more opportunities, services, and a better quality of life,\u201d said Catherine Buell, director of the Amazon Housing Equity Fund, a more than $2 billion commitment to create and preserve 20,000 affordable homes for individuals and families earning moderate to low incomes in Washington state\u2019s Puget Sound region; the Arlington, Virginia region; and Nashville, Tennessee. \u201cWe know that our investment in these areas brings many economic opportunities for residents in the region, but we also acknowledge that this growth needs to benefit everyone in the community. The progress we have made in our first year is promising, but we have more to do.\u201dSince the launch of the Amazon Housing Equity Fund in January 2021, Amazon has invested more than $1.2 billion to create or preserve over 8,000 affordable homes for families earning between 30%-80% of area median income, including first responders, teachers, and service industry employees whose wages haven\u2019t kept pace with escalating rents. For each Amazon-funded affordable home, rents will be maintained at levels affordable for low- and moderate-income families (generally for 98 to 99 years), and rents will only rise with wage growth as determined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. \n\n\n\n\n                \u201cThe future is bright for smart growth near Metro and other transit options in Prince George\u2019s County and throughout the entire region we serve.\u201d\n            \n\nPaul J.

As Washington's largest private employer, with more than 85,000 employees, and the operator of an expansive logistics network, we at Amazon are especially interested in the transportation system and have a long history of advocating for its maintenance and expansion. We know that transportation investments help everyone, as Washington residents rely on transportation infrastructure to commute to work, deliver goods, and participate in economic activity.We thank Senator Marko Liias and Representative Jake Fey for their leadership on the recently passed bicameral infrastructure proposal, \u201cMove Ahead Washington,\u201d and we thank the legislators who passed this bill for the benefit of our state\u2019s residents and continued economic growth.This package will fix old bridges, patch our roads, and help ensure clean air and water through projects that address smog, fish barriers, and stormwater runoff. It will improve system reliability, reduce carbon emissions and traffic, and offer more innovative travel choices. It will provide near-term construction jobs as we recover from the COVID-induced recession, along with long-term economic benefits that come from improved infrastructure. It also makes significant progress on our state\u2019s maintenance, operation, and preservation backlog while continuing to build a clean and equitable transportation future. It\u2019s the right package for right now.It includes key projects like the I-405 corridor, bus rapid transit on I-405, the Eastrail bike and walking path in Bellevue, and the Mountains to Sound Greenway to support the rapid job growth on the Eastside while reducing carbon emissions.

Among the nearly 100 new signatories joining are the world\u2019s largest container shipping company, Maersk; the leading enterprise software developer SAP; the North American timberland company Weyerhaeuser; the largest residential solar company in the U.S., Sunrun; and the leading brand in connected car and audio services, HARMAN.Signatories to The Climate Pledge must agree to:Measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis.Implement decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement through real business changes and innovations, including efficiency improvements, renewable energy, materials reductions, and other carbon emission elimination strategies.Neutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial offsets to achieve net-zero annual carbon emissions by 2040.\u201cThe effects of climate change are becoming more and more apparent in our surroundings and daily lives, and we firmly believe that the private sector must continue to innovate and collaborate across regions and industries in order to decarbonize the global economy at scale,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO. \u201cIt\u2019s an encouraging sign that more than 300 businesses have now signed The Climate Pledge, which commits them to confronting climate change head-on by incorporating real business changes that will make a lasting impact on our planet. We can only do it together.\u201dMany of the new Pledge signatories are already making great strides toward reducing their carbon emissions:MaerskMaersk is providing industry-leading green customer offerings across the supply chain, including Maersk ECO Delivery, which targets emission reductions in ocean shipping. Amazon began participating in this service in 2020 and continues today. Amazon\u2019s participation reduced emissions by approximately 20 KTonnes of CO2e (the equivalent of 50 million average passenger vehicle miles) in 2021.\u201cSolving the climate emergency and decarbonizing our customers\u2019 supply chains is a strategic imperative for Maersk,\u201d said Soren Skou, CEO of A.P. Moller\u2013Maersk. \u201cHence, back in January 2021 we accelerated our decarbonization commitment to net-zero emissions by 2040\u2014a decade ahead of our initial 2050 ambitions and the Paris Agreement. To drive the massive scale-up of green fuels, we all must move now and take action. If we are meant to see changes this decade, we cannot afford to wait, and in that context, we look forward to joining The Climate Pledge, an opportunity to team up with some of our major customers, learn from them, and share best practices and solutions.\u201dSAPSAP recently accelerated its target for achieving net-zero carbon emissions to 2030\u201420 years earlier than originally targeted.\u201cClimate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time, and the time to act is now,\u201d said Christian Klein, SAP CEO. \u201cTechnology provides us with an opportunity to create a lasting, positive impact for future generations, and SAP is proud to join The Climate Pledge to help drive this change.\u201dWeyerhaeuserWeyerhaeuser is sustainably managing forests and manufacturing wood products across North America to provide a sustainable supply of wood for homes and countless other products while protecting wildlife habitat and serving as a natural climate solution through carbon sequestration and storage. Weyerhaeuser reforests 100% of its timberlands after harvesting\u2014planting between 130 and 150 million trees each year.\u201cSustainability has been a guiding principle at Weyerhaeuser for well over a century, and we have long believed that our company has an obligation to make a positive impact in our communities and for society more broadly,\u201d said Devin W. Stockfish, Weyerhaeuser president and CEO. \u201cOur working forests and the sustainable wood products we produce play a critical role in helping to mitigate the impacts of climate change. And as part of our ongoing sustainability efforts, we have published our inaugural, peer-leading Carbon Record and established a leadership position among our North American industry peers by setting an ambitious, science-based greenhouse gas reduction target. Signing on to The Climate Pledge reflects our commitment to achieve these goals and to help lead on the path to net-zero emissions globally.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                \u201cThe business community must have a clear path forward: Step up and accelerate emissions reductions so that we might avoid the worst of the damages yet to come.\u201d\n            \n\nChristiana Figueres\nFounding Partner of Global Optimism and the United Nations' former Climate Chief\n\n\n\n\nSunrunSunrun\u2019s systems have prevented 8.1 million metric tons of carbon emissions, which is equivalent to negating 20 billion miles driven by an average passenger vehicle.\u201cAt Sunrun, people and the planet are our north star,\u201d said Mary Powell, Sunrun CEO. \u201cSince our founding, we've helped more than 660,000 customers across the U.S. switch to clean energy and reduce their carbon emissions through our home solar and battery storage systems, and we're just getting started. We're laser focused on finding more ways to electrify homes and enable all Americans to take action on climate change, reduce energy costs, and gain energy independence. We are proud to demonstrate this commitment by signing the Climate Pledge alongside other sustainability leaders.\u201dHARMANWith a long-standing focus on purpose, sustainability is one of HARMAN\u2019s key strategic business pillars. As part of HARMAN\u2019s commitment to achieving net-zero carbon across Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 2040, it\u2019s working toward ambitious, measurable shorter-term targets that aim to reduce emissions, energy usage, and waste across its value chain. HARMAN has introduced new product lines made from responsibly sourced and recycled materials and has committed to 100% renewable energy in all HARMAN factories by 2025.\u201cAt HARMAN, we know that driving sustainability is an ongoing journey that benefits from constant collaboration,\u201d said Tom Mooney, HARMAN senior director of Government Affairs and Sustainability. \u201cEach of the other Climate Pledge signatories is as committed as we are to building a more sustainable future and understands the value of working together toward our common goal. We\u2019re excited to be joining forces with this community of innovators and thought leaders to create meaningful change.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Climate Pledge\n\nAmazon is committed to building a sustainable business for our customers and the planet. In 2019, Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge\u2014a commitment to be net zero carbon across our business by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Climate Pledge also welcomes several companies that have previously received investments through the $2 billion Climate Pledge Fund, Amazon\u2019s corporate venture capital fund that invests in companies that can help accelerate a path to meeting The Climate Pledge. These companies include BETA Technologies, an electric aerospace company, and Infinium, a renewable fuels technology company, which both aim to support decarbonization efforts in the global transportation sector. The sector was responsible for approximately 7.3 billion metric tons of carbon emissions in 2020. Nearly 13% of signatories represent transportation, aviation, and logistics sectors, sending an important signal that there will be rapid growth in demand for products and services that help reduce carbon emissions in this key sector.Additionally, Climate Pledge Fund investee and new signatory Pachama is bringing quality, transparency, and scale to nature-based carbon markets. Pachama uses remote sensing and machine learning to measure carbon stored in forests and monitor them over time, allowing organizations and individuals to compensate for their emissions with confidence by supporting reforestation and forest conservation projects.The latest report from the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emphasizes the need for immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to invest in natural climate solutions to limit warming to close to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and to mitigate damages.\"In the face of great peril, which is what the latest science depicts, the business community must have a clear path forward: Step up and accelerate emissions reductions so that we might avoid the worst of the damages yet to come,\u201d said Christiana Figueres, founding partner of Global Optimism and the United Nations' former climate chief. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging, therefore, that 300 companies are committed to working together to achieve net-zero by 2040 or sooner through The Climate Pledge. But 300 companies are not enough to deliver the transformations we need. I encourage all business leaders to get to grips with the science, translate it for their businesses, and enable the changes we need without delay.\u201dIn 2019, Amazon and Global Optimism co-founded The Climate Pledge, a commitment to reach the Paris Agreement 10 years early and be net-zero carbon by 2040. Now, 312 organizations have signed The Climate Pledge, sending an important signal that there will be rapid growth in demand for products and services that help reduce carbon emissions.Learn more about all 312 signatories that have committed to The Climate Pledge and the actions they are taking to decarbonize their businesses.\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nThe Climate PledgeSustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            The Climate Pledge announces nearly 100 new signatories\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","63":"\n\n\n The Alexa Fund helps these women founders innovate to make education comprehensive and entertaining.\n\nThe Alexa Fund\u2019s mission is to invest in companies that drive innovations in voice, artificial intelligence, and ambient computing that positively impact customers\u2019 lives. We believe that a great place to start is an education in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and a passion for reading. To that end, we want to help parents ignite a passion for well-rounded learning in their kids and students. The Alexa Fund, with its wide portfolio of startups in fields from robotics to gaming to health to\u2014you guessed it\u2014education, invests in and supports founders and innovators who are bridging the gaps between every part of a comprehensive education, and between learning and fun. Unruly Studios co-founder Bryanne Leeming and Zoobean co-founder Jordan Lloyd Bookey bring different backgrounds and approaches to education. Lloyd Bookey and her company help libraries and schools use technology and data to inspire their students and young patrons to read. Leeming uses a play-based curriculum to bring a foundational STEM education\u2014covering a range of subjects\u2014to kids in classrooms of all shapes and sizes. Despite their distinctive methods, both are using computing and technology to make a well-rounded education accessible to children everywhere. Unruly Studios, Bryanne Leeming Leeming learned to code by playing games. Now she\u2019s helping students across the U.S. and Canada to do the same through Unruly Studios. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBryanne Leeming, Unruly Studios co-founder\n\nUnruly Splats, Leeming\u2019s brainchild, is a cross-curricular program that brings STEM to classrooms through play. Teachers and students use tablets to drag and drop code that sets rules for Unruly Splats\u2014 the durable floor buttons for which the program is named\u2014to light up or make different sounds. Students, mostly in elementary schools, then stomp on them in a variety of games like whack-a-mole, relay races, or dance experiences.\u201cUltimately, they\u2019re building games together with friends,\u201d Leeming said. And Unruly Splats does seem like it\u2019s all fun and games. In large part, at least for students, that\u2019s because it is. But Unruly Splats is also a product of Leeming\u2019s reflections that the way most students are introduced to coding is \u201coften a very similar experience that attracts the same kinds of kids.\u201d That reflection is widely validated by the largely homogenous makeup of the tech industry. Leeming, a lifelong athlete with a degree in cognitive science, thought she could tap into kids\u2019 penchant for play as a way to make STEM more appealing to a wider range of students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKids playing Unruly Splats with their teacher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cConnecting it to things that are creative, connecting it to sports, these things invite a whole new range of kids into computer science,\u201d Leeming said. Because the STEM aspect of the Unruly Splats program is nearly invisible, teachers in a range of subjects from physical education to language arts to math have employed the program to tremendous success. That\u2019s intentional. \u201cWe built this adaptable program and teachers take it even further into their subject areas,\u201d Leeming said. \u201c[I\u2019m] always so inspired by what our teacher community comes up with.\u201d The Unruly Studios team, which runs the Unruly Splats program, has been particularly surprised by the use cases in music. Leeming references a music teacher in Florida who wasn\u2019t able to use instruments in her classroom because of the pandemic, so she began using Unruly Splats instead. The music teacher assigned a specific music note to each Splat, Leeming said. Each student had their own Splat, and despite being spread out, they were able to play a song together.While coding and STEM are fundamental to the Unruly Splats curriculum, Leeming doesn\u2019t see creating future programmers as the goal of the program. Her own exposure to coding in elementary school empowered her to use technology with a purpose. It\u2019s her aim that Unruly Splats does the same for students everywhere. \u201cWe think computer science should just be a part of the day. Tech is everywhere, and we really want kids to be able to relate to it in all these different contexts,\u201d Leeming said. \u201cWe feel like if you get this exposure, you\u2019ll feel like you can see yourself there. You\u2019ll feel invited, you\u2019ll feel like technology is approachable. Then it\u2019s going to help you no matter what.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEM education as a diversity driver in tech\n\nAmazon recently commissioned a study to explore the timely need for more computer science and STEM education for students from underserved and underrepresented communities to best prepare them for jobs of the future. \n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough their headquarters are in Boston, Leeming and Unruly Studios moved out to Seattle in the summer of 2018 to participate in the three-month Alexa Accelerator, which is now Alexa Next Stage. The program, which connects founders to mentors, and opens up a host of resources within Amazon and beyond, is just one of the many ways Leeming says working with the Alexa Fund has helped her and Unruly Studios. Most notably, the Alexa Fund aided Leeming in building a community among\u2014and relationships with\u2014other founders, including the founders of a book-of-the-month club that has undergone an incredible transition, and now is helping libraries and schools turn students and adults alike into lifelong readers.That book-of-the-month club is Zoobean.Zoobean and Beanstack, Jordan Lloyd BookeyThe Zoobean story starts in a place with which many parents are familiar. Soon-to-be co-founders Jordan Lloyd Bookey and her husband Felix were trying to prepare their 2-year-old son to be a big brother. They searched and searched for books that would help him understand what having a baby sister might be like, but, being an interracial and interfaith couple, they struggled to find a book to which their son could relate. Then a librarian friend recommended the book All the World, and as they read it their son lit up, recognizing himself and the little sister he would soon have. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Lloyd Bookey, Zoobean co-founder\n\nThat joyous moment of recognition ultimately inspired the couple to found Zoobean, the company that now helps schools and libraries bring the wonders of reading to students around the world. Originally launched as a curated book-of-the-month club, Zoobean\u2019s path has taken them from Lloyd Bookey\u2019s home to the stage of the TV show Shark Tank, and the company has continued to evolve\u2014and embrace technology\u2014every step of the way.\u201cWe wanted to recreate that magical feeling for other people,\u201d Lloyd Bookey said. \u201cWhile that\u2019s where we started, it\u2019s nowhere near where we are now.\u201d Zoobean\u2019s next iteration was as a reader advisory for public library systems, and eventually, they launched Beanstack, the gamified platform with an interface that makes logging reading time easy and fun, helping schools and libraries create reading challenges that build lifelong readers. Then came the pandemic.\u201cPeople who didn\u2019t have an online solution needed an online solution, and it meant that we had extreme growth in a really short period of time,\u201d Lloyd Bookey said. As the chief client-success officer, she ensured that Zoobean\u2019s clients were getting the most of the program, and Zoobean\u2019s rapid growth necessitated some changes for her team. \u201cIt meant we had to revisit our processes,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a client-success team and as a company we grew up a lot during that time, because before, we could work personally with a lot of clients. We still do work as personally as possible, but we had to scale.\u201d And scale they have. Lloyd Bookey and her team have implemented resources, how-to guides, and community platforms to help schools and libraries from Sacramento to Auckland integrate with Beanstack. They even have a webinar program for clients to share best practices among an expanding community of readers. As her company has grown, the Alexa Fund has been there right alongside Lloyd Bookey and the team that she calls her family, as well as her literal family. She said the Alexa Fund has helped with everything from connecting Zoobean to internal resources, to helping with decision-making.\u201cWe view Alexa [Fund] as a trusted advisor,\u201d Lloyd Bookey said. \u201cChildren are more likely to eat apples if they are sliced for them. So, we always say, \u2018Slice the apple.\u2019 Like Alexa, our goal is to make it easier for people to do things.\u201d Zoobean has sliced the apple for readers in a lot of different ways over the years, and it continues to innovate with timely, curated reading challenges, an engaging app, and a new initiative to launch its own reading content. The goal remains the same: to bring the joy of reading to people everywhere. \u201cHaving this love and desire to read from a young age means that you\u2019re going to be a lifelong reader,\u201d Lloyd Bookey said. \u201cIt means that you\u2019re going to have more opportunities, better test scores, and other sorts of things later in life as well. That\u2019s definitely what keeps us motivated.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nAlexa FundInnovationEducation DevicesAlexa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            Can education be fun?

The programs we've launched build on successful 2021 AWS accelerators for space and clean energy startups. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTough customers: When startups and Amazon Web Services met\n\nThe First Movers Coalition targets emission reductions in aviation, ocean shipping, steel, and trucking, reflecting Amazon\u2019s continuing investment in decarbonizing technologies.\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile each four-week program is designed for a specific cohort and challenge, participants across the board gain access to powerful support, guidance, and perks such as:Up to $100,000 in\u00a0AWS Activate\u00a0credits to use toward cloud infrastructure and advanced servicesCollaboration opportunities with AWS customers and members of the AWS Partner NetworkMarketing and go-to-market supportSpecialized AWS training and mentoring from domain and technical subject matter expertsGuidance on business development and fundraising from AWS and accelerator program collaboratorsOpportunity to network with other startup founders who are navigating similar challengesApplications for the AWS Space Accelerator and AWS Sustainable Cities Accelerator programs are open now through April 15. AWS Space Accelerator Exactly 75 years ago this month, a camera aboard a V-22 rocket returned the first photograph captured just above the Karman Line, the official boundary between Earth\u2019s atmosphere and outer space. Advances in engineering are helping to transport human technology far beyond Earth\u2019s atmosphere. As the rapid pace of innovation continues across the global aerospace industry, much of that innovation will continue to come from startups. This is why we\u2019re launching the next AWS Space Accelerator, in collaboration with AlchemistX. The program is open to space startups around the world with innovative ideas for using the cloud to reimagine solutions for both government and commercial space missions. The 2022 AWS Space Accelerator builds on the success of the 2021 cohort of startups, which represented an amazing breadth of solutions related to Earth observation, robotics, spacecraft launch and delivery, spacecraft hardware and software, satellite operations, human space travel, and launch operations.\u201cThe accelerator opened the eyes of our team to all of the opportunities and challenges in the emerging space market,\u201d said Adam Kaplan, CEO of Edgybees. Learn more about this announcement and the AWS Space Accelerator. AWS Sustainable Cities Accelerator Cities occupy just 3% of the Earth's land but account for 75% of carbon emissions. With the urban population expected to grow from 4 billion to 6 billion people by 2045, developing sustainable cities is a critical part of the fight against climate change. The AWS Sustainable Cities Accelerator\u2014launching in collaboration with Freshwater Advisors and Public Spend Forum\u2014focuses on a specific and critical part of the equation: mobility and transportation. AWS is looking for mature clean-tech startups from around the world that are working on micro-mobility, last-mile delivery, urban parking and route optimization, electric vehicle charging infrastructure and applications, Internet of Things (IoT) transportation and traffic optimization, or other solutions to promote sustainable transportation and mobility in urban settings. The goal is to help these startups learn how to innovate and accelerate their growth through advanced cloud-based technologies. This is the second sustainability-focused accelerator program, with last year\u2019s AWS Clean Energy Accelerator resulting in multiple commercial pilot deployments for participating startups. \u201cThe AWS Clean Energy Accelerator was a comprehensive program that educated me on all aspects of our business\u2014go-to-market strategy, policy and regulation, funding resources, and much more,\u201d said James Larson, CEO of E-Zinc. \u201cI also developed some fantastic relationships during the program and am truly grateful for the connections I made.\u201d Learn more about this announcement and the AWS Sustainable Cities Accelerator.\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nSpaceClimate InnovationAWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            AWS empowers startups solving critical challenges in the cloud \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","65":"\n\n\nTogether, Amazon and the BOTTLE consortium will focus on reducing plastic pollution through innovation in materials and recycling.\n\nImagine a new technology that breaks down existing plastic materials to create a new, innovative type of material. This new material could then be broken down more easily when recycled\u2014and even biodegrade in natural environments.That scenario does not have to be imaginary. In fact, the mission of the BOTTLE consortium\u2014a key research initiative under the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), launched in 2020\u2014is to bring these new technologies and materials to life. BOTTLE stands for \u201cBio-Optimized Technologies to keep Thermoplastics out of Landfills and the Environment.\" The consortium, led by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), was created to spur innovation and advance new technologies to address plastic pollution by bringing together cutting edge talent and capabilities from both the public and private sectors.Amazon has joined the DOE-backed project to help further its progress in developing chemical upcycling. The research collaboration is a way of handling today\u2019s plastics and ensuring tomorrow\u2019s plastics are recyclable by design.\u201cPlastics are extremely versatile materials, and often they are still the best option available for a myriad of functions,\u201d said Gregg Beckham, BOTTLE\u2019s CEO and a senior research fellow at the NREL. \u201cFinding a way to better recycle single-use plastics while reducing and ultimately eliminating their use is a grand challenge of our time, and we\u2019re committed to pursuing scientific advancement to this end. With Amazon\u2019s innovation expertise, we\u2019re excited to work together to find solutions that have the potential to have vast, positive impacts.\u201dAs part of the consortium, Amazon\u2019s growing team of materials scientists and experts hopes to develop technologies and materials that will enable the full life cycle of plastics to be net-zero carbon. Amazon\u2019s team will work with the consortium to create new energy-efficient technology that will break down different kinds of plastics and turn them into valuable materials that can be used to make the same types of plastics or new plastics. In cases where the materials don\u2019t make it back into the recycling stream, the molecular structure of the new materials will be designed to biodegrade in natural environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing Amazon Aware, a new line of everyday essentials\n\nAmazon Aware includes apparel, home, beauty, and more\u2014all thoughtfully designed and made from materials such as recycled polyester, organic cotton, and bio-based ingredients.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis research is another step in Amazon\u2019s efforts to eliminate or reduce packaging waste. As of 2021, Amazon had reduced the outbound weight of packaging per shipment by 36%, a total of one million tons, while increasing the use of recyclable materials.The BOTTLE consortium is currently supported by the Bioenergy Technologies Office and the Advanced Manufacturing Office, both within DOE\u2019s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. Its partners include four additional DOE research laboratories and five universities.\u201cIn partnership with BOTTLE, we plan to make significant progress in developing new technologies and materials that will lead to less material in landfills and more back into the circular economy,\u201d said Alan Jacobsen, principal materials scientist at Amazon. \u201cScience and innovation are at the heart of our sustainability work at Amazon, and we\u2019re committed to using our size and scale to reduce and eliminate our use of materials and find new ones that can be applied to our operations and other industries around the world.\u201dLearn more about the science behind Amazon\u2019s work with the BOTTLE consortium and Amazon\u2019s sustainable packaging efforts.\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nSustainabilityThe Climate PledgeRecycling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            Amazon and U.S. Department of Energy team up to cut plastic waste\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","66":"\n\n\n\nUpdated on March 8 to include the fact that AWS is no longer accepting new sign-ups based in Russia or Belarus.Alongside supplying humanitarian relief and support to Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), to help those affected by the violence, AWS has been working closely with Ukrainian customers and partners to keep their applications secure. Teams of Account Managers, Security Specialists, Solutions Architects, and other technical professionals are working around the clock to help customers and partners at this critical time. We are helping these customers employ security best practices, through following our Well-Architected Framework, to ensure that workloads are protected. In other cases, we are building and supplying technical services and tools to customers in Ukraine to help them securely migrate their on-premises infrastructure onto AWS in order to protect it from any potential physical or virtual attack. For several weeks, we have been partnering closely with Ukrainian IT organizations to fend off attacks and working with organizations in Ukraine, and around the world, to share real-time, relevant intelligence. As a result, our teams have seen new malware signatures and activity from a number of state actors we monitor. As this activity has ramped up, our teams and technologies detected the threats, learned the patterns, and placed remediation tools directly into the hands of customers. As always, our teams are constantly learning from the intelligence we collect to continue evolving protections for our infrastructure. We employ a \u2018follow the sun\u2019 model where our teams track new threat intelligence 24\/7 and are able to quickly respond to issues. Our security teams are sharing this intelligence with governments and IT organizations that we partner closely with from Europe, North America, and around the world to equip critical infrastructure owners and operators with additional information to protect their facilities.While we are seeing an increase in activity of malicious state actors, we are also seeing a higher operational tempo by other malicious actors. We have seen several situations where malware has been specifically targeted at charities, NGOs, and other aid organizations in order to spread confusion and cause disruption. In these particularly egregious cases, malware has been targeted at disrupting medical supplies, food, and clothing relief. We\u2019ll continue to work hard to protect these customers and will continue to work closely with them as they carry out their much-needed work to help those impacted by this terrible conflict.Our public sector teams partner closely with governments to understand their security needs, responding quickly with support and guidance. In the lead up to this conflict, we consulted with the Ukrainian government, nations across the European Union, the European Commission, the U.S. government, NATO, and other organizations. AWS remains committed to providing security expertise and support, as mentioned in Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy\u2019s message on Twitter to the people of Ukraine.Unlike other U.S. technology providers, AWS has no data centers, infrastructure, or offices in Russia, and we have a long-standing policy of not doing business with the Russian government. We have also stopped allowing new sign-ups for AWS in Russia and Belarus. Our biggest customers using AWS in Russia are companies who are headquartered outside of the country and have some development teams there. AWS has clear terms of service where if a customer is using AWS services to threaten, incite, promote, or actively encourage violence, terrorism, or other serious harm, they will not be permitted to use our services. Any customer we know of who is participating in this type of behavior will have their access to AWS suspended.As this conflict continues, AWS and Amazon are actively assisting and will carry on doing so into the future for both the people of Ukraine and around the world. We will continue working to support the relief efforts and to bring our security expertise and services to help to everyone that needs them.We will also continue to share updates and progress on our efforts.Learn more about Amazon's assistance in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nAWSCommunityUkraine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            Amazon\u2019s cybersecurity assistance for Ukraine\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","67":"\n\n\n\nGiven the ongoing situation in Russia and Ukraine, we\u2019ve taken additional actions in the region.

As a sales enablement director with Amazon Web Services (AWS) in New Jersey, she strives to be a role model for other women in a work culture that she says values diversity, intelligence, and innovation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeg Columbia-Walsh, sales enablement director at AWS\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged to think big, innovate, and earn trust. We cannot do that well with a single strand of experience and thinking, or single demographic,\u201d Columbia-Walsh said. \u201cWe can only do that well with a diverse number of qualifications, experiences, and cultures. [Diversity] is limitless in its intellectual contribution.\u201dThe women of AWS are increasingly experiencing what\u2019s limitless thanks to an inclusive work environment that runs much deeper than hiring quotas or diversity initiatives. Employee-led affinity groups provide virtual and in-person spaces for connection and belonging while women leaders and mentors prove that working to build the future together starts with everyone getting a seat at the table.\u201cThere are countless studies that have shown that the more diverse a workplace is, the more productive and profitable [it becomes],\u201d Columbia-Walsh said. \u201cWe cannot claim to be the best if we do not have the inclusion of that diverse thinking and experience. The breadth of the contribution that comes from a diverse workforce\u2014it is a precious commodity.\u201dEmpowering our peopleWhen Natalia Valle, a senior business development manager in Seattle for AWS Marketplace, moved into her role about two years ago, she didn\u2019t notice many women. As the daughter of two immigrants\u2014her mother is from Cuba, and her father is from Italy\u2014she also noticed there wasn\u2019t much Latino representation at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatalia Valle, senior business development manager for AWS Marketplace\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if there were any Latin women two years ago, but that\u2019s changed drastically just in the last year and a half,\u201d Valle said.Valle said that as AWS grows, the opportunities to grow diversity across the company are as exciting as they are vast. As she can attest, having moved from non-technical roles at Amazon\u2014a global vendor manager for consumer electronics in retail followed by a senior business development manager for Launchpad in retail\u2014to a technical role at AWS, the work culture and career growth opportunities across the company are perfectly poised to foster that growth.\u201cWe have really strong leaders who mentor and teach. Skills can be learned, and it\u2019s important to acknowledge that career paths vary and don\u2019t have to be decided in college or even in your first couple of jobs,\u201d Valle said. \u201cI want to see more women in tech, more Latin women in tech, and more Latinos in general in tech. AWS is working to make that happen, but it also requires the people in the organization to do their part.\u201d\n\n\n\nWomen in Tech: International Women's Day\n\nJoin the Women in Tech conversation to hear more from AWS women around the globe.\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s why Valle does exactly that. She\u2019s a member of the Inclusion Board at AWS, the Latinos and Women affinity groups, the Seattle chapter of the national organization Girls in Tech, and she volunteers for an internal Amazon program called Candid Chats. She\u2019s involved because she knows how impactful it can be to see people who look like you working in roles you might never have imagined were possible.\u201cWe set up a 30-minute coffee chat for candidates so they have the opportunity to talk to somebody in the company who represents their community or background, so they can understand what the work environment could be like for them,\u201d Valle said. \u201cAmazon provides a ton of opportunities for you to advocate for the experiences you\u2019ve had. I wouldn't have been here for as long as I have if I truly didn't believe in the overall mission that we're trying to achieve and the way that we've gone about it.\u201dThat authenticity is exactly what inspires Rebekah Kulidzan, a solutions architect on the UK and Ireland Public Sector team, to share about her experiences at AWS.

We have technology and programs that enable you to get those skills, but we also need people with communications and customer skills.\u201dCase in point: Alex Anderson, a Seattle-based executive assistant at AWS who has learned that her background in sales, marketing, operations, and executive support could be a launchpad for a new career in tech. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, she recognized the significance and staying power of technology. Now, she\u2019s taking computer science classes and plans to enter the Amazon Technical Academy, a nine-month upskilling program that helps employees become software engineers. She found out about the program during one of the Women at Amazon affinity group meetings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlex Anderson, executive assistant at AWS\n\n\u201cEverything depends on technology now, and I want to be part of the future of helping people take their businesses to the next level,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cOne of the reasons I decided to join AWS is because we\u2019re so flexible with career changes. If you do one job and you don\u2019t like it, you can always transition to another job. I see a lot more women in data science, computer science, and software engineering fields now, and Amazon really encourages [making transitions] through programs like the Technical Academy.\u201dA sense of belonging across the globeAt AWS, where all employees are known as builders whether they\u2019re in tech or non-tech roles, the scale and scope of the business often highlights cultural differences around the world. When JuHyeon Song, who heads three business teams for AWS Korea\u2014Digital Native Business, Game, and Independent Software Vendors\u2014attended an AWS leaders conference in 2017, she was nervous about speaking in her non-native English to express her opinions at the meeting. She recalls another director\u2014a woman\u2014calling her by name to kindly and gently give her an opportunity to be heard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuHyeon Song, head of three business teams for AWS Korea\n\n\u201cShe made me comfortable to speak slowly and asked other Western speakers to be patient and pay attention to me,\u201d Song said. \u201cThat was an amazing experience to me and I said to myself, \u2018I\u2019ll be a leader like that who\u2019s considerate and inclusive to ensure every voice is heard.\u2019\u201dSong went on to found the Women at Amazon Korea affinity group in 2018 and served as chair. She has been an active board member ever since. The group has evolved to become the Diversity at Amazon Korea affinity group to embrace diversity beyond gender. Song also shares her experiences and insight around other topics, including women in tech, corporate social responsibility, and working moms, across other forums.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS Careers: Changing the Conversation\n\nReal innovation comes from bringing more perspectives into the conversation\u2014and making sure every voice is heard. AWS is committed to building a more diverse workforce, and an inclusive culture that lets every individual shine. \n\n\n\n\nWatch now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI have often experienced what it\u2019s like being the only woman in the room\u2014that\u2019s why I feel more responsible for helping to grow more woman in tech and leadership,\u201d Song said. \u201cHence, [I] put the continuous effort to eliminate general stereotypes about women to demonstrate my own unique value.\u201dWhen the culture across a company encourages and supports these conversations, women not only feel a sense of belonging, they feel empowered. Rishita Acharya, a logistics manager for data center operations in Mumbai, India, said that translates to benefits across the board, from the company to the customer. She said that thanks to AWS\u2019s non-hierarchal structure, leaders are always approachable, your contributions and skills are valued, and work-life harmony is encouraged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRishita Acharya, logistics manager for data center operations at AWS\n\n\u201cWhen employees feel more connected at work, they tend to work harder and smarter, producing higher quality work.

Learn how it will enable creators to DJ their own shows for free, with tens of millions of licensed songs.\n\nAmazon just released the limited-access beta version of Amp, a new app that will give you a way to DJ your own live radio shows. Creators can use a catalog of tens of millions of licensed songs from Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group, and a long list of independent music companies, such as Beggars Group, Believe, CD Baby, and PIAS, with more being added every day. Creators can also engage with their community in real time\u2014no subscription, additional hardware, or editing needed.\u201cRadio has always been about music and culture,\u201d said John Ciancutti, vice president of Amp. \u201cBut imagine if you were inventing the medium for the first time today. You\u2019d combine what people love about radio\u2014spontaneous talk, new music discovery, diverse personalities, and broad programming\u2014with all that's made possible by today\u2019s technology. You\u2019d make it so anybody with a phone, a voice, and a love for music could make their own show. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. Amp makes it possible for you to grab the mic and run the airwaves. We are creating a new version of radio that will have an infinite dial of shows.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Amp newsletter for updates\n\nWe\u2019ll be sharing more updates in the coming months as we grow this community together. \n\n\n\n\nSubscribe now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmp is building a home where anyone can create live shows alongside some of the biggest names in the industry. As part of the limited beta, Amp is announcing a slate of upcoming shows from some of the biggest names in music. The undisputed reigning queen of hip-hop, Nicki Minaj, will soon bring the highly anticipated return of her radio show, Queen Radio, to Amp, in addition to upcoming shows from Pusha T, singer-songwriter Tinashe, electronic artist and violinist Lindsey Stirling, Travis Barker, Lil Yachty, and Big Boi; well-known personalities Tefi Pessoa and Nikita Dragun; popular radio hosts Zach Sang, Kat Corbett, Christian James Hand, and Guy Raz; and writers from music and culture publication The FADER.\u201cBy bringing these incredible personalities into the beta, creators can experience Amp in a way that drives the feedback needed to build the app together, ahead of a public launch later this year,\u201d said Ciancutti.Amp is completely free to use\u2014it gives creators access to a library of tens of millions of songs they can use when creating their shows, and the ability to invite live callers to join their programs. Amp is creating built-in discovery and notifications, so listeners can find and follow creators and upcoming shows. Hosts can take callers, with control over who speaks and when. They can pre-plan and schedule their shows, and listen to songs in real time with their audiences. In the future, Amp plans to add even more\u2014everything from Alexa integrations to social sharing to innovative new search and discovery features that will connect listeners with the creators delivering the content they are looking for on the dial.We met with Ciancutti ahead of the official beta launch, to learn more about how Amp will work and what makes it unique. Read on for everything you need to know about the limited-access beta of Amp, launching today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Ciancutti, vice president of Amp\n\nWhat opportunity is Amp building for creators?With Amp, we\u2019re building a new way for you to create a live radio show. Amp infuses what listeners love about radio with what\u2019s made possible by today\u2019s technology. People are looking for an evolution in how they discover and share music; Amp is reinventing how fans can go deeper into the experience of live audio, while giving the millions of people creating and sharing playlists today a new way to turn their love of music into live shows.\n\nIntroducing Amp, live radio from Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is Amp launching with limited access and only available to those with an access code?Amp is still in the works. We decided to launch in beta because we believe that in order to serve communities of creators at all levels, we need to be in dialogue with them. We need them using the app and telling us what features they want. This limited-access beta will allow us to partner with passionate early adopters in a diverse community of creators, so we can improve the experience and better serve everyone when the app officially launches.What challenges does Amp solve for creators?How would you build your own radio show if there were no satellite towers or recording studios required, no licensing deals to negotiate, and the tools you needed were already on your phone? Amp is bringing music culture and digital music together. A person with their own unique music taste doesn\u2019t have to land a job at a radio station to reach an audience. They just need to launch a show from their phone on Amp and reach anyone. Starting today, people will be able to see the creation of this new live audio experience being built in real time, right in front of their eyes.From your perspective, how does Amp reimagine radio?When I was a kid, radio was really different from how it is today. DJs were local to their markets. I used to move back and forth from San Francisco to Miami between parents, and radio sounded completely\u00a0different in each city. Not the music, but the sound, everything. DJs would play local music and emerging artists, they were kingmakers, and they drove local music culture. I felt a connection to those DJs. Of course, they didn't know who I was; I was just one of their listeners. But with Amp, that relationship can go both ways. I\u2019m excited for Amp to bring that opportunity to listeners. This beta launch allows us to create that opportunity. It\u2019s not easy to build a brand-new community of creators from scratch, which is why we are so excited to have so many big names joining us on this development process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do you create a show on Amp?We are designing Amp to be easy for anyone to use\u2014with everything needed to easily set up a show and go live, built into the app. As a creator, you can host your own show, play hits or deep cuts, talk sports, riff on pop culture, and curate your own playlists with like-minded listeners. The experience and user interface are really intuitive\u2014you can go from launching the app to creating a new show in seconds.How is Amp different from social audio apps or music streaming services?Our starting place for Amp is radio, which means the experience centers on the ability to use a fully licensed catalog of music. We think there are infinite opportunities with live audio technology\u2014and what is currently out there has not even scratched the surface. Amp is bringing the cultural experience into live audio, by creating a space for shows that are curated by people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat support is Amp offering new creators?The Amp website is where creators and their listeners can get up-to-date information and live support. This includes everything from how to go live and how to optimize your content for Amp, to being notified of upcoming creator programs and how to take part in them. Our team will also be identifying shows to feature and promote across our marketing channels to help our creators find new audiences.How is Amazon working with artists on Amp?Artists have really responded to what they can do with Amp. They want to run shows, play new music, and share the songs that have influenced them\u2014they\u2019ve also talked about using Amp as a way to get their fans to start creating, too.How will Amazon handle violations and protect user safety?Customer trust and safety has been a priority since day one. When I joined Amazon, there was a small team already working on Amp, and the leader of our Trust and Safety team was one of them. With the beginning of the public beta, we have comprehensive community guidelines that are centered on safety and trust. Listeners and creators can report perceived violations of these guidelines either directly from a show or from the app, and we have a 24\/7 moderation team that reviews the reports and takes actions in real time. Protecting listeners and creators has been top-of-mind since the beginning, and we want to make sure we get it right. Here is the bottom line: The app and our moderation team have established an open line of communication with our users, so we can hear about issues and take action when needed.What are you listening to on the app?One of my favorite shows on Amp is called CRIOYO Radio. It's run by a creator named Daniel who plays all kinds of Latin music. He runs the show out of New York, but his roots are in Latin America and the Caribbean, so he understands the music incredibly well. I love listening because I learn a lot about the music. I also call in to the show frequently. We talk about the music that he's playing, but we also talk about its origins. We've talked about everything from great food to where I should travel. These conversations have deepened my relationship with him as a creator and have strengthened the sense of community I experience as a listener of the show.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQsHow can you get access to the beta version of Amp and when will it be available to more creators? People can get access to the beta version by downloading Amp from the U.S. iOS App Store and signing up for the waitlist, or by subscribing to the Amp Newsletter. People can also follow the @onamp_ social accounts on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, where we\u2019ll be regularly dropping codes to join the app. Do you need an Amazon account to access Amp?Yes, users must use or create a free Amazon account as their login credentials for Amp.\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nAmazon MusicEntertainmentInnovation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            Run the airwaves with Amp, the live radio app from Amazon\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","70":"\n\n\nLearn how two sisters use Alexa to make life easier after a Sjogren\u2019s syndrome diagnosis.\n\nAutoimmune diseases affect more than 24 million Americans, according to National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Receiving a diagnosis of an autoimmune disease can often mean the beginning of a lifelong process of learning to adapt and change: new medication schedules, lifestyle changes, and shifts in the way someone interacts with the people and environments around them.Grace was in her mid-20s when she was diagnosed with Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, an autoimmune disease that can cause chronic pain, fatigue, and other serious complications. Her sister Emma, an Amazon employee, wanted to help Grace however she could, so she turned to Alexa to help find some solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrace enjoying the outdoors with her dog.\n\nIn Emma\u2019s words:Out of the blue one year, my sister, Grace, was diagnosed with Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. Sjogren\u2019s is a condition that manifests in many different ways, but the one that affected Grace the most was the impact it had on her mobility.Today, she has trouble maintaining balance without keeping her eyes on her hands and feet, so getting around her house, especially at night, has become really difficult. It felt like overnight she went from being a young, active park ranger, to needing a little extra support from us all, and I became really interested in exploring how I could best help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmma and Grace celebrating the holidays together.\n\nOur journey with Alexa started because I was looking for a way to help Grace turn on the light beside her bed in the middle of the night. She told me that she was waking her husband every time she wanted to get up, and she found it frustrating to need that help. I thought it\u2019d be cool if she could find a way to do it herself without needing to rely on her vision. I did some research, and it led me to Alexa. That year, I gave her an Echo Dot and some smart plugs and smart light bulbs to go along with it.Now, our entire family has Echo devices in our homes. We all frequently use the Drop In feature, not only to check in on Grace, but also to stay in touch with one another. If Grace needs assistance while she\u2019s home alone, she can call out to one of us and know that we can come and help.I personally love the Echo devices, because not only are they really helpful in assisting my sister in keeping her home more accessible and safe, but they also have a lot of fun elements, like being able to listen to music and get the news just by asking Alexa. Alexa has given my sister the support she needs as she adjusts and learns to trust her own capabilities again.Learn more about how you can use Alexa to connect with and look out for your loved ones, or explore how to set up smart devices to move more freely around your home, hands-free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Alexa helps couples care for one another\n\n\"An Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis is the beginning of a long and complicated journey, and I think Alexa has been a priceless tool in my toolkit in managing it.\"\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a story of your own about how you use Alexa, we'd love to hear it, and we will continue sharing some of our favorite #AlexaStories.

AWS customers have stepped in to offer solutions, EASE Applications sends HIPAA-compliant text updates to families from the emergency room, operating room, intensive care unit, and medical floor. During the COVID-19 crisis, the company is using Amazon Chime SDK to incorporate two-way video communication into its mobile apps so that families of COVID-19 patients have reliable, remote communication with the patients and their doctors. CareMonitor, a provider of remote health monitoring, expanded its platform to monitor the daily health status of COVID-19 patients with low-level symptoms so they can recover from the virus in their own homes. In the CareMonitor app, patients are asked daily symptom questions and collect biometric data like temperature, heart rate and oxygen saturation to gauge their current health status. The app is integrated with Amazon Chime, a set of real-time communications components, to send messages and connect via video to health care providers. Current Health is enabling more than 40 hospitals and care facilities in the UK and U.S. to free up beds, applying its remote monitoring technology to track patients' vital signs outside of the hospital or clinic. Using a medical device that patients wear on their arms, clinicians can continuously monitor patients who are at risk of deteriorating, enabling them to perform triage and consult with patients over video.

Its lightweight, connected devices allow thousands of people with no prior knowledge of galaxies\u2014or understanding of the equipment normally needed to observe them\u2014to experience breathtaking views of the night skies, and to support scientific research by sharing their data via the AWS cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by OLIVIER PIRMAN\n\nUsing the Unistellar app as a remote control, even when offline, users can direct their telescope to specific points in the sky.\u201cYou can click on what we call a recommended \u2018object\u2019 in the app, and the telescope will automatically focus on it,\u201d said Malvache. \u201cThe app might, for example, suggest something that is \u2018appearing soon,\u2019 or \u2018fading soon.\u2019 It's actually the coolest feature from most users\u2019 points of view. \u201cIn traditional telescopes, the sensor is your eye and the processor is your brain,\u201d he added. \u201cIn our telescopes, the sensor is a camera and the processor is an embedded computer. The eye and the brain are amazing, but they\u2019re not optimized for observing the sky at low light. We use a low-light sensor to provide up to 100 times more light through the eyepiece, to deliver incredibly clear images. We also remove light pollution, meaning you can pull your telescope out of your backpack in a downtown district and stargaze without having to go a remote place. Or hide in an attic.\u201dTaking astronomy out of the attic and making it accessible to people all over the world is exactly what Malvache and Unistellar co-founders Laurent Marfisi, Antonin Borot, and Franck Marchis have been on a mission to do ever since they launched their signature telescope, the eVscope, on Kickstarter in 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially, they experienced suspicion from astronomers, many of whom didn\u2019t think it was a \u201cproper\u201d telescope, but rather a digital camera that was somehow circumventing the traditional way of viewing the galaxy.\u201cA lot of people, including some of my colleagues, thought that I was wasting my time,\u201d said Marchis, who, in addition to being Unistellar\u2019s chief scientific officer, serves as senior planetary astronomer at the SETI Institute in California, a nonprofit dedicated to exploring the origins of life in the universe.\u201cSuddenly, I was giving up on this golden access to big telescopes to work on these tiny devices, which were, in their eyes, not capable of doing much,\u201d he continued. \u201cNow they\u2019ve changed their minds. They all want an eVscope.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly skeptics aside, Unistellar\u2019s initial popularity surprised even its founders. Expecting to move a few hundred units with their first Kickstarter outing, they sold almost 2,000.\u201cIn 2021, we went from storing 5.7 million uploaded images to 27.7 million,\u201d said Malvache, who credits AWS storage and compute services with Unistellar\u2019s ability to grow at such rapid pace.The company now has more than 7,000 customers, largely across North America, Europe, and Japan\u2014part of what Marchis describes as the \u201cbiggest connected network of telescopes in the world.\u201d\u201cWe almost have a full cover range of Earth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re continuously monitoring specific targets such as asteroids, comets, and exoplanets\u2014planets orbiting stars outside of our solar system. If something happens in the sky right now, I can send a message to our network and someone will start observing it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Unistellear Global Network of Citizen Astronomers \n\nThe network Marchis refers to is the Unistellar community of citizen astronomers, who use their eVscopes to record images and gather data on astronomical events, and share it on the cloud with research institutions like NASA and SETI.\u201cWe store the data on AWS, then we analyze the quality,\u201d said Malvache. \u201c\u2018Was the user pointing the telescope in the right direction?\u2019 \u2018Were there any clouds?\u2019 And so on. We do a first analysis of the scientific results on AWS as soon as we receive the data and we give the user a report as quickly as possible. Our users want fast feedback and it encourages them to participate again. The cloud allows us to do this. That's why AWS is really convenient for us.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, these citizen scientists were invited to take part in more than 800 campaigns organized by Unistellar, helping NASA and SETI to fill some of the gaps in their research.\u201cWe have thousands of telescopes working at the same time, in different locations,\u201d said Malvache. \u201cIt means we can see an event from different angles. So, for an asteroid, we can get a sense of its shape, because we\u2019re not only observing it from one vantage point.\u201dIn addition to supporting scientists, Unistellar is putting eVscopes in the hands of a new generation of astronomers. Both the Girl Scouts and U.S. community colleges have bought eVscopes\u2014with the Girl Scouts now offering badges in astronomy, and several community colleges using eVscopes to integrate astronomy into the curriculum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS podcast explores green infrastructure and social justice\n\nLearn how the Urban Systems Lab is using Amazon Web Services to model simulations to help mitigate the impacts of urban flooding driven by climate change on at-risk communities.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOur users are already extremely diverse in terms of gender and nationalities,\u201d said Marchis. \u201cI\u2019d say our greatest achievements so far have been making it easier for people to participate in science and observations, and growing the community of citizen astronomers in different countries. And we want to do more.\u201dAlthough the eVscope is more powerful and easier to use than most traditional telescopes, it\u2019s not yet at a price point that makes it accessible to as many people as its creators would like. But as with the smartphone before it, Unistellar hopes to make the eVscope more affordable as it grows, and ultimately sell it in countries that have historically had limited access to stargazing equipment.A recent partnership on lenses with camera company Nikon could be a \u201cgame changer\u201d in this respect, according to Malvache.\u201cWe have the goal of going to really high volumes in the consumer market,\u201d he said. \u201cNikon has the experience to help us do that.\u201d\u201cWe will have our first eVscope customer in Kenya soon,\u201d added Marchis. \u201cMy dream is that one day we will have our telescopes across sub-Saharan Africa. This new astronomy really is an astronomy for everybody.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nAWSSpaceInnovation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            The astronomy startup opening the night skies for everyone \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","76":"\n\n\nAWS's new tool makes it easy for customers to monitor, analyze, and reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nAs the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is committed to building a sustainable business for our customers and the planet. A new way AWS is fulfilling this commitment is by launching the customer carbon footprint tool, which shows customers how AWS helps to reduce their carbon footprint, compared to on-premises solutions. AWS developed the customer carbon footprint tool to support customers on their sustainability journey.This new tool uses easy-to-understand visualizations to show customers their historical carbon emissions, evaluate emission trends as their use of AWS evolves, estimate the carbon emissions they have avoided by using AWS instead of an on-premises data center, and review forecasted emissions based on their current use. The forecast shows how customers\u2019 footprints will change as Amazon stays on path to powering its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of its original target of 2030, and drives toward net-zero carbon by 2040.\u201cAs we continue to fulfill our commitment to The Climate Pledge and work toward net-zero carbon emissions, we want to give our customers the data they need to measure their carbon footprint and meet their own carbon reduction goals,\u201d said Nat Sahlstrom, director of Amazon Energy. \u201cThe customer carbon footprint tool makes carbon emissions information easy for customers to work with and encourages companies to accelerate their goals, plans, and programs to address the urgency of climate change.\u201dThe launch of the customer carbon footprint tool is part of Amazon\u2019s commitment to The Climate Pledge. Amazon co-founded the Pledge in 2019, becoming the first signatory and setting a goal to meet the Paris Agreement 10 years early\u2014and achieve net-zero carbon by 2040. Signatories to the Pledge agree to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis, and the new AWS tool allows customers to do this, by providing the emissions data and enabling them to easily incorporate it into their annual reporting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Climate Pledge announces 86 new signatories\n\nMore than 200 global businesses, including three new signatories in India, have now joined The Climate Pledge and are pursuing ambitious carbon-reduction activities, including mobilizing their supply chains to tackle climate change.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the carbon footprint tool worksAWS customers migrate workloads from on-premises data centers to AWS for many reasons, from saving money and accelerating innovation, to making their operations more sustainable. In many cases, moving to AWS is more sustainable than supporting on-premises solutions. According to 451 Research, when compared to surveyed enterprise data centers across several geographic regions, AWS can lower a customer\u2019s carbon footprint by nearly 80% today and up to 96% once AWS is powered with 100% renewable energy, by 2025.With the new tool, customers who have set carbon reduction goals can more accurately measure the emissions associated with their use of AWS. The customer carbon footprint tool reports on customers\u2019 corporate emissions, which include their use of AWS, and provides data to show progress toward future reduction targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, historical carbon emissions data is available based on the customer\u2019s AWS use from January 2020 onward. It includes Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Scope 1 emissions come directly from a company\u2019s operations, such as the energy consumed by AWS data centers, while Scope 2 emissions come from the generation of purchased energy, like the electricity used to power Amazon facilities.The tool\u2019s carbon unit of measurement is metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e), an industry-standard. It is \u201cequivalent\u201d because there are multiple greenhouse gases (for example, they include methane and nitrous oxide), and the measurement converts the greenhouse gases to the amount of carbon that would cause equivalent warming. The customer carbon footprint tool is shared through the AWS Billing console and uses carbon data that meets the widely adopted international standard of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which supplies the world's most widely used greenhouse gas accounting standards. When signed into the AWS Billing console, customers can view their carbon emissions data by geographical location and by AWS services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). They can also measure changes in their carbon footprint over time, as they deploy new resources in the cloud.How customers use the toolAWS worked with a range of customers to test and develop the customer carbon footprint tool, including Pinterest, Turbonomic, Veolia, Workday, and Salesforce.The data that AWS provides to Salesforce helps the company understand its climate impacts and enables them to develop plans to avoid, reduce, and compensate for emissions. Salesforce is a signatory of The Climate Pledge and joined Amazon in being a founding member of the LEAF Coalition, which recently reached its goal of $1 billion in public-private finance to protect tropical forests around the world.\u201cImproved AWS carbon footprint data helps us develop better strategies and take better action to avoid and reduce emissions. I\u2019m glad that AWS is providing more and more data about our usage and offering the same tools to all customers,\u201d said Patrick Flynn, senior vice president and global head of sustainability at Salesforce. \u201cWe look forward to seeing the carbon intensity associated with our use of AWS services decrease as we continue to innovate together and as AWS continues to make progress towards their renewable energy and net-zero carbon commitments.\u201d\n\nSalesforce Senior VP of Sustainability Patrick Flynn on Collaborating with AWS | Amazon Web Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinterest\u2019s Workplace Sustainability Manager Mia Ketterling also highlighted the benefits of the carbon footprint tool, \u201cHaving a clear understanding of where your sources of emissions come from is key for any company to build their reduction plan. We are excited to use the customer carbon footprint tool to help us understand our footprint, reduce the impact of our operations, and create a sustainability program that is uniquely Pinterest.\u201dThe carbon footprint tool joins a collection of other AWS tools, including the AWS Well-Architected Sustainability Pillar and AWS Compute Optimizer, that help customers improve performance, reduce costs, and minimize environmental footprint.Learn more about the customer carbon footprint tool.

During live broadcast games, video editors can use \u201cSet Piece Threat\u201d ahead of free kicks and corner kicks to show how much more danger exists in the current matchup compared to the league average or whenever match commentators want to talk about set pieces and the related strength of a team.Skill \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to their exceptional fundamental talent, every player in the Bundesliga brings some specialized skills to the game that complement those of their fellow players and make their team stronger. The new \u201cSkill\u201d Match Fact combines and compares the cumulative stats of every Bundesliga player to assess their skills across different categories. The stat features four player profiles: a \u201cFinisher\u201d who excels at scoring goals (both the number and efficiency); a \u201cSprinter\u201d who generates high maximum speed and can get farther on the field than other players; an \u201cInitiator\u201d who accumulates, assists, and makes a high number of difficult passes that lead to assists; and a \u201cBall Winner\u201d who is able to create a lot of turnovers from the opposing team by winning the ball in a duel or intercepting an opponent\u2019s pass.

The winning player can swing the momentum to their team and directly impact the game\u2019s outcome. Imagine, it\u2019s late in the third period of a close game, and two hockey players are face to face on the ice, waiting for the puck to drop. Everyone is guessing who will get to the puck first. But until now, no one had a comprehensive way to assess who was more likely to win. To close this gap, the National Hockey League (NHL) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) developed Face-off Probability, which uses AI to deliver real-time face-off predictions to analysts, fans, and teams. This is a significant technology development because it\u2019s the first probability stat from AWS that will be seen live before the play, instead of as it happens. During a stoppage in play, Face-off Probability generates predictions for who will win the upcoming face-off based on the players on the ice, location of the face-off, and current game situation. The predictions occur in less than a second and are generated throughout the stoppage until the game clock starts running again. The teams working to tackle the challenge of producing real-time face-off predictions had to build this playbook from scratch. But AWS was uniquely positioned to generate a solution given its record of building data-driven solutions for sports and its deep technology partnership with the NHL, which already produced shot and save analytics in 2021. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying AWS machine learning (ML) to NHL data Building an entirely new system from scratch that can proactively evaluate face-off matchups and predict winners posed significant technical challenges. The NHL and AWS used Player, Puck, and Tracking (PPT) data, and hundreds of thousands of face-offs from over 10 years of historical NHL Hockey Information & Tracking System (HITS) stats. This data source was incredibly varied and complex. It needed to incorporate information like individual historical home and away face-off statistics; head-to-head matchup history; player characteristics such as height, weight, and handedness; and game context such as the location of the face-off, score of the game, and time of the face-off occurring. This combination of historical success rates, player matchup characteristics, and game context brings together HITS and PPT data to provide a complete and unique perspective of face-off dynamics. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS\u2019s inclusive culture inspires individuality and acceptance\n\nDuring Black History Month, Black professionals reflect on positive experiences at AWS.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusting for new face-off matchups Face-off Probability is also flexible, adapting predictions based on changes to the game situation. For example, if a player is waived out of the face-off due to a violation, the model updates the prediction to the new matchup based on the real-time PPT streaming sensor data coming from the rink and from sensors attached to the players. Predictions occur in less than a second and are triggered when there\u2019s a change in players involved in the face-off. A prediction can also show the change in a team\u2019s probability of winning a face-off when the primary center person is waived out of the face-off and replaced with a player with a different probability of success. This highlights the importance of having a particular player in the face-off circle. In addition to providing the probability of the two players facing off, the tool also provides other likely face-off combination pairings that will aid broadcast teams in highlighting potential matchups, which will enrich the viewing experience for fans.

Convenience to get what we want, when we want it, is a benefit of residing in big cities and towns. What if we were able to get whatever we need, and get a chance to stay where we want, to pursue our true passion?Hideo Akibe\u2014also known as Debo\u2014is a member of the Ainu community was born and raised in the remote Akan National Park region of Hokkaido, Japan. As a proud member of the Ainu community, Debo tries to keep his culture alive and share it with the world. In fact, during the closing ceremony of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, he performed an ancient Ainu dance through a video, mesmerizing the world with his grace and aura.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lifestyle of the Ainu community is dependent on the richness of nature. They worship various plants and animals they refer to as \u201cKamui\u201d (gods) who give them blessings of nature and preserve their traditional rituals. Inheriting these traditions, Debo continues to promote the Ainu culture and pass it on to the next generation through woodcarving, lectures, and tourism.\"One of the traditional tools of the Ainu people, who specialize in woodcarving, is the ikupasuy. The tool is used in rituals for drinking, and the Ainu use the ikupasuy to speak to the Kamui of the natural world. The tool is carved from hard, sticky wood such as oak and finished by applying vermilion, yellow, or black lacquer,\" said Debo. In the past, Debo drove to a home improvement store in Kushio City, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) away, to get lacquer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI was wondering what I was going to do when I couldn't obtain the lacquer anymore, and Amazon solved my problem,\u201d Debo said.\u201d It's so convenient that they can deliver to places so far away from the city.

He is an ambitious entrepreneur who has owned his own delivery logistics business, Duality Ventures, since he was 21, putting Kirkland on the map as a successful, young business owner partnering with Amazon to deliver for customers.Entrepreneurship runs in Kirkland's blood, but owning his own business was never a guarantee. His father, Sam Kirkland, is also an entrepreneur and an Amazon Delivery Service Partner (DSP) who expected his son to be independent from an early age. The elder Kirkland said he continuously challenged his son to grow and didn\u2019t offer handouts, only advice.\u201cI gave him a few tips: Get a credit card and only charge what you\u2019d normally spend, put together a savings plan, and create a network of people that you can grow with later in life,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJaren Kirkland stands next to his dad, Sam, who inspired him to become an entrepreneur and an Amazon Delivery Service Partner.\n\nThe younger Kirkland graduated from the University of Michigan at age 20 and wanted to work for his father.

I want you to go off on your own and seek out new experiences that I could never offer you.\u201dAfter a year of working as a consultant in Washington, D.C., Kirkland began to consider becoming an Amazon DSP and business owner like his father. On paper, he had what it took to become an Amazon DSP, but saw his age as a barrier to being taken seriously. Regardless, he channeled his experience being around his family's logistics business growing up and started Duality Ventures and applied for the Amazon DSP program.Amazon accepted him into the program in 2020\u2014over the past two years, he has grown his business from 12 drivers to 80 drivers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat I value most about being a DSP is that I have an opportunity to make a difference in people\u2019s lives through employment,\u201d Kirkland said. \u201cThere are those who may consider it daunting for someone at my age, but I\u2019m honored to be able to lead a team of 80 and demonstrate that Generation Z has so much to offer.\u201dKirkland has coached employees who have been with him since day one and promoted them into management, all while creating a sustainable and profitable business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon, Delivered: From survivor to inspirational entrepreneur\n\nA difficult past didn\u2019t stop Amazon Delivery Service Partner Sophia Strother from realizing her potential, while inspiring others.

When the brand first debuted, it originally took an estimated three to five weeks to deliver customer orders. After launching in Amazon\u2019s store, EPIC Everyday took advantage of Fulfillment by Amazon\u2014Amazon\u2019s service to pick, pack, and ship orders\u2014which enabled customers to receive orders in just one to two days.One of the main challenges for EPIC Everyday has been capital. But that burden has been significantly lessened since the sisters became a part of the Black Business Accelerator (BBA), Amazon\u2019s $150 million commitment to help build sustainable diversity and growth for Black entrepreneurs. Through the program, EPIC Everyday has had access to strategic business guidance and mentorship, and marketing and promotional support. The sisters also secured a grant that helped their business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLong-term for us is to grow this into what we call the \u2018Mocha-Hued Movement,\u2019\u201d said Cara. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a literary series, whether it\u2019s plush dolls that we can provide on Amazon.\u201dJenae added: \u201cWe\u2019re showing our kids that they can do anything they want to. They see that their parents have put their minds to something that is totally different, and they have been successful in doing it. And they\u2019ve been helping us along the way, as well.\u201dFor Cara and Jenae, out of frustration came inspiration, motivation, and eventually satisfaction.\u201cMy hope is that all kids realize that they are empowered, positive, innovative, and creative, just like our slogan is, and they feel like they are important, no matter what,\u201d said Jenae.Shop EPIC Everyday and other Black-owned small businesses selling in Amazon\u2019s store.\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nSmall business Culture and diversityBlack History Month \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            How shopping frustration led to a 'Mocha-Hued Movement'\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","86":"\n\n\n\nAmazon recently pledged support for a new public-private collaboration called Partnership for Zero, which is taking a united approach to dramatically reduce unsheltered homelessness. The coalition is initially focusing on downtown Seattle but will soon expand to target a set of regional communities.Building on efforts that led to the creation of the King County Regional Homelessness Authority (KCRHA), the City of Seattle and King County partnered with We Are In\u2013\u2013an advocacy coalition of philanthropies, businesses, service providers, advocates, and both housed and unhoused King County residents. Together, the public and private entities launched Partnership for Zero to support KCRHA\u2019s goal of reducing homelessness by targeting areas in King County\u2014the most populous county in Washington state, and county in which Seattle sits. Local companies are also supporting the effort and have committed more than $10 million of private contributions in the first year, which includes a donation from Amazon.\u201cAmazon is pleased to support Partnership for Zero as it works to bring together local government, nonprofits, and businesses to continue to address the homeless crisis with urgency and compassion,\u201d said Alice Shobe, global director of Amazon in the Community.The goal is to build a future where homelessness is rare overall, and brief when it occurs, by combining resources and investing in targeted infrastructure and capacity. The coalition hopes to put every person experiencing unsheltered homelessness on the path toward permanent housing.The KCRHA is a new administration created in 2019 and co-funded by the City of Seattle and King County. The authority implements a coordinated, county-wide approach to solving homelessness and is independently operated under the leadership of CEO Marc Dones. Addressing homelessness at a regional level is a new approach for Washington state, but it is a proven and successful model in other parts of the country.The Partnership for Zero model is designed to quickly react, adjust in real time as lessons are learned, and demonstrate success in a targeted area, using a combination of public and private resources. Downtown Seattle currently holds the largest concentration of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness in King County, so Partnership for Zero will initially focus in that area, expanding to other communities in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon launches $2 billion Housing Equity Fund \n\nAmazon\u2019s Housing Equity Fund is a $2 billion commitment to preserve and create more than 20,000 affordable homes by 2025 in Washington State\u2019s Puget Sound region, the Arlington, Virginia region, and Nashville, Tennessee. \n\n\n\n\nWatch now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartnership for Zero is one of the many ways Amazon is involved in addressing housing issues in the Puget Sound region and elsewhere.

These are three places where Amazon has a sizable and growing presence.Along with the Amazon Housing Equity Fund, Amazon has provided an additional $100 million in cash and in-kind donations to its nonprofit partner Mary\u2019s Place to build the largest family shelter in Washington state.

Will my work be recognized at its fair value?\u2019\u201dTouzi, who is originally from Cameroon in Africa, quickly learned that at Amazon, the answer to his two questions was a resounding \u201cyes.\u201d He felt welcomed by all employees and never like an outsider. He also never experienced any problems with English not being his native language.As AWS has grown, so have organized efforts around inclusion, diversity, and equity. Amazon now boasts 13 affinity and diversity groups, whose presence can be traced back to groundwork laid by the Black Employee Network affinity group, or BEN.Established in 2005, BEN\u2019s primary purpose has been to provide a support structure for Black employees at Amazon and to champion inclusion and diversity throughout the company and across the globe.\u2018Not OK with the status quo or performative change\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngelina Howard, senior product manager, AWS Industry Products\n\nAngelina Howard, former president and current advisor for BEN, said AWS has been one of BEN\u2019s biggest supporters. She\u2019s happy to see the AWS Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity (ID&E) team celebrate Black culture opportunities for Black employees via programs like BEN Rise Leadership and Management Leaders for Tomorrow (MLT).\u201cThe AWS ID&E team does a great job empowering Black culture internally and externally,\u201d Howard said. \u201cFor example, in 2020 AWS spearheaded a video forum series called \u2018Courageous Conversations,\u2019 which provided a safe space for employees to discuss [the] racial trauma that the Black community was feeling in 2020.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Forbes is recognizing this Amazon leader\n\nAngelina Howard followed her passion to support employees, customers, and communities during a difficult year.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoward, who transitioned to AWS from the Amazon Consumer organization in 2021, has led initiatives resulting in grants for Black-owned businesses during COVID-19 and helped create a Black Excellence Gala that benefitted organizations dedicated to STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education. She also helped create BEN Startup Week, a week-long series of events promoting Black entrepreneurship and innovation; the BEN Scholarship Program for students; and BEN Rise, an eight-month program that helps accelerate the success of future Black leaders at Amazon.While these and similar programs and initiatives are effecting real change across the organization, Howard appreciates that there\u2019s always more work to do. Howard\u2019s optimism about the future is similar to the enthusiasm that\u2019s common among AWS builders\u2014a feeling that innovation never slows and there\u2019s no limit to how far your ideas can take you.\u201cThere is still work that needs to be done and leaders recognize that. I have seen AWS senior leaders create goals and mechanisms to not only increase representation, but also make the culture inclusive for existing employees,\" Howard said. \"AWS leaders are not OK with the status quo or performative change.\u201dAttracting diverse talent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEbony Taylor, inclusion, diversity, and equity leader at AWS\n\nEbony Taylor led a team dedicated to inclusive initiatives to intentionally drive equity in talent decisions and attract diverse talent. Taylor now leads the Builder Engagement team on the Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity team and is proud of its three main focus areas: Learning and inclusion: providing learning products to educate builders on inclusion and equityCommunity engagement: creating STEM pathways in underserved communities to transform the future of technologyEquity experience: providing programming and solutions to reimagine the experience of diverse talent throughout the employee lifecycleBlack representation across Amazon is on the rise, and our commitment to continuing this upward trajectory is steadfast.\u201cIf all Amazonians looked the same with the same lived experiences,\u201d Taylor said, \u201cwe would struggle to think more broadly and holistically and create products and solutions for all customers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Williams, AWS senior technical account manager  \n\nBeyond Amazon\u2019s internal efforts to grow representation, AWS Senior Technical Account Manager David Williams especially appreciates efforts that encourage and support youth of color to pursue STEM education and alternative learning programs. His hope is that young people of color have opportunities to study computer programming, web design, cybersecurity, and other technology fields in the same way students in high school study trades to become an auto mechanic, electrician, HVAC technician, and more.\u201cToo often in the world we live in, college is the only way in\u2014but not everyone can attend college or is suited for that,\u201d Williams said.This is precisely the intent behind programs like the Amazon Future Engineer Class Chats, where Amazon and AWS professionals volunteer to share their personal career journeys with K-12 students and answer questions about careers in tech. AWS Worldwide Specialists Account Manager Brandon Middleton began volunteering for the program in 2020 and has given Class Chats to hundreds of students from fifth to 12th grades, with many more scheduled in 2022. He\u2019s also secured nearly $40,000 in contributions for Bay Area STEM nonprofits where he volunteers.Middleton, who has an MBA from UC Berkeley and a B.S. in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said he cares deeply about fixing the opportunity gap in the tech industry so that historically underserved communities get access to participate in STEM-related careers.Inclusive culture\u2014and tech\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrandon Middleton, AWS worldwide specialists account manager\n\nAWS Technologist Diya Wynn has dreamed of a tech career since she was in the third grade, which is when she got her first computer. She said that computer helped her imagine a future of opportunities that looked nothing like what she\u2019d seen or grown up around.After nearly 30 years influencing products and delivering services for early- and growth-stage companies, she joined Amazon expecting to experience the same challenges that Black women working in tech often face. She said the supportive and accepting community she found at AWS was a refreshing departure from what she\u2019d come to expect in corporate working environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiya Wynn, AWS technologist \n\nAWS\/Amazon has growing communities of like-minded individuals throughout the company. There are affinity and common interest groups that are central to the vibrant community I've experienced and been active in,\" Wynn said. \"The way we talk about inclusion here\u2014trusted, valued, connected, and informed\u2014requires acceptance, and building an inclusive culture is always an area of focus.\u201dEver since Wynn joined AWS, she\u2019s had opportunities to influence organizations, shape programs, and impact how they\u2019re delivered. She said she\u2019s been able to accomplish this at a scale and scope far beyond what she\u2019s been able to do at previous organizations, thanks to the inclusive culture at AWS.\u201cI'm also proud of the impact we can now make helping organizations build safe, fair, and equitable systems and products with artificial intelligence (AI),\u201d Wynn said. \u201cThis can move people and organizations to use their power and influence to create space and advantage for others. That\u2019s building inclusive tech and something to be proud of.\u201dCommunities for learning and buildingCommunity is something Senior Software Development Engineer Jenee Benjamin has found through various ways across AWS. She\u2019s participated in workshops about topics ranging from Amazon\u2019s promotion process to technical problem-solving challenges for engineers.

Each time I had a community around me, I thrived and it was easy for me to give my best effort in those settings,\u201d Benjamin said. \u201cCommunity is a place of support and a place to feel comfortable being yourself\u2014these are the conditions that many people need in order to flourish, myself included. People can find inspiration, mentors, and friends when they find community.\u201dBenjamin has represented AWS at various conferences such as the Grace Hopper Conference, the National Society of Black Engineers\u2019 professional conference, Afrotech, and AWS\u2019s re:Invent 2021, where she talked about some of the new Athena features her organization had developed. She enjoys these opportunities where she\u2019s able to show that there are successful Black women software engineers.\u201cThere are Black women at AWS who thrive, and AWS is investing in careers for Black people. My management gives me opportunities to work on the most challenging projects, to show off my work, and to grow in many roles,\u201d Benjamin said. \u201cThe BEN community is an amazing community to get mentoring and to get support for growing professionally.

Everything in traditional\u2014as opposed to quantum\u2014computing is based on information as a combination of zeros and ones. When you think about it, it\u2019s like these two digits underwrite almost everything we do.A two-minute snack I loved as a kid is celery and peanut butter with whole raisins on top. It tastes amazing. I still make it now as a treat.My favorite celebrity duo is Tom Holland and Zendaya. I think they\u2019re really cute.How would I spend a 22-minute work break right now? I\u2019ve got an 9-month-old chocolate Labrador puppy called Cato, so it has to be taking him for a walk.Two of the best things about working at AWS are the sense of community and the constant innovation.

Wine and cheese. Peanut butter and chocolate. Espresso and milk. My head and a pillow.If I could take a 22-minute break right now, I\u2019d get on my Peloton and do one of their great 20-minute workouts or two 10-minute ones.If I had to name a favorite duo, I\u2019d say Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, probably because I\u2019m watching the Last Dance at the moment. Also, Jim Zorn and Steve Largent, the legendary NFL players. I\u2019m a big Seahawks fan.Two of the best aspects of my job are my team and my business partners.

The plant is expected to generate up to 28,000 megawatt-hours (MWh) of renewable energy per year, which equals the annual electricity consumption of over 8,000 average South African homes.The solar plant consists of over 24,000 bifacial solar panels\u2014capturing sunlight on both sides\u2014covering an area of 20 hectares in the Northern Cape. The solar panels track the sun throughout the day, absorbing solar energy from the sky and reflected light from the ground. The design will result in avoiding an estimated 25,000 tons of carbon emissions annually, the equivalent of removing 5,400 cars from the road in South Africa.\u201cAmazon is committed to working with governments and utility suppliers around the world to help bring more renewable energy projects online,\" said Nat Sahlstrom, director of energy at Amazon Web Services. \"We\u2019re honored to work with the Department of Minerals and Energy, the National Energy Regulator of South Africa, and Eskom to help deliver a new model for renewable energy generation in South Africa.\"Powering energy and economic transformationThe Northern Cape solar project also contributes to the region\u2019s economic transformation.

That also means such infrastructure is a major factor in urban flooding. One solution could be green infrastructure.Amazon Web Services\u2019 (AWS) podcast Fix This recently welcomed Christopher Kennedy, assistant director of the Urban Systems Lab, and research fellow Pablo Herreros Cantis, to discuss green infrastructure and the technology aiding their research. They say green infrastructure has the potential to address environmental injustices and help vulnerable populations by reducing urban flooding risks related to climate change. \n\n\n\n'Fix This' podcast\n\nEpisdoe #47: Environmental justice and green infrastructure solutions with Urban Systems Lab\n\n\n\n\nListen now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn general, in a lot of U.S. cities, there's a long history of banking institutions, mortgage institutions, not providing the resources for certain communities,\u201d said Kennedy. Herreros added: \u201cAnd it has been shown already, with relative consistency, that formerly redlined neighborhoods and neighborhoods that have a higher percentage of minority populations have more impervious surfaces.\u201dThe Urban Systems Lab, which is based at The New School in New York City, focuses on research and providing new insight into developing more equitable, resilient, and sustainable cities. The Lab is focused on helping municipal governments better plan where to implement green infrastructure investments. Through the Lab\u2019s Environmental Justice and Green Infrastructure Research project, a project supported by the Kresge Foundation\u2019s CREWS program, Kennedy and Herreros are currently working with local non-governmental organizations, such as Groundwork USA, and communities in the U.S. The implementation of green infrastructure to address issues such as flooding provides several ecological functions\u2014including infiltration, evaporation, and other natural processes\u2014to handle storm water that would otherwise flow into urban drains or sewers. Through green infrastructure, water is instead absorbed by soil or moved below the surface, or it evaporates.The team is currently examining the disproportionate effects of urban flooding and climate change on minority and low-income communities in four small- and medium-sized U.S. cities: Syracuse and Yonkers, New York; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Elizabeth, New Jersey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHerreros said the Lab selected the cities based on commonalities, including, \u201cWe were looking for locations in which we were going to be able to connect with organizations or municipal governments that would be interested in collaborating.\u201dSocioeconomic factors that create vulnerabilities also play a role in urban flooding, such as poverty, a lack of health insurance, and access to green space. Kennedy and Herreros note that when existing social disparities overlap with extreme weather events, they can compound harmful outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS machine learning in art sparks beautiful logic \n\nWhat becomes possible when an artist wields the tools of machine learning\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Urban System Lab integrates those social variables into its analysis and proposed solutions. The Lab takes an interdisciplinary approach by bringing together designers, scientists, and practitioners to work on complex questions about how cities interact with different ecological, technological, and social systems.When Herreros initiated model simulations to investigate the root causes for why urban flooding more heavily impacts certain communities, he quickly realized that the simulations would require more computational power to complete the project and accelerate the research. With support from the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) and AWS Promotional Credits, the Lab\u2019s simulations now run on the AWS Cloud.\u201cWhat we have so far been exploring in our work is focused on the distribution of current flood risk,\u201d Herreros said. However, he noted: \u201cIt's not only what is happening now, it's also where are we heading and how we need to consider that we need to make very cautious decisions on how to adapt climate change in a way that doesn't leave anyone behind.\u201dTo learn more, visit AWS Sustainability Customer Stories for a multimedia look at how AWS customers are building in the cloud to innovate, expedite, and scale real-world sustainability solutions.Subscribe to Fix This on Spotify to stay up to date on the latest Fix This episodes, featuring customers from around the world that use AWS to solve some of the world\u2019s most pressing challenges.\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nAWSCommunityInnovation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            AWS podcast explores green infrastructure and social justice\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","93":"\n\n\nUpskilling initiative helps military veterans and spouses transition to cloud computing careers through paid learning and training\u2014no technical experience required.\n\nBrittany Wilkins is a former police officer and deputy sheriff, the owner of two much-loved French bulldogs, an active member of the U.S. Air Force Reserves, and now, a data center technician in training.

From an early age, Wilkins would watch her father, who works in IT, \u201cdoing things with computers.\u201d She just hadn\u2019t thought of tech as a viable career option for herself or connected it with her passion for helping people.\u201cI had this image of working by myself, fixing things. I didn't really see the correlation with supporting clients that I see now,\u201d said Wilkins.Wilkins secured a place on the Data Center Technician path of the apprenticeship program. Currently, she\u2019s working through an instructor-led training course. That means that while she\u2019s studying and working, professional trainers guide her and her group through everything they need to know to achieve the certifications required to move to the next stage. The next stage is getting inside a real data center for 9\u201312 months for on-the-job training. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very hands-on role,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what really attracts me. I want to learn all I can, especially about hardware, and maybe one day cross over into software. I think eventually I\u2019d like to get into network engineering or cloud security. I like the idea of ensuring that people and their information stay safe.\u201dCourtney Sampson Associate solutions architect, North Carolina \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter an early career in banking, Courtney Sampson joined the U.S. Air Force as a way to get into tech, but he was placed into weather forecasting. While he found this somewhat technical, it was not the career he wanted to pursue. When his military contract ended, he decided to explore other routes into the tech world.Sampson\u2019s AWS apprenticeship was his first step into a technology career. \u201cIt was something like a fire hose of information coming in,\u201d he said. \u201cThe broadness and vastness of the technology landscape was just mind-blowing.\u201d Before starting the apprenticeship, Sampson said he had no idea what a solutions architect (SA) was and only limited knowledge of AWS technology. He quickly learned that AWS is an enormous enterprise and solutions architects have a broad role in which they touch a lot of technologies and work with a wide variety of customers. Sampson completed his apprenticeship in 2020 and is now employed full time by AWS. His role is to guide different AWS customers on their cloud journey. He advises them on which services to use, helps them build applications, and shows them the \u201cart of the possible\u201d in the cloud.Today, he continues to find his role interesting and challenging. In the immediate future, he wants to keep building his knowledge. \u201cI\u2019m grateful that programs like this exist,\u201d said Sampson. \u201cI'm not sure how else I would have gotten into this career without this opportunity. Most jobs require some sort of experience, but AWS really takes a risk by investing in people who don\u2019t necessarily have the right technical background, but do have the approach to leadership that Amazon looks for. I really only made it this far because of AWS\u2019s support.\u201dEmma NgSolutions architect apprentice, North Carolina\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n As a military spouse, Emma Ng moves frequently to support her husband\u2019s career. Initially, she found pursuing her own career challenging. That changed in April 2021, when she joined the AWS apprenticeship program. Currently living in North Carolina, Ng just graduated as a solutions architect. It\u2019s a role that can be done from anywhere, meaning she can use her newfound expertise wherever she moves in the United States.\u201cA lot of times, military bases are in remote areas, so there are not many job opportunities,\u201d she said. \u201cAWS designed this program to be 100% remote, so when military spouses move, we can take our job with us and not have to worry about finding something new.\u201d Prior to joining the program, Ng\u2014who studied food science, chemistry, and math at college, and speaks Japanese\u2014had been doing business development for a startup, focusing on the Asia\u2013Pacific region. \u201cI had very little technical experience, unless you consider sending emails technical,\u201d she said.Ng heard about the AWS apprenticeship from her brother, a Marine Corps veteran who graduated from the program four years ago. \u201cBefore he got the apprenticeship, he\u2019d set his sights low as to what he could do once he transitioned out of the military,\u201d said Ng. \u201cWorking at AWS and having people around him who were interested in his success really helped him grow. He started to set much higher goals. It had such a positive impact on his life\u2014financially, physically, and emotionally.\u201d \u201cThe learning curve on the apprenticeship is very steep,\u201d said Ng. \u201cBut it's also rewarding because you look back and say, \u2018Eight months ago, I didn't know anything, and now I can have a conversation with a customer, understand their needs, and help develop a solution.\u2019\u201d Ng said that her biggest takeaway from the program was learning to be more comfortable with failing and failing fast. \u201cAWS really encourages that,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we approach a problem, we try a solution. If that doesn\u2019t work, we try a different one. It wasn't something I was used to, but it inspires creativity. If you're not afraid to fail, you're not afraid to think of new solutions or try new things.\u201d Ng is excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. \u201cI\u2019m specifically interested in security in the cloud and protecting customers against cyberattacks,\u201d said Ng. \u201cAt AWS, people have been so supportive and encouraging, saying, \u2018anything you want to do, there are mentors and people out there to help you. That's really cool.\u201dIf you or someone you know is interested in applying to the AWS Technical Apprenticeship program, which recently expanded beyond military veterans and their spouses, visit the website for more information.\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nAWSUpskillingMilitaryMilitary spouse \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            AWS hires 1,000th apprentice for technical training program \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","94":"\n\n\n\"An Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis is the beginning of a long and complicated journey, and I think Alexa has been a priceless tool in my toolkit in managing it.\"\n\nWhen couples marry and commit to one another in sickness and in health, they promise that no matter what happens, they\u2019ll look after one another.

Four years later, she met her husband-to-be, Keba, a native of the San Francisco Bay Area. Since then, the two have built a life together, raising their two daughters and launching a business within the community.That business is Red Bay Coffee. Coffee isn\u2019t just that morning pick-me-up for Keba and Rachel. Coffee represents opportunity\u2014to take a moment to slow down and reflect, to participate in the coffee culture, and to gather energy for whatever comes next.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCoffee is that moment in the morning when I get to reset,\u201d said Keba. \u201cI warm up that water, weigh out my coffee, grind it. [It\u2019s] my daily ritual.\u201dWith that in mind, in 2014 the two founded Red Bay Coffee. The pair started the company in their home, and were able to build their business with the support of family and friends and an initial crowdfunding campaign. For Keba, as an African American, owning his own business and succeeding holds deep value.\u201cIt gives you the opportunity to not only direct your life and your future and your destiny, but you\u2019re also able to have a positive impact on your community,\u201d Keba said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDriven by Keba and Rachel\u2019s unwavering leadership, Red Bay Coffee is now at the forefront of what they refer to as the \u201cfourth wave of coffee\u201d\u2014a firm commitment to ensure our coffee is not only high-quality and sustainable, but a vehicle for diversity, inclusion, social and economic restoration, and entrepreneurship.\"We have made room for inclusion and diversity in the specialty coffee industry,\u201d Keba said. \u201cWe ethically source, we roast it, and brew it. That\u2019s really our ethos: making specialty coffee more accessible to more people.\u201dRed Bay sources directly from countries with the unique combination of climate and elevation required for high-grade specialty coffees, and seeks to empower and support local growers\u2019 entry into specialty coffee.After quickly becoming a staple of the community with its tagline \u201cBeautiful Coffee to the People,\u201d Red Bay\u2019s brick-and-mortar presence grew beyond just being another neighborhood coffee joint. The brand\u2019s public roastery in Oakland became a community hub, hosting events such as food pop-ups, concert residencies, magazine releases, panel discussions, and self-care festivals. However, when COVID-19 struck in 2020, the community that Keba and Rachel cultivated was in jeopardy.\"A lot of businesses were devastated,\u201d Keba said. \u201cOurs was impacted heavily. We had to close down a lot of our shops. We had to reconnect with our customers in other ways. And the first and most direct pathway was through ecommerce.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor many small businesses, ecommerce became a lifeline in the wake of the pandemic. Keba and Rachel saw the pandemic as an opportunity to reach their existing customers in new ways, while also leveraging their selling partnership with Amazon to enable a much broader audience to discover Red Bay Coffee.\u201cAmazon played an important role in that pivot when we had to reconnect with our customers,\u201d Keba said.Like many of Amazon\u2019s nearly 2 million selling partners, most of which are small and medium-sized businesses, Red Bay pivoted to online sales and thrived, growing nearly 100% year over year from 2020 to 2021. Red Bay recently joined Amazon\u2019s Black Business Accelerator, a $150 million commitment to help build sustainable diversity and growth for Black entrepreneurs by enabling their success as sellers in Amazon's store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecoming her own boss, with the help of Amazon\n\nAngel Johnson\u2019s \"gym fashion\" faux pas turned into a fast-growing small business by selling in Amazon's store.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeba and Rachel aim to showcase their backgrounds and history through the brand\u2019s label and package design, while also drawing inspiration from the origin countries for each roast. Keba and Rachel are intentional about eliminating barriers and creating opportunities for people, including those who may need a second chance.\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do with my life after incarceration. When I met Keba and Rachel, they put their trust in me, and welcomed me into their home, it felt like a new beginning,\u201d said Jessie Llarinas, coffee trainer and tech manager at Red Bay Coffee. \u201cMy experience with Red Bay has helped me to grow and learn new things. Keba and Rachel believed in me and I am grateful to be where I am today.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, Red Bay employs almost 50 people, from baristas and roasters to quality control managers and marketing team members. Both Keba and Rachel take pride in having built a business that not only provides great coffee, but also opportunities for people from all walks of life, many of whom may have never considered a career in the coffee industry.\u201cAs we grow our business in scale and geography, we look forward to folks paying a visit, taking pride, feeling welcome,\u201d Keba said. \u201cAnd if we do that, then we know we\u2019ve done something right.\u201dShop Red Bay Coffee and other Black-owned small businesses selling in Amazon\u2019s store.\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nCulture and diversityBlack History Month Small business \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            Bringing 'Beautiful Coffee to the People' by selling in Amazon\u2019s store \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","97":"\n\n\nAmazon recognizes Black History month by highlighting Black-owned small businesses, along with Black creators, celebrities, authors, and employees.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Black History Month theme is Black is remarkable.

LOVE. Listen to Stevie Wonders' album, Songs in the Key of Life, and you will understand.What does \u201cBlack is remarkable\u201d mean to you? A cosmos of expression and intention. It's our resilience and diverse points of view. Our willingness to sacrifice for our kids and family. The way we acknowledge one another through good and challenging times. The way we celebrate each other's wins.What Black creators, organizations, or movements inspire\/empower you? Afrofuturism and hip-hop are movements that inspire and excite me. In particular, the art of Nyame Brown, Chelle Barbour, and Afroscope. Their art practices are both empowering and motivating.As a multi-disciplined artist who works in analog and digital mediums, Afrofuturism allows me to blend hip-hop and abstraction to create art that reflects the energy of the Pan-African diaspora. Based in Seattle, Na Wari is a fantastic arts organization that provides space for Black people to explore all facets of our culture through events, shows, historic preservation, and Black ownership by connecting through art.What is one area where you are particularly excited to see the Black community driving culture and innovation? A global Black renaissance is happening now. You can see it everywhere, from architecture, technology, fashion, lifestyle, medicine, and more. Our diasporas are as varied as any other, and it shows. I'm excited to see people from the Black community invest, innovate, develop, produce, and distribute our creativity.I love seeing Black entrepreneurs create products and services that disrupt and redefine industry categories. What advice would you give to other aspiring Black creators? If you do something well that positively impacts others, do more of it daily. Ask someone you could see yourself becoming in 10 to 20 years to be your mentor. Build your dream by sharing your knowledge and stories with other Black creators. Interact and learn about people from different cultures. Listen to your instincts (heart)\u2014practice, practice, practice.What impacts do you want your work to have on future generations? I hope my work impacts the mindset of future generations. Take action on their dreams.

For Nikolaus, a lifetime space enthusiast, it\u2019s a dream fulfilled.Recently, we spent time with Nikolaus to learn more about this project, as well as his own personal journey and passions.Tell us about your own Amazon journey.I joined Amazon over five years ago and have helped more than 30 partners\u2014including Sonos, Ford, and Bose\u2014integrate Alexa into their devices. I\u2019ve also spent a few years working on the foundation of Alexa behaviors and visuals on our own Echo and Echo Show devices. Currently, I\u2019m focused on creating bar-raising voice experiences for our customers on Earth and in space.Tell us more about this project and sending Alexa to space.I\u2019ve personally been working on this project for the last three years. It\u2019s a collaboration with Lockheed Martin to integrate Alexa into the crew cabin of NASA\u2019s Orion spacecraft for Artemis I. While this first mission, expected to launch this spring, is uncrewed, it is helping NASA test technology that could be used in future crewed missions to the Moon and other space destinations.Our team has been working on features an astronaut might need during a mission. The first is access to mission telemetry, and that requires the ability to answer questions like, \u201cAlexa, how fast is Orion traveling?\u201d or \u201cAlexa, what\u2019s the temperature in the cabin?\u201d The second is the ability to control connected devices onboard the spacecraft, such as in-cabin. The last is ensuring Alexa can retrieve information from back on Earth, like news briefings or sports scores, helping astronauts stay connected to home during long missions to deep space. Lockheed Martin made the custom, space-grade hardware with Alexa built-in, and the Amazon team handled all of the acoustic, audio-processing, and software work required to bring the experience to life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 'Star Trek' computer was part of the original inspiration for Alexa\u2014is this project an example of the team bringing this vision to fruition?Absolutely! We want everyone to be able to use Alexa everywhere, and Alexa in space is an exciting next step. It shows that Alexa can be helpful in yet another environment outside the home, and there\u2019s no place more challenging than space. There are no guarantees of what happens next, but we\u2019re already seeing how Alexa can potentially help astronauts and others in mission control\u2014making missions simpler, more efficient, and more enjoyable for those onboard.The technology we are building for this project will have applications on Earth, too. For example, the Alexa integration onboard uses our Local Voice Control technology, which allows Alexa to function in areas with limited-to-no connectivity, and the learnings here will help Alexa work better in cars and other remote environments. This isn\u2019t a new idea\u2014in fact, Velcro was created for the Apollo mission.What are some of the biggest challenges your teams faced, and how did you overcome them?First, this is a new domain for Alexa, so as a user-experience designer, I needed to dive deep and research everything there is to know about using voice in space and how we can help future astronauts. I got to talk with multiple astronauts about their jobs and uncover what mission-specific information and features would be most helpful for them. I also traveled to NASA\u2019s facilities in Houston and brainstormed with their flight controllers and directors to ensure the experiences we were building were both relevant and accurate.Second, as you can imagine, space isn\u2019t an easy environment to work in. You\u2019re dealing with shock and vibration, radiation exposure, weight limits, and the unique acoustic properties of an enclosed metal crew-cabin traveling through space. Our team of engineers had to research the acoustic properties of the cabin and understand the sound quality of an actual spacecraft in flight. Lockheed Martin played a huge role here, given their long history of building hardware for space. That gave us a solid platform where we could apply our expertise in voice technology and AI.Lastly, this was a huge project with lots of ambiguity. There are so many aspects of this project that we\u2019ve never done before\u2014from user experience and marketing to building with space-grade materials. It\u2019s been very exciting to take on a variety of tasks and tackle these new challenges. For example, one week I\u2019m working on the industrial design of the speaker grill and light ring, and the next week I\u2019m defining the response logic for reading the telemetry values coming back from flight software.It\u2019s been a long and challenging project, but the team has done an incredible job inventing and executing.How can customers experience Alexa in space?Alongside the upcoming Artemis I mission, Alexa-enabled devices on Earth will be able to provide customers with in-depth information on Artemis I, such as telemetry data from the Orion spacecraft; videos and imagery from the mission, including a launch livestream; video of virtual crew interactions from Johnson Space Center, and reminders and notifications about key milestones in the mission. The new Artemis features for Alexa will launch closer to the mission, but a preview is available now. Just say, \u201cAlexa, take me to the Moon,\u201d or check out www.amazon.com\/alexainspace.We understand in your free time you create space-themed comics for your kids. Tell us more about that.Space has always been a passion of mine, so when I was approached to work on this project, I jumped at the opportunity. Storytelling with visuals, such as wireframes and storyboards, is a natural part of my job to remove ambiguity, but I\u2019m always looking for new, fun ways to keep my creative skills sharp. When my son, who is also very into space, headed to his first day of preschool, I decided to put a small drawing of an astronaut in his lunchbox and he absolutely loved it. Now, I have two sons, ages 2 and 4, and have created over 400 drawings for their lunches. Even when I head down to Houston for work, I draw a few before I leave so they always have a smile for lunch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTell us more about your background.In college, I studied both graphic design and computer science. I have always been drawn to the intersection of art and technology and how it can be used to help and connect people. Before joining Amazon, I worked for a handful of companies, including Thomson Reuters, Target, and Microsoft. I also co-founded a small startup. One of our products enabled people to enjoy the photos taken at events like weddings without having to pull out their phone, by streaming them to big screens for everyone to enjoy. I\u2019m originally from Wisconsin, but for the last nine years I have lived in Seattle with my wife and two sons. When I\u2019m not reading up on the latest space tech, I\u2019m out playing tennis, wine tasting, or at home putting our pizza oven to use.\n\n\n\n\n                            Related Tags\n\nAlexaInnovationSpace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 min\n        \n\n\n\n\n                            Reading:\n                        \n\n                            Alexa prepares for liftoff\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Share\n\n\n\nTwitter Share\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Share\n\n\nEmail Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories we think you\u2019ll like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview some of the best deals for the first-ever Amazon Pet Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SNAP benefits can be used by Amazon customers in nearly every U.S. state \r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet two family-owned and female-led Amazon DSPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","99":"\n\n\nTo support Amazon employees and the Filipino communities devastated by Typhoon Rai\/Odette, we have implemented a series of initiatives.\n\nTyphoon Rai\/Odette hit the shores of the Philippines in December, leaving many people in the province of Cebu\u2014including Amazon employees and the wider community\u2014in a state of peril.As part of Amazon\u2019s commitment to its employees and the communities in which it operates, Amazon has implemented a series of initiatives to help the Filipino community through these difficult times. The initiatives include financial support, mental well-being programs, and partnerships with nonprofits driving relief efforts.Financial support for our peopleTo aid our associates and employees in Cebu, we have created the Amazon Philippines Rai\/Odette Relief Fund to offer an Emergency Response Grant and Property Damage Grant. With these programs, impacted employees and associates can administer repairs to their home, pay security deposits for new homes, replace damaged appliances and furniture, and repair or replace their vehicles.Amazon has also extended its Social Security Systems calamity loan assistance package to cover those impacted in Mimaropa, Western Visayas, Central Visayas, Eastern Visayas, Northern Mindanao, and Caraga regions of the Philippines. Those areas are impacted by to Typhoon Rai\/Odette, according to a declaration from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council.Ensuring physical and mental well-beingAmazon has extended its group medical insurance to ensure that associates are able to get relevant medical treatments for any aliments or injuries sustained due to the typhoon. The typhoon\u2019s impact on the mental health of our community is also of utmost importance to us, so Amazon has extended our Employee Assistance Program to provide our associates and their loved ones with free and confidential support, resources, and counseling.Employees coming togetherAmazon teams in Manila have been collecting essential supplies\u2014food items, toiletries, and drinking water\u2014and helping deliver them to affected colleagues in Cebu.

They met, got to know one another, fell in love, and had their fairytale wedding\u2014but unlike most love stories, Alexa was part of their story every step of the way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is their story, in Brent\u2019s words:The first dateWe think it\u2019s kind of funny that Alexa was an ongoing part of our relationship\u2014in fact, Danielle and I sometimes joke that Alexa is the only reason she came over to my house for our first date and is why we\u2019re together.I had one of the original Echo devices, back when you had to be invited to purchase one. Danielle is a developer, and a big technology fan, so she wanted to get one. When she wasn\u2019t selected, she learned I had one, she came over to my house to try it out.She spent part of our first date asking Alexa random questions, just to see how it reacted. She wanted to see if she could stump Alexa with questions, and wanted to explore the different things it could do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet Belle, Alexa\u2019s 103-year-old best friend\n\nHow Alexa is helping one customer stay connected with the world around her.\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposalAlexa was such a big part of our first date, so I knew when the time came to propose, Alexa had to be a part of it. I planned a vacation to Mexico, and I brought an Echo device along for the trip. I actually went out and bought the device just before the trip, and I remember Danielle even asking me why we needed another one.At home, we use Alexa on a daily basis, and part of our routine is listening to our morning flash briefing. Sneakily, I had built a flash briefing skill that linked to a blog post I wrote. That blog post contained my proposal.When the time was right, Danielle asked Alexa for the flash briefing, and Alexa started speaking. It started off like a regular flash briefing\u2014but it started getting specific. I was trying to play it cool, and we were both sort of just looking at our phones, listening to Alexa in the background. However, as Alexa kept speaking, it started to recount our history as a couple, playing music that was special to us, and telling inside jokes. It took Danielle a few minutes, but she soon realized what was happening.She was so excited\u2014she quickly said yes, and then she immediately asked Alexa to start the flash briefing over again. She\u2019d only been half paying attention, expecting her usual flash briefing, so of course we needed to hear it again!Having Echo as my wingman, Danielle didn\u2019t hesitate to say yes.The wedding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen our wedding came around, it only made sense for Alexa to be a part of it.We were brainstorming ways that Alexa could be a part of our special day. Eventually, we decided that the best place for Alexa on our wedding day was as our cake topper. We did a buffet of desserts, and standing in the middle of it all were two Echo devices we\u2019d bought just for the occasion. \u00a0When the wedding was over, we gifted those two Echo devices to our best man and maid of honor, as a thank you for standing with us on the big day.The happily ever afterWe have several Echo devices and supporting smart devices, like lights and Fire TV, all around our home. Our favorite is still the Echo, which has become a bit of a fun, ongoing theme for us as a couple.We regularly use Alexa in our daily lives. We always look forward to new Alexa-enabled devices and the possibilities they can bring to our smart home automation and quality of life.We love that Alexa could be an important part of Brent and Danielle\u2019s love story\u2014and beyond.
