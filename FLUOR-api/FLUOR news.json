(NASDAQ: SV) (Spring Valley). Fluor has invested more than $600 million in NuScale Power since 2011 to help bring its technology to market. The proposed transaction is anticipated to close in the first half of 2022 subject to customary closing conditions. Upon completion of the transaction, Fluor projects to own approximately 60 percent of the combined company, based on the PIPE investment commitments received and the current equity and in-the-money equity equivalents of NuScale Power and Spring Valley. Fluor expects that the proposed transaction will bolster and accelerate the path to commercialization and deployment of NuScale Power s unique small modular nuclear reactor technology, said Alan Boeckmann, executive chairman, Fluor. This is the next step in Fluor s plan, first outlined 10 years ago, to work closely with NuScale Power, Congress and the Department of Energy to commercialize this unique carbon-free energy technology. Today s announcement is further evidence that cost-shared government funding to build first-of-a kind commercial scale technology can attract private investment and yield results. Fluor will continue to serve as an important partner by providing NuScale Power and its clients with world-class expertise in engineering services, project management and supply chain support, Boeckmann said. NuScale Power is the developer of the only SMR technology that has received Standard Design Approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). After merging with Spring Valley, the combined company will become the first and only publicly-traded company focused on development of advanced SMR technology. NuScale Power s innovative, carbon-free nuclear power solution offers clients safe, scalable and deployable 77-megawatt modules in configurations of four, six or 12 modules. The SMR technology can be integrated into electric grids to complement existing renewable energy sources and provide ongoing, consistent and reliable baseload power. Fluor, together with NuScale Power, continues to advance the first SMR cost-reimbursable services contract with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS). UAMPS awarded Fluor a contract in January 2021 to provide estimating, development, design and engineering services for its Carbon-Free Power Project.

Revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion and net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Fluor was $19 million, or $0.14 per share. Consolidated segment profit for the quarter was $129 million compared to $79 million a year ago. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $80 million. New awards for the third quarter were $1.7 billion and ending backlog was $27.8 billion. Corporate general and administrative expenses for the quarter were $68 million which included foreign currency transaction losses of $30 million and investigation expenses of $19 million in the quarter. With today s 10-Q filing, Fluor is now current with its financials, said Carlos Hernandez, Fluor s chief executive officer, While 2020 has provided a lot of unexpected challenges for our business, we are pleased to report that for the third consecutive quarter, we have had no material project execution charges. Outlook Although Fluor has suspended its guidance for 2020, the company expects to report fourth quarter results and 2021 guidance to the investment community in February 2021. The company expects its cash balance to remain around $2 billion through the end of the year. COVID-19 continues to impact our business as clients are deferring capital investment decisions and the pandemic has slowed down our ability to fully staff and execute projects. Business Segments The Energy & Chemicals segment reported profit of $95 million in the third quarter of 2020 up from $85 million in the third quarter of 2019. Segment profit for the quarter improved primarily due to increased activity on a liquefied natural gas project and favorable foreign currency transaction gains. New awards were $141 million and backlog is $11.6 billion. The Mining & Industrial segment reported profit of $18 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $57 million in the third quarter of 2019. Revenue and segment profit in the quarter decreased due to deferred execution activities on a few large mining projects due to COVID-19. New awards were $268 million including the influenza and antivenom cell culture facility in Australia for Seqirus. Third quarter ending backlog is $4.8 billion. The Infrastructure & Power segment reported profit of $6 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $1 million in the third quarter of 2019. Lower margin contributions from certain infrastructure projects for which charges were recognized during 2019 continue to adversely impact near term segment profit margin. In the third quarter, Fluor terminated its contract with the Maryland Department of Transportation for the Purple Line Project and removed the project from its backlog. New awards were $683 million including the Oak Hill Parkway for Texas Department of Transportation. Third quarter ending backlog is $5.6 billion. The Government segment reported profit of $26 million in the third quarter of 2020, up from $22 million in the third quarter of 2019. Results include new awards of $188 million and ending backlog is $3.4 billion. The Diversified Services segment reported a segment profit of $7 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $11 million in the third quarter of 2019. Stork divested EQIN, its equipment rental business in Europe, in the third quarter. New awards were $469 million in the quarter and ending backlog is $2.3 billion. The Other segment, which is comprised of NuScale and the Radford and Warren government projects, reported a loss of $23 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to a loss of $97 million in the third quarter of 2019. NuScale expenses in the third quarter of 2020 were $22 million. Remaining backlog in the segment is $145 million. Discontinued Operations Results from discontinued operations, which includes the held-for-sale AMECO equipment business, were immaterial. During the quarter, Fluor sold its AMECO Jamaica business for $18 million net of working capital and recognized a loss of $1 million. The company expects to complete the sale of the remaining AMECO business within the first half of 2021. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This news release contains a discussion of consolidated segment profit from continuing operations that would be deemed a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC rules. Segment profit is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests excluding the following: corporate general and administrative expense; impairment, restructuring and other exit costs; interest expense; interest income; domestic and foreign income taxes; other non-operating income and expense items; and earnings from discontinued operations. The company believes that consolidated segment profit from continuing operations provides a meaningful perspective on its business results as it is the aggregation of individual segment profit measures that the company utilizes to evaluate and manage its business performance. A reconciliation of consolidated segment profit from continuing operations to earnings from continuing operations before taxes is included in the press release table.

(COOEC-Fluor) fabrication yard in Zhuhai, China, has safely completed the entire module program for the Kuwait Integrated Petroleum Industries Company (KIPIC) Al-Zour project in Kuwait. The COOEC-Fluor yard completed the modular program over a period of 24 months from the start of steel fabrication to load out of the last modules, said Chris Vertanness, vice president and director of operations at the yard. The COOEC-Fluor team has accomplished numerous fabrication and logistics milestones on this project working closely with the Fluor-led joint venture team, and I look forward to continuing to show the world what our yard can do. To achieve this milestone, COOEC-Fluor delivered 188 modules in 20 separate shipments with a combined weight of 65,000 metric tons. In addition, the yard fabricated more than 95,000 pipe spools of carbon, alloy and stainless steel pipe which will be installed by the project team at the site. Leveraging COOEC-Fluor for fabrication and modular assembly was a key component in the KIPIC project s overall execution strategy. By performing large-scale modularization at the fabrication yard, field labor at the project site was significantly reduced resulting in greater cost efficiency, enhanced safety performance, and minimized strain on the local labor market. The project was executed with a relentless focus on health, safety and environmental performance, achieving a total case incident rate of 0.06 and a lost-time injury rate of 0.02. The final module shipment of 8,600 metric tons was shipped from COOEC-Fluor and recently arrived at the project site in Kuwait. Fluor is leading a joint venture that is working to deliver two engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction packages for key process support units, utilities and infrastructure for the Al-Zour refinery project in Kuwait. Upon completion, the new complex is expected to be one of the largest refineries in the world and produce 615,000 barrels of oil per day.

Stork is a global provider of maintenance, modification and asset integrity services associated with large existing industrial facilities in the oil and gas, chemicals, petrochemicals, industrial and power markets. Founded in 1827, Stork has built a powerful brand in the industry and has long-term relationships with a diverse range of blue chip customers. It has operations in Continental Europe, United Kingdom, the Middle East, Asia Pacific and the Americas, with an annualized run-rate revenue of approximately 1.6 billion ($1.7 billion) and EBITDA of approximately 100 million ($109 million), implying a transaction multiple of just under seven times EBITDA. The acquisition of Stork is consistent with Fluor s goal to further enhance our integrated solutions capabilities in thoughtful, strategic ways that will increase the value we deliver to our clients and shareholders, said Fluor s Chairman and CEO David Seaton. We are pleased to welcome Stork s talented workforce of more than 15,000 employees, which will provide us with additional flexibility and capacity to increase our maintenance and direct construction activities. Stork is highly complementary to Fluor as it gives both businesses the opportunity to market diverse services and capabilities to new customers and across new geographies. Stork s business is largely driven by ongoing operating budgets and is therefore less impacted by volatile commodity prices. In addition, Stork s continuous site presence will help us improve our ability to meet our customers needs throughout the full lifecycle of an operating plant, and provide Fluor with an ongoing earnings stream and robust growth opportunities, Seaton added. According to current Stork CEO Arnold Steenbakker, We are very proud that a world-class company like Fluor recognizes Stork s strong reputation, capable workforce and performance as a global industrial services provider. The combination will create new opportunities to expand our global footprint and deepen the product and services offering to our customers. Stork s activities are complementary to those of Fluor and the combination will create a global leader in the industrial services business. Upon closing of the acquisition, Fluor will begin combining Fluor s Operations & Maintenance organization with Stork. Current Stork CEO, Arnold Steenbakker, will lead the combined group and report directly to Fluor s CEO, David Seaton. The management team will be formed by Stork s existing management combined with the managers of Fluor s Operations & Maintenance business. The combined group, branded Stork and headquartered in the Netherlands, will have an annual turnover of approximately 2.1 billion ($2.3 billion) and a total of approximately 19,000 employees. The acquisition is expected to be accretive to Fluor s earnings per share in 2016. Fluor expects to achieve significant synergies including increased revenues from cross-selling and expansion into new markets. The transaction multiple would be under six times Stork s EBITDA including run-rate revenue synergies. Fluor intends to fully finance the cash required for the transaction through the issuance of debt in international markets. The acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2016 and is subject to regulatory approvals and consultation procedures with Stork s work council.

This project represents a significant investment in first-of-a-kind engineering and design certification for small modular reactors in the United States. Through a five-year cost-share agreement, the DOE will invest up to half of the total project cost with the project s industry partners matching this investment by at least one-to-one. The specific total will be negotiated between the DOE and NuScale and will be derived from the total $452 million identified for the Department s Small Modular Reactor Licensing Technical Support program. Fluor and NuScale continue to be approached by numerous entities, and are evaluating potential investors, manufacturers and other supply chain partners for future potential SMR development efforts. Fluor is extremely pleased by the DOE s funding decision in favor of NuScale s innovative SMR technology, said Dave Dunning, Fluor s group president, Global Business Development & Strategy. The determination by a panel of independent experts that NuScale s SMR technology offers tremendous potential to produce safe, reliable, scalable power validates the same conclusion reached by Fluor when we initially decided to invest and support NuScale s commercialization efforts. Fluor made its investment in NuScale Power in October 2011 prior to the announcement of the DOE cost-sharing program.

Three design concepts and corresponding budgets were presented to the public by the Authority and New York s Governor Andrew Cuomo on December 5, 2012, in Albany. Tappan Zee Constructors submission, shown as Proposal One, was recommended at that time by the Selection Committee. Today, the Authority s Board of Directors made the final selection of the Tappan Zee Constructors proposal. Based on its 30 percent ownership of the joint venture, Fluor will book its portion of the project into backlog once the contract receives final approval and a notice to proceed is issued. \"The combined experience of our team enabled us to put forward an attractive and cost competitive design,\" said Steve Dobbs, president of Fluor s Industrial & Infrastructure Group. \"We also will be able to leverage our recent successful bridge construction experiences, like the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, and our unique equipment capabilities in making this important project a reality.\" The 3.1-mile-long Tappan Zee Bridge connects Rockland County to Westchester County in the Lower Hudson Valley (approximately 25 miles north of midtown Manhattan) and is a vital transportation link that serves approximately 138,000 vehicles per day. The mega-project will be the single largest bridge project in New York s history. It is the state s first application of its recently enacted design-build legislation and has produced substantial savings relative to the $5.2 billion estimated cost. The Fluor team developed a unique and innovative design that reduced the weight of the structure and minimized the number and size of foundations required. The design solution also utilizes a shallow superstructure and a 350 long-span design to minimize the number of piers and provide a sleeker looking bridge that enhances the view corridors within the lower Hudson Valley. The main span is a composite deck cable-stayed structural system with outwardly inclined main span towers that create an iconic look and accommodate future transit loads. The design will allow for dredge quantities to be reduced from 1.8 million cubic yards to less than one million cubic yards, lessening environmental impacts, costs, and schedule durations. In addition, the construction schedule will benefit from utilizing unique heavy lifting equipment that Fluor and its partner American Bridge own and had custom built for the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge project. Construction will take approximately five years with completion projected for 2018.

Fluor is the managing partner of the approximately $1.4 billion design and construction contract working with The Lane Construction Corp. The company will book the entire contract amount in the fourth quarter 2007. Work will begin in spring 2008 with the new lanes opening in 2013. Today s agreement is the culmination of more than five years of work among numerous local, private, regional, state and federal entities. Fluor and Transurban formed Capital Beltway Express LLC as the operating entity for the 80-year concession management of the I-495 HOT Lanes. Transurban will be the majority owner of the concession company with a 90 percent share and Fluor will be a 10 percent minority owner. The Capital Beltway HOT Lanes project will provide Northern Virginia drivers with an improved Capital Beltway and a key part of the overall solution for addressing regional congestion, said Fluor Senior Vice President Patrick Flaherty. At a time when we are seeing high levels of interest from many states to team with the private sector to deliver badly needed infrastructure improvements, the I-495 Capital Beltway Project is certain to become a model for smart and effective use of Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) in the U.S. We applaud the leadership demonstrated by the Virginia Department of Transportation to work in partnership with Fluor and Transurban to bring this signature project to financial close. Our focus has been and will continue to be on delivering a project that gives new choices to Capital Beltway drivers. Our approach is to do it safely while minimizing traffic impact and delays during construction. Frankly, we will be here long after the final layer of asphalt is applied and we want the new HOV and HOT lane users to have a good experience from ground-breaking to ribbon-cutting and beyond, said Fluor Vice President of Operations Herb Morgan. The project includes improvements and replacement of a significant portion of the aging infrastructure along a 14-mile stretch of the Capital Beltway in northern Virginia. In addition to improving the existing roadway, Fluor and Lane will construct four, new HOT lanes in the center section of the interstate. Vehicles with three or more passengers, buses and emergency vehicles will use the HOT lanes at no charge. Drivers with fewer passengers can choose to pay a variable toll to use this new express service. Existing free lanes will adjoin the HOT lanes. The project will include: Two new lanes in each direction from the Springfield Interchange to just north of the Dulles Toll Road; First-time introduction of HOV to the Beltway and Tysons Corner; Congestion-free network for transit service on the Beltway; Replacement of more than $250 million of aging infrastructure, including replacement of 42 bridges and overpasses; Upgrades to 11 key interchanges; Construction of more than 70,000 linear feet (13 miles) of soundwalls to double existing protection for local neighborhoods; Construction of Springfield Interchange Phase VIII to create a seamless HOV network on I-95\/395, Capital Beltway, I-66, the Dulles Toll Road and future HOV lanes on Braddock Road; Improved connection at I-66 to improve traffic flow onto the Beltway; and Three new access points to the Capital Beltway at Rt. 29\/Lee Highway, Westpark Bridge and Jones Branch Drive. More than 200,000 drivers a day use this stretch of the I-495 Interstate. The planned improvements on the Beltway will give commuters new options to more quickly reach their destination. Highway design modifications will increase traffic capacity and safety while minimizing the impact to neighboring homes and businesses.

The conversion of the notes into the company's common stock is contingent upon the share price reaching approximately $72.72, or a premium of 30 percent of the conversion trigger price of $55.94. Fluor announced today that it has exercised its right under the convertible notes indenture to pay in cash the principal amount of the notes presented for conversion. Any stock appreciation amount above the conversion trigger price of $55.94 will be satisfied by the company through the issuance of common stock. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, \"Earnings per Share\" had been widely interpreted to allow the exclusion of common shares underlying contingently convertible debt instruments from the calculation of diluted earnings per share until the contingent conversion share price is reached (in Fluor's case, when the share price reaches approximately $72.72). In late 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force of the Financial Accounting Standards Board reached a final consensus that the accounting for contingent convertible instruments should follow the same accounting treatment as traditional convertible instruments -- the \"if converted\" method of accounting -- and that the potential dilutive effect of the instrument should be included in diluted earnings per share immediately upon its issuance, but that principal amounts that must be settled entirely in cash may be excluded from the computations. This consensus becomes effective December 31, 2004. Fluor irrevocably elected to pay the principal amount of the convertible debentures in cash, and, therefore, there will be no dilutive impact until the average stock price exceeds the conversion trigger price of $55.94. Fluor will then use the treasury stock method of accounting for the difference between the market stock price in a quarter and $55.94. The shares required to cover this difference will be included in calculating diluted earnings per share. Previously reported diluted earnings per share for the first, second, and third quarters of 2004 will not change as a result of the application of the consensus. \"This election to pay the principal amount of the notes in cash is in line with Fluor's capital structure management strategy and reflective of our financial strength and business outlook,\" states Michael Steuert, Fluor Corporation's senior vice president and chief financial officer.

Fluor and its consortium partner, Lukoil Neftegazstroy (LNGS), have signed a lump-sum turnkey engineering, procurement and construction contract for the project, which is expected to be complete in December 2004. LNGS is Lukoil's construction affiliate. Value of the contract to Fluor is $330 million. The terminal will enable Lukoil to export additional quantities of crude and oil products annually by December 2004. \"Fluor is very pleased to be working together with Lukoil Neftegazstroy to build this interesting and important project for Lukoil,\" said Jeff Faulk, Fluor's group president of Oil, Gas & Power. The project includes two tank farms, a marine jetty, a railroad station and dredging in the Gulf of Finland to allow for the passage of double-hulled crude and product ice-breaker tankers. The project will comply with the stringent international environmental standards set by the World Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission and the International Maritime Organization.

Fluor was also Lukoil's exclusive financial consultant for the project. In this capacity, Fluor assisted Lukoil to structure and arrange the project's long-term financing. Financing consists of a 12-year, $225-million loan from HBK Fund LP, based in Dallas, Texas, to \"RPK -- Vysotsk LUKOIL II,\" the special purpose company owning the terminal.

As a result of its recent reverse spin off of Massey Energy, the \"stub\" period will reflect a charge for the conversion of existing \"old\" Fluor stock-based awards to \"new\" Fluor stock-based awards. Depending on the final closing price on December 31, Fluor expects the charge will be in the range of $13 million to $17 million after-tax, or $.17 to $.22 per share. Additionally, the company indicated that its first fiscal quarter, ending March 31, 2001, is expected to be in the range of $.35 to $.40 per share. Although the volume of new awards has been increasing, and the outlook remains encouraging, there is a time lag in the recognition of earnings resulting from recent bookings, particularly from large, multi-year projects. First quarter results also will be impacted by the ramp-up in expenses related to implementation of Fluor's new SAP system. Fluor confirms the full year expectation of $2 per share, with positive trends in new project bookings. This momentum will more positively impact earnings in the second half of the year.

Global prospects for American Equipment's continued growth offer additional investment opportunities. Even though American Equipment has proven to be an excellent source of income, the company concluded that continued ownership in the current form is not strategically essential to Fluor Daniel's engineering and construction activities. The company's strategic alternatives analysis will determine whether increasing shareholder value is best served by continued ownership of and investment in American Equipment, or by some form of divestiture or restructuring. The company expects that it will conclude its analysis within 120 days. In the event of any sale or restructuring, the company intends to apply the after-tax proceeds to the repurchase of its stock, if market conditions remain appropriate. The company remains optimistic about growth prospects for its businesses. The key focus for Fluor Daniel's engineering, construction, maintenance and technical services businesses will be to improve margins through selectivity, project execution and cost management. To increase profitability, Fluor Daniel has implemented a number of new initiatives, including the elimination of matrix decision-making, strengthening of sales and marketing to enhance selectivity, and the consolidation of several operating units to further reduce overhead expenses. A.T. Massey will continue to build on its present growth strategy through self-funded investment in Central Appalachia coal properties, as well as other opportunities for broader utilization of its technical and operational expertise. Pending completion of its strategic analysis, the company's capital budget for fiscal year 1998 has been set at approximately $450 million, which, based on current cash-flow projections, can be funded from internally generated operating cash flow. This level compares with approximately $650 million in fiscal year 1997. During the past three years, the company has invested approximately $1.5 billion in the growth of its Fluor Daniel and A.T. Massey units. The establishment of a base-load level for the 1998 capital budget is consistent with the company's enhanced focus on selectivity and is considered to be sufficient to support future earnings growth. In addition to any share repurchases which may occur as a result of strategic actions, the company intends to continue its ongoing share repurchase program. Since the beginning of this calendar year, the company has repurchased approximately 950,000 shares. In order to continue this program, the Fluor Corporation Board of Directors has supplemented the company's unused share repurchase authorization to a new total of 10 million shares. The company's financial condition remains strong. Cash and marketable securities balances at year-end 1997 were in excess of $300 million, and approximately $300 million in long-term debt represented less than 15 percent of total long-term capital. This financial strength gives the company the flexibility to continue to invest in selected capital expenditures and acquisitions, while maintaining a strong credit rating. The company's financial condition serves as a solid foundation upon which to enhance its competitive advantages, invest for future earnings growth and launch its strategic initiatives which are focused on enhancing shareholder value. Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR) is a global engineering, construction and diversified services company with an investment in low-sulfur coal. NOTE: Any of the comments in this press release that refer to the company's estimated or future results, including its statements concerning projected operating profit for fiscal 1998, margins on existing or future projects, long-term profitability and demand and growth trends for A.T. Massey, are forward-looking and reflect the company's current analysis of existing trends and information. Actual results may differ materially from current expectations or projections based on a number of factors affecting the company's businesses. The company's estimates of future performance depend on, among other things, the likelihood of receiving certain new awards. While these estimates are based on the good faith judgment of management, these estimates frequently change based on new facts which become available. In addition, the timing of receipt of revenue by the company from engineering and construction projects can be affected by a number of factors outside the control of the company. The dollar amount of the company's backlog as stated at any given time is not necessarily indicative of the future earnings of the company related to the performance of such work. Cancellations or scope adjustments related to contracts reflected in the company's backlog can occur. The company's businesses are also subject to fluctuations in demand and to changing global economic and political conditions which are beyond the control of the company and may cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements. Additionally, coal operations produce a commodity which is internationally traded and the price of which is established by market factors outside the control of the company. Other risk factors affecting the company's estimated or future results include, but are not limited to, cost overruns on fixed, maximum or unit priced contracts, contract performance risk, the uncertain timing of awards and revenues under contracts, project financing risk, credit risk, risks associated with government funding of contracts, market conditions impacting realization of investments, market conditions in the domestic and international coal market and relatively mild weather conditions which may lower demand for steam coal. These forward-looking statements represent the company's judgment only as of the date of this press release. As a result, the reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. The company disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning these and other factors can be found in press releases as well as the company's public periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the discussion under the heading \"Certain Factors and Trends Affecting Fluor and its Businesses -- Forward-Looking Statements\" in the company's Form 8-K filed May 6, 1997.
