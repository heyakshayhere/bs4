"Mar 05, 2020",Allergan Receives FDA Approval for DURYSTA™ (bimatoprost implant) the First and Only Intracameral Biodegradable Sustained-Release Implant to lower Intraocular Pressure in Open-Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension Patients,", /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE: AGN), a leading global pharmaceutical company with more than 70 years of heritage in eye care, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the company's New Drug Application (NDA) for DURYSTA™ (bimatoprost implant) 10 mcg for intracameral administration. With this approval, DURYSTA™ becomes the first intracameral, biodegradable sustained-release implant indicated to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT).  ""Today's FDA approval marks a breakthrough milestone for the glaucoma community and provides a much-needed option for patients challenged with topical drops or needing alternative options,"" said David Nicholson, Chief Research and Development Officer, Allergan. ""At Allergan, our mission is to contribute meaningful strategies that help preserve people's vision, while ensuring that therapies are mindful of the realities of administration and compliance. As a commitment to the ongoing development of this innovation, Allergan has five ongoing Phase 3 studies with DURYSTA™ to support further potential FDA label enhancement and rest of the world approvals.""  The FDA approval is based on results from the two 20-month (including 8-month extended follow up) Phase 3 ARTEMIS studies evaluating 1,122 subjects on the efficacy and safety of DURYSTA™ versus twice daily topical timolol drops, an FDA accepted comparator for registrational clinical trials, in patients with OAG or OHT. In the two Phase 3 ARTEMIS studies, DURYSTA™ reduced IOP by approximately 30 percent from baseline over the 12-week primary efficacy period, meeting the predefined criteria for non-inferiority to the study comparator.  ""Millions of people are living with glaucoma, one of the leading causes of vision loss; however, new treatment options are needed to help doctors and patients better manage this disease,"" said , M.D., Ph.D., Distinguished Professor of Ophthalmology and Vice-Chair for Technology, Director Clinical Research Unit, , . ""The ARTEMIS trials demonstrated that DURYSTA™ lowered IOP in patients by approximately 30 percent and demonstrated a duration of effect through the 12-week primary efficacy period. As the first FDA-approved intracameral, biodegradable sustained-release implant providing continuous drug delivery, DURYSTA™ has the potential to significantly shift the paradigm for treating glaucoma.""  With the launch of DURYSTA™, Allergan proudly expands availability of Allergan EyeCue®, a proven reimbursement service for eye care professionals to facilitate patient benefit verification, savings program enrollment for eligible patients, and prior authorization (PA) assistance for Allergan Eye Care products.  About DURYSTA™    DURYSTA™ is a prostaglandin analog indicated for the reduction of IOP in patients with OAG or OHT.  DURYSTA™ is an ophthalmic drug delivery system for a single intracameral administration of a biodegradable implant containing 10 mcg bimatoprost. DURYSTA™ should not be re-administered to an eye that received a prior DURYSTA™. DURYSTA™ is preloaded into a single-use applicator to facilitate the administration of the biodegradable implant directly into the anterior chamber of the eye.  INDICATIONS AND USAGE    DURYSTA™ (bimatoprost implant) is indicated for the reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT).  IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION    CONTRAINDICATIONS    DURYSTA™ is contraindicated in patients with: active or suspected ocular or periocular infections; corneal endothelial cell dystrophy (e.g., Fuchs' Dystrophy); prior corneal transplantation or endothelial cell transplants (e.g., Descemet's Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty [DSAEK]); absent or ruptured posterior lens capsule, due to the risk of implant migration into the posterior segment; hypersensitivity to bimatoprost or to any other components of the product.  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS    The presence of DURYSTA™ implants has been associated with corneal adverse reactions and increased risk of corneal endothelial cell loss. Administration of DURYSTA™ should be limited to a single implant per eye without retreatment. Caution should be used when prescribing DURYSTA™ in patients with limited corneal endothelial cell reserve.  DURYSTA™ should be used with caution in patients with narrow iridocorneal angles (Shaffer grade ? 3) or anatomical obstruction (e.g., scarring) that may prohibit settling in the inferior angle.  Macular edema, including cystoid macular edema, has been reported during treatment with ophthalmic bimatoprost, including DURYSTA™ intracameral implant. DURYSTA™ should be used with caution in aphakic patients, in pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule, or in patients with known risk factors for macular edema.  Prostaglandin analogs, including DURYSTA™, have been reported to cause intraocular inflammation. DURYSTA™ should be used with caution in patients with active intraocular inflammation (e.g., uveitis) because the inflammation may be exacerbated.  Ophthalmic bimatoprost, including DURYSTA™ intracameral implant, has been reported to cause changes to pigmented tissues, such as increased pigmentation of the iris. Pigmentation of the iris is likely to be permanent. Patients who receive treatment should be informed of the possibility of increased pigmentation. While treatment with DURYSTA™ can be continued in patients who develop noticeably increased iris pigmentation, these patients should be examined regularly.  Intraocular surgical procedures and injections have been associated with endophthalmitis. Proper aseptic technique must always be used with administering DURYSTA™, and patients should be monitored following the administration.  ADVERSE REACTIONS    In controlled studies, the most common ocular adverse reaction reported by 27% of patients was conjunctival hyperemia. Other common adverse reactions reported in 5%?10% of patients were foreign body sensation, eye pain, photophobia, conjunctival hemorrhage, dry eye, eye irritation, intraocular pressure increased, corneal endothelial cell loss, vision blurred, iritis, and headache.  Please see link to full prescribing information  For more information about DURYSTA, visit www.DURYSTAhcp.com  About Glaucoma    Glaucoma is one of the primary causes of irreversible vision loss and blindness. An estimated 70 million people globally are living with glaucoma. This progressive disease is characterized by elevated IOP. Uncontrolled, elevated IOP causes damage to the optic nerve and loss of vision. Reduction of elevated IOP is the only proven way to slow the progression of vision loss associated with glaucoma.  Current treatments to lower IOP include topical medications (eye drops), laser trabeculoplasty, minimally invasive glaucoma surgery and incisional surgery. Eye drop medications are a standard first-line treatment for open-angle glaucoma, the most common form, but low patient adherence to these medications is common – up to 80 percent of patients are not using topical medications as prescribed. Poor adherence to glaucoma medication could result in disease progression and vision loss.  About Allergan Eye Care    As a leader in eye care, Allergan has discovered, developed, and delivered some of the most innovative products in the industry for more than 70 years. Allergan has launched over 125 eye care products and invested billions of dollars in new treatments for the most prevalent eye conditions including glaucoma, ocular surface disease, and retinal diseases such as diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion.

BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic may cause serious side effects that can be life threatening. Get medical help right away if you have any of these problems any time (hours to weeks) after injection of BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic: • Problems swallowing, speaking, or breathing, due to weakening of associated muscles, can be severe and result in loss of life. You are at the highest risk if these problems are pre-existing before injection. Swallowing problems may last for several months • Spread of toxin effects. The effect of botulinum toxin may affect areas away from the injection site and cause serious symptoms including: loss of strength and all-over muscle weakness, double vision, blurred vision and drooping eyelids, hoarseness or change or loss of voice, trouble saying words clearly, loss of bladder control, trouble breathing, and trouble swallowing  There has not been a confirmed serious case of spread of toxin effect away from the injection site when BOTOX® has been used at the recommended dose to treat chronic migraine, severe underarm sweating, blepharospasm, strabismus, or when BOTOX® Cosmetic has been used at the recommended dose to treat frown lines, crow's feet lines, and/or forehead lines.  BOTOX® is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used: • To treat overactive bladder symptoms such as a strong need to urinate with leaking or wetting accidents, a strong need to urinate right away, and urinating often in adults 18 years and older when another type of medicine (anticholinergic) does not work well enough or cannot be taken • To treat leakage of urine (incontinence) in adults 18 years and older with overactive bladder caused by a neurologic disease who still have leakage or cannot tolerate the side effects after trying an anticholinergic medication • To prevent headaches in adults with chronic migraine who have 15 or more days each month with headache lasting 4 or more hours each day in people 18 years or older • To treat increased muscle stiffness in elbow, wrist, finger, thumb, ankle, and toe muscles in people 18 years and older with upper and lower limb spasticity • To treat increased muscle stiffness in children 2 to 17 years of age with upper limb spasticity • To treat increased muscle stiffness in children 2 to 17 years of age with lower limb spasticity, excluding spasticity caused by cerebral palsy • To treat the abnormal head position and neck pain that happens with cervical dystonia (CD) in people 16 years and older • To treat certain types of eye muscle problems (strabismus) or abnormal spasm of the eyelids (blepharospasm) in people 12 years and older  BOTOX® is also injected into the skin to treat the symptoms of severe underarm sweating (severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis) when medicines used on the skin (topical) do not work well enough in people 18 years and older.  BOTOX® Cosmetic is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used to temporarily improve the look of moderate to severe frown lines between the eyebrows, crow's feet lines, and forehead lines in adults.  It is not known whether BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic are safe or effective to prevent headaches in patients with migraine who have 14 or fewer headache days each month (episodic migraine).  It is not known whether BOTOX® is safe or effective to treat increased stiffness in upper limb muscles other than those in the elbow, wrist, fingers, and thumb, or in lower limb muscles other than those in the ankle and toes in people 18 years and older. BOTOX® has not been shown to help people perform task-specific functions with their upper limbs or increase movement in joints that are permanently fixed in position by stiff muscles.  It is not known whether BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic are safe or effective for other types of muscle spasms or for severe sweating anywhere other than your armpits.  It is not known if BOTOX® Cosmetic is safe or effective for use more than 1 time every 3 months.  BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic may cause loss of strength or general muscle weakness, vision problems, or dizziness within hours to weeks of taking BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic. If this happens, do not drive a car, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities.  Do not receive BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic if you: are allergic to any of its ingredients (see Medication Guide for ingredients); had an allergic reaction to any other botulinum toxin product such as Myobloc® (rimabotulinumtoxinB), Dysport® (abobotulinumtoxinA), or Xeomin® (incobotulinumtoxinA); have a skin infection at the planned injection site.  Do not receive BOTOX® for the treatment of urinary incontinence if you: have a urinary tract infection (UTI) or cannot empty your bladder on your own and are not routinely catheterizing. Due to the risk of urinary retention (not being able to empty the bladder), only patients who are willing and able to initiate catheterization post-treatment, if required, should be considered for treatment.  In clinical trials, 36 of the 552 patients had to self-catheterize for urinary retention following treatment with BOTOX® compared to 2 of the 542 treated with placebo. Patients with diabetes mellitus treated with BOTOX® were more likely to develop urinary retention than nondiabetics.  In clinical trials, 30.6% of patients (33/108) who were not using clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) prior to injection, required catheterization for urinary retention following treatment with BOTOX® 200 Units as compared to 6.7% of patients (7/104) treated with placebo. The median duration of post-injection catheterization for these patients treated with BOTOX® 200 Units (n = 33) was 289 days (minimum 1 day to maximum 530 days) as compared to a median duration of 358 days (minimum 2 days to maximum 379 days) for patients receiving placebo (n = 7). Among patients not using CIC at baseline, those with MS were more likely to require CIC post-injection than those with SCI.  The dose of BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic is not the same as, or comparable to, any other botulinum toxin product.  Serious and/or immediate allergic reactions have been reported, including itching, rash, red itchy welts, wheezing, asthma symptoms, or dizziness or feeling faint. Get medical help right away if you experience symptoms; further injection of BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic should be discontinued.  Tell your doctor about all your muscle or nerve conditions such as ALS or disease, myasthenia gravis, or Lambert- syndrome, as you may be at increased risk of serious side effects including difficulty swallowing and difficulty breathing from typical doses of BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic.  Tell your doctor if you have any breathing-related problems. Your doctor may monitor you for breathing problems during treatment with BOTOX® for adult spasticity or for detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition. The risk of developing lung disease in patients with reduced lung function is increased in patients receiving BOTOX®.  Cornea problems have been reported. Cornea (surface of the eye) problems have been reported in some people receiving BOTOX® for their blepharospasm, especially in people with certain nerve disorders. BOTOX® may cause the eyelids to blink less, which could lead to the surface of the eye being exposed to air more than is usual. Tell your doctor if you experience any problems with your eyes while receiving BOTOX®. Your doctor may treat your eyes with drops, ointments, contact lenses, or with an eye patch.  Bleeding behind the eye has been reported. Bleeding behind the eyeball has been reported in some people receiving BOTOX® for their strabismus. Tell your doctor if you notice any new visual problems while receiving BOTOX®.  Bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infections (common colds) have been reported. Bronchitis was reported more frequently in adults receiving BOTOX® for upper limb spasticity. Upper respiratory infections were also reported more frequently in adults with prior breathing related problems with spasticity. In pediatric patients treated with BOTOX® for upper limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infections were reported more frequently. In pediatric patients treated with BOTOX® for lower limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infection was not reported with an incidence greater than placebo.  Autonomic dysreflexia in patients treated for overactive bladder due to neurologic disease. Autonomic dysreflexia associated with intradetrusor injections of BOTOX® could occur in patients treated for detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition and may require prompt medical therapy. In clinical trials, the incidence of autonomic dysreflexia was greater in patients treated with BOTOX® 200 Units compared with placebo (1.5% versus 0.4%, respectively).  Tell your doctor about all your medical conditions, including if you: have or have had bleeding problems; have plans to have surgery; had surgery on your face; weakness of forehead muscles; trouble raising your eyebrows; drooping eyelids; any other abnormal facial change; have symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) and are being treated for urinary incontinence (symptoms of a urinary tract infection may include pain or burning with urination, frequent urination, or fever); have problems emptying your bladder on your own and are being treated for urinary incontinence; are pregnant or plan to become pregnant (it is not known if BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic can harm your unborn baby); are breastfeeding or plan to (it is not known if BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic passes into breast milk).  Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Using BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic with certain other medicines may cause serious side effects. Do not start any new medicines until you have told your doctor that you have received BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic in the past.  Tell your doctor if you have received any other botulinum toxin product in the last 4 months; have received injections of botulinum toxin such as Myobloc®, Dysport®, or Xeomin® in the past (tell your doctor exactly which product you received); have recently received an antibiotic injection; take muscle relaxants; take allergy or cold medicines; take sleep medicine; take aspirin-like products or blood thinners.  Other side effects of BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic include: dry mouth, discomfort or pain at injection site, tiredness, headache, neck pain, eye problems: double vision, blurred vision, decreased eyesight, drooping eyelids, swelling of your eyelids, dry eyes; drooping eyebrows; and upper respiratory tract infection. In people being treated for urinary incontinence other side effects include: urinary tract infection, painful urination, and/or inability to empty your bladder on your own. If you have difficulty fully emptying your bladder after receiving BOTOX®, you may need to use disposable self-catheters to empty your bladder up to a few times each day until your bladder is able to start emptying again.

As an ambassador for the 'My Glaucoma' campaign, Miller will address the misunderstandings and impact of glaucoma and encourage those with the disease, and their caregivers, to take early action. This includes going regularly to the doctor and taking medications as prescribed. Additional information can be found at www.MyGlaucoma.com.  ""Growing up, I had challenges with my vision. I don't have glaucoma, but I know firsthand how it feels to deal with vision issues. Because of this, I'm dedicated to helping others who suffer from visual impairments and their caregivers,"" said . ""Working with , I learned that 27 percent of patients with glaucoma are estimated to go blind in one eye over a 10-year period, and I want to bring attention to the misunderstandings and impact of glaucoma so people and their loved ones can have more informed conversations with their doctors.""  As a child, Miller suffered from vision problems. This made school a challenge for him and he struggled to maintain a positive self-image because of it. Miller finally took control of his vision after a visit to his eye doctor and gained back his confidence that led him to go on to play professional football. Because of this, and knowing firsthand the feeling of losing your sight to any degree, Miller is passionate about helping others take control of their visual impairments and is excited about the opportunity to spotlight the misunderstandings and impact of living with glaucoma by joining 'My Glaucoma' campaign.  ""Following results from a survey of patients with glaucoma, which showed that there are many misperceptions about the disease, we launched the 'My Glaucoma' program in 2019 to amplify and highlight the seriousness of the disease, and encourage people on the frontlines and their caregivers to have meaningful conversations with their doctors,"" said , Vice President, Allergan Interventional Glaucoma.

The video, quiz and other resources for patients living with glaucoma and their caregivers are now live on www.MyGlaucoma.com.  About the 'My Glaucoma' Campaign   The 'My Glaucoma' campaign is designed to help people understand the burden of living with glaucoma and empower those with the disease and their caregivers to feel comfortable speaking with their doctor about a treatment regimen that fits their lifestyle. The resources available on are supported by a new survey of patients living with glaucoma and eye doctors, conducted in collaboration with Glaucoma Research Foundation (GRF), that found more than 75 percent of patients worry about vision loss because of the disease, but nearly half consider glaucoma to be only somewhat or not serious. In fact, research published by the suggests that 27 percent of patients with glaucoma are estimated to go blind in one eye over a 10-year period.  As a leader in eye care, Allergan sought to listen to the voices of patients with glaucoma and eye care professionals to put together meaningful resources that everyone living with glaucoma can benefit from. The interactive website offers access to videos that include perspectives from patients living with glaucoma and their caregivers, more information from the survey and patient resources, such as a conversation guide and facts about glaucoma diagnosis and treatment.  About Glaucoma   Glaucoma is one of the primary causes of irreversible vision loss and blindness. An estimated 70 million people globally are living with glaucoma. This progressive disease is characterized by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Uncontrolled, elevated IOP causes damage to the optic nerve and loss of vision. Reduction of elevated IOP is the only proven way to slow the progression of vision loss associated with glaucoma.  Current treatments to lower IOP include topical medications (eye drops), laser trabeculoplasty, minimally invasive glaucoma surgery and incisional surgery. Eye drop medications are the standard first-line treatment for open-angle glaucoma, the most common form, but low patient adherence to these medications is common – up to 80 percent of patients are not using topical medications as prescribed. Poor adherence to glaucoma medication could result in disease progression and vision loss. According to a study published by the , up to 59 percent of patients on treatment for glaucoma continue to progress, meaning they experience vision loss and damage to the optic nerve.

"Dec 23, 2019",Allergan Receives U.S. FDA Approval for UBRELVY™ for the Acute Treatment of Migraine with or without Aura in Adults,", /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE: AGN) today announced that the ( ) has approved a New Drug Application (NDA) for UBRELVY™ (ubrogepant) for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. UBRELVY™ is the first and only orally-administered calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist (gepant) for the treatment of migraine attacks once they start. Migraine is a neurological disease characterized by intermittent migraine attacks with symptoms that are often incapacitating. Migraine afflicts 31 million Americans and is the third most common disease and second leading cause of disability worldwide.  ""The approval of UBRELVY™, a new oral option that is effective in the acute treatment of migraine attacks, is a much-welcomed development for me and for many who care for patients. I can offer my migraine patients a new treatment option that may work for them,"" said Dr. , Neurologist and Professor at King's College, , and , and a paid consultant for . ""Perhaps even better, I am able to offer a new sense of hope for my patients who struggle for relief from this highly disabling problem.""  In clinical trials supporting the approval, UBRELVY™ provided quick pain relief for the majority of migraine patients. UBRELVY™ also met co-primary endpoints of freedom from pain and freedom from the most bothersome symptom (nausea, hypersensitivity to light, or hypersensitivity to sound), a recent, more stringent standard of efficacy the set in 2018. UBRELVY™ provided lasting relief up to 24 hours as well. UBRELVY™ works in a new way by blocking CGRP, a protein that is released during a migraine attack, from binding to its receptors. It works without constricting blood vessels, which some older treatments are known to do. UBRELVY™ is non-narcotic, not scheduled, and does not have addiction potential. It has been approved with two dose strengths, 50 mg and 100 mg, and is specially designed so healthcare providers can provide a personalized treatment approach for appropriate patients.  ""As someone living with migraine for 14 years, my life seems to be on pause when I experience a migraine attack,"" said , UBRELVY™ clinical trial patient. ""During the clinical trial, my experience with UBRELVY™ was positive. It relieved the migraine symptoms that bothered me the most without serious side effects. We have needed this type of on-demand oral relief for a very long time, and I look forward to having the ability to better manage my migraine attacks.""  ""We are extremely pleased that UBRELVY™ is now approved by the . As the first oral gepant, UBRELVY™ offers a new and different type of acute treatment option for people living with the debilitating pain and other symptoms of migraine,"" said , EVP and Chief R&D Officer, . ""Its oral administration with two dose strengths allows for treatment flexibility and relief when a migraine attack occurs. As we continue to drive innovation in migraine treatment, we are very proud to offer patients another option, and we are confident that it will make a difference for those in need. At , we believe that migraine patients deserve access to all new medications for this debilitating disease.""  About UBRELVY™ (ubrogepant)    UBRELVY™ (ubrogepant) is a novel, highly potent, orally-administered calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist (gepant) for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults that is an option for a wide range of patients who experience migraine attacks. It works in a new way by blocking CGRP, a protein released during a migraine attack, from binding to its receptors. It works without constricting blood vessels, which some older treatments are known to do. CGRP receptor antagonism is a completely new mechanism of action for the acute treatment of migraine.  The approval for UBRELVY™ is based on four clinical studies (ACHIEVE I, ACHIEVE II, UBR-MD-04 and 3110-105-002), which demonstrated efficacy, safety and tolerability of orally-administered UBRELVY™ in the acute treatment of migraine. The two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials (ACHIEVE I and ACHIEVE II) established the safety and efficacy profile of UBRELVY™. Both 50 mg and 100 mg dose strengths demonstrated significantly greater rates of pain freedom and freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours, compared with placebo.  Nausea was the most common adverse event reported in 1.7-4.1% of patients at various doses during the pivotal studies, compared to 1.6-2.0% of patients who received placebo. There were no serious adverse events within 48 hours of a dose. Additionally, the safety study (UBR-MD-04) reinforced the long-term safety and tolerability of UBRELVY™ for both the 50 mg and 100 mg dose strengths. Our research shows that UBRELVY™ was well tolerated with an adverse event profile similar to placebo.  UBRELVY™ will be available in the first quarter of 2020.  About Migraine    Migraine is a neurological disease with episodic attacks defined by symptoms such as headache pain, sensitivity to light and sound, and nausea. Migraine is highly prevalent, affecting approximately 31 million Americans, and is associated with significant disability leading to high personal, family, occupational, societal, and economic burden. There has long been a need for new treatments for migraine with improved benefit-risk profiles as compared to current standard of care.  UBRELVYTM (ubrogepant) is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. UBRELVY™ is not indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine.  Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions were nausea (4%) and somnolence (3%).  Please see link to full Prescribing Information.

You are at the highest risk if these problems are pre-existing before injection. Swallowing problems may last for several months • Spread of toxin effects. The effect of botulinum toxin may affect areas away from the injection site and cause serious symptoms including: loss of strength and all-over muscle weakness, double vision, blurred vision and drooping eyelids, hoarseness or change or loss of voice, trouble saying words clearly, loss of bladder control, trouble breathing, and trouble swallowing  There has not been a confirmed serious case of spread of toxin effect away from the injection site when BOTOX® has been used at the recommended dose to treat chronic migraine, severe underarm sweating, blepharospasm, strabismus, or when BOTOX® Cosmetic has been used at the recommended dose to treat frown lines, crow's feet lines, and/or forehead lines.  Indications    BOTOX® is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used: • To treat overactive bladder symptoms such as a strong need to urinate with leaking or wetting accidents, a strong need to urinate right away, and urinating often in adults 18 years and older when another type of medicine (anticholinergic) does not work well enough or cannot be taken • To treat leakage of urine (incontinence) in adults 18 years and older with overactive bladder caused by a neurologic disease who still have leakage or cannot tolerate the side effects after trying an anticholinergic medication • To prevent headaches in adults with chronic migraine who have 15 or more days each month with headache lasting 4 or more hours each day in people 18 years or older • To treat increased muscle stiffness in elbow, wrist, finger, thumb, ankle, and toe muscles in people 18 years and older with upper and lower limb spasticity • To treat increased muscle stiffness in children 2 to 17 years of age with upper limb spasticity • To treat increased muscle stiffness in children 2 to 17 years of age with lower limb spasticity, excluding spasticity caused by cerebral palsy • To treat the abnormal head position and neck pain that happens with cervical dystonia (CD) in people 16 years and older • To treat certain types of eye muscle problems (strabismus) or abnormal spasm of the eyelids (blepharospasm) in people 12 years and older  BOTOX® is also injected into the skin to treat the symptoms of severe underarm sweating (severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis) when medicines used on the skin (topical) do not work well enough in people 18 years and older.  BOTOX® Cosmetic is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used to temporarily improve the look of moderate to severe frown lines between the eyebrows, crow's feet lines, and forehead lines in adults.  It is not known whether BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic are safe or effective to prevent headaches in patients with migraine who have 14 or fewer headache days each month (episodic migraine).  It is not known whether BOTOX® is safe or effective to treat increased stiffness in upper limb muscles other than those in the elbow, wrist, fingers, and thumb, or in lower limb muscles other than those in the ankle and toes in people 18 years and older. BOTOX® has not been shown to help people perform task-specific functions with their upper limbs or increase movement in joints that are permanently fixed in position by stiff muscles.  It is not known whether BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic are safe or effective for other types of muscle spasms or for severe sweating anywhere other than your armpits.  It is not known if BOTOX® Cosmetic is safe or effective for use more than 1 time every 3 months.  BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic may cause loss of strength or general muscle weakness, vision problems, or dizziness within hours to weeks of taking BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic. If this happens, do not drive a car, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities.  Do not receive BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic if you: are allergic to any of its ingredients (see Medication Guide for ingredients); had an allergic reaction to any other botulinum toxin product such as Myobloc® (rimabotulinumtoxinB), Dysport® (abobotulinumtoxinA), or Xeomin® (incobotulinumtoxinA); have a skin infection at the planned injection site.  Do not receive BOTOX® for the treatment of urinary incontinence if you: have a urinary tract infection (UTI) or cannot empty your bladder on your own and are not routinely catheterizing. Due to the risk of urinary retention (not being able to empty the bladder), only patients who are willing and able to initiate catheterization post-treatment, if required, should be considered for treatment.  Patients treated for overactive bladder:    In clinical trials, 36 of the 552 patients had to self-catheterize for urinary retention following treatment with BOTOX® compared to 2 of the 542 treated with placebo. Patients with diabetes mellitus treated with BOTOX® were more likely to develop urinary retention than nondiabetics.  Patients treated for overactive bladder due to neurologic disease:    In clinical trials, 30.6% of patients (33/108) who were not using clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) prior to injection, required catheterization for urinary retention following treatment with BOTOX® 200 Units as compared to 6.7% of patients (7/104) treated with placebo. The median duration of post-injection catheterization for these patients treated with BOTOX® 200 Units (n = 33) was 289 days (minimum 1 day to maximum 530 days) as compared to a median duration of 358 days (minimum 2 days to maximum 379 days) for patients receiving placebo (n = 7). Among patients not using CIC at baseline, those with MS were more likely to require CIC post-injection than those with SCI.  The dose of BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic is not the same as, or comparable to, any other botulinum toxin product.  Serious and/or immediate allergic reactions have been reported, including itching, rash, red itchy welts, wheezing, asthma symptoms, or dizziness or feeling faint. Get medical help right away if you experience symptoms; further injection of BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic should be discontinued.  Tell your doctor about all your muscle or nerve conditions such as ALS or disease, myasthenia gravis, or Lambert-Eaton syndrome, as you may be at increased risk of serious side effects including difficulty swallowing and difficulty breathing from typical doses of BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic.  Tell your doctor if you have any breathing-related problems. Your doctor may monitor you for breathing problems during treatment with BOTOX® for adult spasticity or for detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition. The risk of developing lung disease in patients with reduced lung function is increased in patients receiving BOTOX®.  Cornea problems have been reported. Cornea (surface of the eye) problems have been reported in some people receiving BOTOX® for their blepharospasm, especially in people with certain nerve disorders. BOTOX® may cause the eyelids to blink less, which could lead to the surface of the eye being exposed to air more than is usual. Tell your doctor if you experience any problems with your eyes while receiving BOTOX®. Your doctor may treat your eyes with drops, ointments, contact lenses, or with an eye patch.  Bleeding behind the eye has been reported. Bleeding behind the eyeball has been reported in some people receiving BOTOX® for their strabismus. Tell your doctor if you notice any new visual problems while receiving BOTOX®.  Bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infections (common colds) have been reported. Bronchitis was reported more frequently in adults receiving BOTOX® for upper limb spasticity. Upper respiratory infections were also reported more frequently in adults with prior breathing related problems with spasticity. In pediatric patients treated with BOTOX® for upper limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infections were reported more frequently. In pediatric patients treated with BOTOX® for lower limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infection was not reported with an incidence greater than placebo.  Autonomic dysreflexia in patients treated for overactive bladder due to neurologic disease. Autonomic dysreflexia associated with intradetrusor injections of BOTOX® could occur in patients treated for detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition and may require prompt medical therapy. In clinical trials, the incidence of autonomic dysreflexia was greater in patients treated with BOTOX® 200 Units compared with placebo (1.5% versus 0.4%, respectively).  Tell your doctor about all your medical conditions, including if you: have or have had bleeding problems; have plans to have surgery; had surgery on your face; weakness of forehead muscles; trouble raising your eyebrows; drooping eyelids; any other abnormal facial change; have symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) and are being treated for urinary incontinence (symptoms of a urinary tract infection may include pain or burning with urination, frequent urination, or fever); have problems emptying your bladder on your own and are being treated for urinary incontinence; are pregnant or plan to become pregnant (it is not known if BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic can harm your unborn baby); are breastfeeding or plan to (it is not known if BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic passes into breast milk).  Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Using BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic with certain other medicines may cause serious side effects. Do not start any new medicines until you have told your doctor that you have received BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic in the past.  Tell your doctor if you have received any other botulinum toxin product in the last 4 months; have received injections of botulinum toxin such as Myobloc®, Dysport®, or Xeomin® in the past (tell your doctor exactly which product you received); have recently received an antibiotic injection; take muscle relaxants; take allergy or cold medicines; take sleep medicine; take aspirin-like products or blood thinners.  Other side effects of BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic include: dry mouth, discomfort or pain at injection site, tiredness, headache, neck pain, eye problems: double vision, blurred vision, decreased eyesight, drooping eyelids, swelling of your eyelids, dry eyes; drooping eyebrows; and upper respiratory tract infection.

"Dec 04, 2019",Allergan Announces Positive Phase 3 ACHIEVE I Trial Results for Ubrogepant Published in The New England Journal of Medicine,", /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE: AGN) today announced that positive results from ACHIEVE I (UBR-MD-01), a robust Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ubrogepant, have been published in the th issue of The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The data from this second published pivotal trial reinforced that the acute treatment of migraine with ubrogepant, compared with placebo, led to significantly greater rates of pain freedom and freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours with both the 50 mg and 100 mg doses. If -approved, ubrogepant would be the first available and approved small molecule, oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist (gepant) for the acute treatment of migraine.  ""The findings from the ACHIEVE I trial are particularly meaningful for primary care physicians who are first-line in migraine management and need treatment options that are safe and effective to treat debilitating migraine symptoms,"" said , MD, Family Practice Headache Specialist and Founder of Orange County Migraine & Headache Center and paid consultant for . ""With limited migraine-specific acute treatment options on the market, the approval of ubrogepant would provide healthcare providers and patients a much-needed new treatment option with a favorable side-effect profile that can be taken on-demand to effectively treat a migraine attack.""  The ACHIEVE I trial evaluated ubrogepant 50 mg and 100 mg, compared with placebo, across a wide range of endpoints, including more stringent guidelines established in 2018 for the acute treatment of migraine: meeting both co-primary endpoints of pain freedom (no pain at all) and freedom from the most bothersome of three non-headache migraine-associated symptoms (no sensitivity to light, no sensitivity to sound, or no nausea at all) at two hours post initial dose. For the two co-primary endpoints, ubrogepant 50 mg and 100 mg showed statistically significant higher response rates for pain freedom at two hours (11.8% for placebo, 19.2% for 50 mg, 21.2% for 100 mg) and freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours (27.8% for placebo, 38.6% for 50 mg, 37.7% for 100 mg).  ""Based on the recently published ACHIEVE I and ACHIEVE II data, I am confident that ubrogepant, with its novel mechanism of action as a gepant, will make a difference for people with migraine and unmet needs for acute treatment,"" said , M.D., Author of ACHIEVE I and Lead Author of ACHIEVE II, Professor and Vice Chair of Neurology at the and , Director of the Montefiore Headache Center. ""The favorable safety and tolerability profile, as well as the efficacy data, for ubrogepant are particularly important as we consider new treatment options for people living with migraine."" Dr. Lipton is also a paid consultant for , the trial sponsor.  Both doses of ubrogepant at 50 mg and 100 mg demonstrated significant improvement compared with placebo for a secondary efficacy endpoint of pain relief at two hours (49.1% for placebo, 60.7% for 50 mg, 61.4% for 100 mg). Pain relief was defined as the reduction in headache severity from moderate to severe pain to mild or no pain at two hours after initial doses. This secondary endpoint is most similar to the primary endpoint that older migraine treatments like triptans demonstrated for approval. Additionally, both doses of ubrogepant were statistically superior to placebo in sustained pain relief from two to 24 hours (20.8% for placebo, 36.3% for 50 mg, 38.0% for 100 mg).  Both the 50 mg and 100 mg doses of ubrogepant were well tolerated with an adverse event profile similar to placebo. There were no serious adverse events. Nausea was the most common adverse event, reported at 1.6% for placebo, 1.7% for 50 mg, 4.1% for 100 mg. Rates of all treatment-emergent adverse events were also similar to placebo (12.8% in placebo, 9.4% for 50 mg, 16.3% in 100mg).  ""I have been living with migraine attacks for more than 20 years, but unfortunately I do not have any tolerable prescription treatment options to take when I start having pain,"" said , migraine patient. ""I am hopeful for new treatment options that will eliminate my debilitating pain along with other migraine symptoms.""  Triptans are by far the most commonly used prescription medications for migraine, representing 73% of prescriptions within the acute treatment market. However, for people living with migraine, 67% report delaying or avoiding taking their prescription medication when a migraine attack occurs, often because of the adverse events they experience from the treatment. In addition, approximately 20% people with migraine have cardiovascular (CV) disease, and because triptans constrict blood vessels, they may be contraindicated in this patient population. For those who take triptans, as many as 30% may not sufficiently respond or may experience side effects.  ""We are pleased to see the results from our pivotal Phase 3 trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine ,"" said , M.D., VP, Chief Medical Officer, Central Nervous System. ""With the ACHIEVE II trial results recently published in The Journal of the , the recognition from these two prestigious medical journals underscores the significance of ubrogepant as a promising oral option for the acute treatment of migraine. We are proud of the research and science that have brought us to this point and look forward to continuing innovation in the pursuit of migraine freedom.""  The full NEJM article is available at http://bit.ly/2qWuI4R  About ACHIEVE I (UBR-MD-01) Study   The ACHIEVE I trial is a Phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ubrogepant (50 mg and 100 mg) compared to placebo for the acute treatment of a single migraine attack of moderate or severe headache pain intensity. In this pivotal trial, 1,672 adult participants (18-75 years of age) with a history of migraine (with or without aura) were randomized (1:1:1) to placebo, ubrogepant 50 mg, or ubrogepant 100 mg. The co-primary efficacy parameters were pain freedom (no pain) at two hours after the initial dose and freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours after the initial dose. The most bothersome migraine-associated symptom could include photophobia, phonophobia, or nausea and was selected by the participant immediately prior to treating a qualifying migraine attack. Secondary efficacy endpoints also evaluated the clinical benefits of ubrogepant across a wide range of outcome measures, including pain relief at two hours, sustained pain relief from 2 to 24 hours, and sustained pain freedom from 2 to 24 hours, among others. Adverse events were collected and evaluated for 48 hours after the initial and optional second dose of trial treatment, as well as within 30 days after administration of any dose.  About ACHIEVE I (UBR-MD-01) and ACHIEVE II (UBR-MD-02)   ACHIEVE I and ACHIEVE II both tested the efficacy of ubrogepant to treat a single migraine attack. The protocols for the two trials were identical except for the doses of ubrogepant tested. ACHIEVE I tested doses of 50 mg and 100 mg versus placebo, whereas ACHIEVE II tested doses of 25 mg and 50 mg versus placebo.  About Ubrogepant   Ubrogepant is a novel, highly potent, orally-administered CGRP receptor antagonist (gepant), in development for the acute treatment of migraine. CGRP and its receptors are expressed in regions of the nervous system associated with migraine pathophysiology. CGRP receptor antagonism is a completely new mechanism of action for the acute treatment of migraine compared to medications currently available, which include triptans (serotonin 1B/1D receptor agonists), opioids, ergots as well as over-the-counter medications, such ibuprofen and acetaminophen.  About Migraine    Migraine is a chronic disease with episodic attacks defined by neurological symptoms such as headache pain, sensitivity to light and sound, and nausea. Migraine is highly prevalent, affecting approximately 31 million Americans, and is associated with significant disability leading to high personal, family, occupational, societal, and economic burden. Based on the current standard of care, there are still unmet needs for new acute treatments for migraine.  , a leader in the migraine space, markets BOTOX® (onabotulinumtoxinA), the first -approved, preventive treatment for adult Chronic Migraine (approved 2010). is also advancing its migraine program with two investigational small molecule oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists (gepants), one of which is being developed for the acute treatment of migraine and one for the prevention of migraine. In addition to ubrogepant, which is expected to be the first -approved gepant with a completely new approach for acute treatment of migraine, atogepant is currently in Phase 3 development for the prevention of migraine.

"Nov 19, 2019",Allergan Announces Positive Phase 3 ACHIEVE II Trial Results for Ubrogepant Published in The Journal of the American Medical Association,", /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE: AGN) today announced that positive results from ACHIEVE II (UBR-MD-02), a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ubrogepant, have been published in the th issue of The Journal of the (JAMA). These data reinforced that acute treatment of migraine with ubrogepant compared with placebo led to significantly greater rates of pain freedom at two hours with both the 50 mg and 25 mg doses, and freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours with the 50 mg dose. If approved, ubrogepant would potentially be the first -approved small molecule, oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist (gepant) for the acute treatment of migraine.  ""Migraine is the second leading cause of disability, and we need new acute treatments that are efficacious, safe, and tolerable,"" said , M.D., Lead Author, Professor and Vice Chair of Neurology at the and , Director of the Montefiore Headache Center. ""Having ubrogepant as a potential new medication for the acute treatment of migraine will provide much-needed innovation for a disease that causes lost time for millions of people."" Dr. Lipton is also a paid consultant for , the trial sponsor.  The ACHIEVE II trial evaluated ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg, compared with placebo, across a wide range of clinical endpoints, including the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom (no pain) and freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours post-initial dose. For the two co-primary endpoints, ubrogepant 50 mg and 25 mg showed statistically significant higher response rates for pain freedom at two hours (21.8% for 50 mg, 20.7% for 25 mg and 14.3% for placebo), and the 50 mg dose demonstrated statistically significant higher response rates for the freedom from the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at two hours (38.9% for 50 mg and 27.4% for placebo). Additionally, ubrogepant 50 mg was statistically superior to placebo in the absence of light sensitivity (43.8% for 50 mg and 35.5% for placebo) and sound sensitivity (54.1% for 50 mg and 46.3% for placebo).  Ubrogepant studies show that both the 50 mg and 25 mg doses were well tolerated with an adverse event profile similar to placebo. The most common adverse reaction during the single attack studies (occurring with an incidence greater than 2 percent and at least twice the rate of placebo) was nausea (incidence 2-4%). In a year-long extension study, the most common treatment-related adverse event was also nausea, with an incidence <2 percent.  ""I have been living with migraine attacks for most of my life, but unfortunately, I can't tolerate existing prescription treatments when I start having pain,"" said , migraine patient. ""We really need new treatments, which is why I am so excited to see new research published in a prestigious medical journal about a medication that may provide what patients need.""  Triptans are the most popular acute treatment for migraine representing 70 percent of prescriptions. However, for people living with migraine disease, approximately 20 percent of individuals have multiple cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, and because triptans restrict blood vessels, they may not be appropriate for these migraine patients. And for those who take triptans, as many as 30 percent may not sufficiently respond or may experience side effects. In the ACHIEVE II trial, approximately 11 percent of participants had moderate to severe CV risk factors, and 23 percent of participants previously had an insufficient response to triptans.  ""If approved, ubrogepant will provide a new and different acute treatment option for patients suffering the debilitating pain and other symptoms of migraine. has a long history of developing migraine medications and remains committed to continued innovation of new treatments,"" said , M.D., VP, Chief Medical Officer, Central Nervous System at . ""Ubrogepant is a completely new approach to the acute treatment of migraine.

When I'm not running around the house trying to be super mom or staring at my computer editing my next book, I try to find time to simply focus on myself,"" explains Mollen. ""Sometimes, this means breaking away every few months to see my dermatologist for my next BOTOX® Cosmetic treatment. This way I can continue to look like myself, just with fewer lines.""  BOTOX® Cosmetic is the only neurotoxin approved for three treatment areas in adult patients.4 It is the brand that created a new category in facial aesthetics, since its first approval for cosmetic use in 2002.5 What many consumers don't know is that prior to the approval for aesthetic use in adults, BOTOX® was initially approved in 1989 for two rare eye disorders, blepharospasm and strabismus.6 BOTOX® was also recently approved for treatment of pediatric patients (2 to 17 years of age) with upper limb spasticity and lower limb spasticity, excluding spasticity caused by cerebral palsy.7  BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic have product attributes that are distinct, and combined, have more indications worldwide than any other neurotoxin.4,7 BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic have 14 approved indications,4,7 and over 100 million vials of BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic have been distributed worldwide.8  Recognized by National Day Archives as an official holiday on the National Day Registry™, BOTOX® Cosmetic Day will be held annually on the third Wednesday in November.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION    BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic may cause serious side effects that can be life threatening. Get medical help right away if you have any of these problems any time (hours to weeks) after injection of BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic: • Problems swallowing, speaking, or breathing, due to weakening of associated muscles, can be severe and result in loss of life. You are at the highest risk if these problems are pre-existing before injection. Swallowing problems may last for several months • Spread of toxin effects. The effect of botulinum toxin may affect areas away from the injection site and cause serious symptoms including: loss of strength and all-over muscle weakness, double vision, blurred vision and drooping eyelids, hoarseness or change or loss of voice, trouble saying words clearly, loss of bladder control, trouble breathing, and trouble swallowing  There has not been a confirmed serious case of spread of toxin effect away from the injection site when BOTOX® has been used at the recommended dose to treat chronic migraine, severe underarm sweating, blepharospasm, strabismus, or when BOTOX® Cosmetic has been used at the recommended dose to treat frown lines, crow's feet lines, and/or forehead lines.  Indications    BOTOX® is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used: • To treat overactive bladder symptoms such as a strong need to urinate with leaking or wetting accidents, a strong need to urinate right away, and urinating often in adults 18 years and older when another type of medicine (anticholinergic) does not work well enough or cannot be taken • To treat leakage of urine (incontinence) in adults 18 years and older with overactive bladder caused by a neurologic disease who still have leakage or cannot tolerate the side effects after trying an anticholinergic medication • To prevent headaches in adults with chronic migraine who have 15 or more days each month with headache lasting 4 or more hours each day in people 18 years or older • To treat increased muscle stiffness in elbow, wrist, finger, thumb, ankle, and toe muscles in people 18 years and older with upper and lower limb spasticity • To treat increased muscle stiffness in children 2 to 17 years of age with upper limb spasticity • To treat increased muscle stiffness in children 2 to 17 years of age with lower limb spasticity, excluding spasticity caused by cerebral palsy • To treat the abnormal head position and neck pain that happens with cervical dystonia (CD) in people 16 years and older • To treat certain types of eye muscle problems (strabismus) or abnormal spasm of the eyelids (blepharospasm) in people 12 years and older  BOTOX® is also injected into the skin to treat the symptoms of severe underarm sweating (severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis) when medicines used on the skin (topical) do not work well enough in people 18 years and older.  BOTOX® Cosmetic is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used to temporarily improve the look of moderate to severe frown lines between the eyebrows, crow's feet lines, and forehead lines in adults.  It is not known whether BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic are safe or effective to prevent headaches in patients with migraine who have 14 or fewer headache days each month (episodic migraine).  It is not known whether BOTOX® is safe or effective to treat increased stiffness in upper limb muscles other than those in the elbow, wrist, fingers, and thumb, or in lower limb muscles other than those in the ankle and toes in people 18 years and older. BOTOX® has not been shown to help people perform task-specific functions with their upper limbs or increase movement in joints that are permanently fixed in position by stiff muscles.  It is not known whether BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic are safe or effective for other types of muscle spasms or for severe sweating anywhere other than your armpits.  It is not known if BOTOX® Cosmetic is safe or effective for use more than 1 time every 3 months.  IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION (continued)    BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic may cause loss of strength or general muscle weakness, vision problems, or dizziness within hours to weeks of taking BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic. If this happens, do not drive a car, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities.  Do not receive BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic if you: are allergic to any of its ingredients (see Medication Guide for ingredients); had an allergic reaction to any other botulinum toxin product such as Myobloc® (rimabotulinumtoxinB), Dysport® (abobotulinumtoxinA), or Xeomin® (incobotulinumtoxinA); have a skin infection at the planned injection site.  Do not receive BOTOX® for the treatment of urinary incontinence if you: have a urinary tract infection (UTI) or cannot empty your bladder on your own and are not routinely catheterizing. Due to the risk of urinary retention (not being able to empty the bladder), only patients who are willing and able to initiate catheterization post-treatment, if required, should be considered for treatment.  Patients treated for overactive bladder:    In clinical trials, 36 of the 552 patients had to self-catheterize for urinary retention following treatment with BOTOX® compared to 2 of the 542 treated with placebo. Patients with diabetes mellitus treated with BOTOX® were more likely to develop urinary retention than nondiabetics.  Patients treated for overactive bladder due to neurologic disease:    In clinical trials, 30.6% of patients (33/108) who were not using clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) prior to injection, required catheterization for urinary retention following treatment with BOTOX® 200 Units as compared to 6.7% of patients (7/104) treated with placebo. The median duration of post-injection catheterization for these patients treated with BOTOX® 200 Units (n = 33) was 289 days (minimum 1 day to maximum 530 days) as compared to a median duration of 358 days (minimum 2 days to maximum 379 days) for patients receiving placebo (n = 7). Among patients not using CIC at baseline, those with MS were more likely to require CIC post-injection than those with SCI.  The dose of BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic is not the same as, or comparable to, any other botulinum toxin product.  Serious and/or immediate allergic reactions have been reported, including itching, rash, red itchy welts, wheezing, asthma symptoms, or dizziness or feeling faint. Get medical help right away if you experience symptoms; further injection of BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic should be discontinued.  Tell your doctor about all your muscle or nerve conditions such as ALS or disease, myasthenia gravis, or Lambert-Eaton syndrome, as you may be at increased risk of serious side effects including difficulty swallowing and difficulty breathing from typical doses of BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic.  Tell your doctor if you have any breathing-related problems. Your doctor may monitor you for breathing problems during treatment with BOTOX® for adult spasticity or for detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition. The risk of developing lung disease in patients with reduced lung function is increased in patients receiving BOTOX®.  Cornea problems have been reported. Cornea (surface of the eye) problems have been reported in some people receiving BOTOX® for their blepharospasm, especially in people with certain nerve disorders. BOTOX® may cause the eyelids to blink less, which could lead to the surface of the eye being exposed to air more than is usual. Tell your doctor if you experience any problems with your eyes while receiving BOTOX®. Your doctor may treat your eyes with drops, ointments, contact lenses, or with an eye patch.  Bleeding behind the eye has been reported. Bleeding behind the eyeball has been reported in some people receiving BOTOX® for their strabismus. Tell your doctor if you notice any new visual problems while receiving BOTOX®.  Bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infections (common colds) have been reported. Bronchitis was reported more frequently in adults receiving BOTOX® for upper limb spasticity. Upper respiratory infections were also reported more frequently in adults with prior breathing related problems with spasticity. In pediatric patients treated with BOTOX® for upper limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infections were reported more frequently. In pediatric patients treated with BOTOX® for lower limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infection was not reported with an incidence greater than placebo.  Autonomic dysreflexia in patients treated for overactive bladder due to neurologic disease. Autonomic dysreflexia associated with intradetrusor injections of BOTOX® could occur in patients treated for detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition and may require prompt medical therapy. In clinical trials, the incidence of autonomic dysreflexia was greater in patients treated with BOTOX® 200 Units compared with placebo (1.5% versus 0.4%, respectively).  Tell your doctor about all your medical conditions, including if you: have or have had bleeding problems; have plans to have surgery; had surgery on your face; weakness of forehead muscles; trouble raising your eyebrows; drooping eyelids; any other abnormal facial change; have symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) and are being treated for urinary incontinence (symptoms of a urinary tract infection may include pain or burning with urination, frequent urination, or fever); have problems emptying your bladder on your own and are being treated for urinary incontinence; are pregnant or plan to become pregnant (it is not known if BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic can harm your unborn baby); are breastfeeding or plan to (it is not known if BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic passes into breast milk).  Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Using BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic with certain other medicines may cause serious side effects. Do not start any new medicines until you have told your doctor that you have received BOTOX® or BOTOX® Cosmetic in the past.  Tell your doctor if you have received any other botulinum toxin product in the last 4 months; have received injections of botulinum toxin such as Myobloc®, Dysport®, or Xeomin® in the past (tell your doctor exactly which product you received); have recently received an antibiotic injection; take muscle relaxants; take allergy or cold medicines; take sleep medicine; take aspirin-like products or blood thinners.  Other side effects of BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic include: dry mouth, discomfort or pain at injection site, tiredness, headache, neck pain, eye problems: double vision, blurred vision, decreased eyesight, drooping eyelids, swelling of your eyelids, dry eyes; drooping eyebrows; and upper respiratory tract infection. In people being treated for urinary incontinence other side effects include: urinary tract infection, painful urination, and/or inability to empty your bladder on your own. If you have difficulty fully emptying your bladder after receiving BOTOX®, you may need to use disposable self-catheters to empty your bladder up to a few times each day until your bladder is able to start emptying again.

"Nov 11, 2019",Allergan Receives FDA Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) Designation And Fast Track Designation For ATM-AVI (Aztreonam And Avibactam) For Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negative Infections,", /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE: AGN) today announced the ( ) has granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) Designation and Fast Track Designation for ATM-AVI (aztreonam and avibactam), for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI), complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), and hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP)/ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP). ATM-AVI is an investigational, fixed-dose, intravenous combination antibiotic under development globally.  ""The rate of antibiotic resistance is increasing worldwide and there are limited options available to patients with these challenging and life-threatening infections, underscoring the need for the pharmaceutical industry and government to work together to bring forward new potential treatment options,"" said , EVP and Chief R&D Officer, . ""The QIDP Designation shows the importance of ATM-AVI for treating serious or life-threatening infections, and the Fast Track Designation allows us to work even closer with the to bring patients a new treatment faster.""  The QIDP designation provides certain incentives for the development of new antibiotics, including priority review and eligibility for the Fast Track Designation, and a five-year regulatory exclusivity extension. The Fast Track Designation is designed to facilitate the development, and accelerate the review of drugs to treat serious conditions that do not have sufficient treatment options.  ATM-AVI has activity against metallo ?-lactamase (MBL)-producing Gram-negative pathogens, for which there are currently very limited treatmentoptions. Although aztreonam is not inactivated by metallo beta-lactamases (MBLs), as a single agent it has limited utility because the vast majority of MBL-producing pathogens also express serine-?-lactamases that can inactivate it. When combined with avibactam's ability to inhibit many serine-?-lactamases , aztreonam's activity is restored against pathogens that co-produce MBLs and serine enzymes, thus presenting a new treatment for patients with these infections. ATM-AVI is currently in Phase III trials.  ATM-AVI is being jointly developed with Pfizer. holds the rights to commercialize ATM-AVI in , while Pfizer holds the rights to commercialize this investigational therapy in the rest of the world.  ATM-AVI is a drug candidate under development and supported by public-private partnerships between Pfizer and the (BARDA)*, and between Pfizer and the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) – a partnership between the and the European pharmaceutical industry, under a project called COMBACTE-CARE (Combating Bacterial Resistance in – Carbapenem Resistance)**. anti-infective portfolio also includes AVYCAZ ® (ceftazidime and avibactam), TEFLARO ® (ceftaroline fosamil), DALVANCE ® (dalbavancin) and MONUROL ® (fosfomycin tromethamine).

"Oct 24, 2019","FDA Approves BOTOX® (onabotulinumtoxinA) for Pediatric Patients with Lower Limb Spasticity, Excluding Spasticity Caused by Cerebral Palsy",", /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE: AGN) today announced that the ( ) approved the company's supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for BOTOX® for the treatment of pediatric patients (2 to 17 years of age) with lower limb spasticity, excluding spasticity caused by cerebral palsy (CP). This marks the 11th BOTOX® therapeutic indication, having been approved for pediatric upper limb spasticity (ULS) earlier this year. Spasticity is a debilitating neurological condition involving muscle stiffness that can result in tight muscles in the upper and lower limbs, and can interfere with movement. The severity can range from mild to severe muscle stiffness.  ""Lower limb spasticity can impact many aspects of a child's life and have a drastic influence on their overall development and quality of life,"" said , and Development Officer, . ""This milestone will continue to support and advance care for children and their caregivers who may be struggling with lower limb spasticity. Here at , we look forward to continuing to highlight our unwavering attention to innovation and build on our 30-years of research and development efforts with BOTOX®® since approval of blepharospasm and strabismus in 1989.""  The approval is based on a Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of BOTOX® in more than 300 pediatric patients aged two to 17 years old being treated for lower limb spasticity. While trial participants had cerebral palsy, the approved indication excludes lower limb spasticity caused by cerebral palsy due to marketing exclusivity by another company. These trials included a 12-week, double-blind study and a one-year open-label extension study.  The approved recommended dose per treatment session is 4 Units per kilogram to 8 Units per kilogram divided among affected muscles of the lower limb. The total dose per treatment session in the lower limb should not exceed 8 Units per kilogram or 300 Units, whichever is lower. When treating both lower limbs or upper and lower limbs in combination, the total dose in pediatric patients should not exceed 10 Units per kilogram body weight or 340 Units, whichever is lower, in a 3-month interval.  ""Pediatric lower limb spasticity inhibits normal muscular movement and function and can result in delayed or impaired motor development, as well as difficulty with posture and positioning,"" said M.D., Pediatric Rehabilitation Medicine Specialist, Gillette Children's Specialty Healthcare-St. Paul. ""BOTOX® has a well-established safety and efficacy profile, and supports children and adolescents successfully manage both their upper and lower limb spasticity.""  is committed to providing resources and services, such as the BOTOX® Savings Program, to help ensure BOTOX® is accessible and affordable to patients.  BOTOX® is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used: • to treat increased muscle stiffness in children 2 to 17 years of age with upper limb spasticity • to treat increased muscle stiffness in children 2 to 17 years of age with lower limb spasticity, excluding spasticity caused by cerebral palsy • to treat certain types of eye muscle problems (strabismus) or abnormal spasm of the eyelids (blepharospasm) in people 12 years and older  It is not known whether BOTOX® is safe or effective for other types of muscle spasms.  IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION   BOTOX® may cause serious side effects that can be life threatening. Get medical help right away if you have any of these problems any time (hours to weeks) after injection of BOTOX®: • Problems swallowing, speaking, or breathing, due to weakening of associated muscles, can be severe and result in loss of life. You are at the highest risk if these problems are pre-existing before injection. Swallowing problems may last for several months. • Spread of toxin effects. The effect of botulinum toxin may affect areas away from the injection site and cause serious symptoms including: loss of strength and all-over muscle weakness, double vision, blurred vision and drooping eyelids, hoarseness or change or loss of voice, trouble saying words clearly, loss of bladder control, trouble breathing, and trouble swallowing.  There has not been a confirmed serious case of spread of toxin effect away from the injection site when BOTOX® has been used at the recommended dose to treat blepharospasm or strabismus.  BOTOX® may cause loss of strength or general muscle weakness, vision problems, or dizziness within hours to weeks of taking BOTOX®. If this happens, do not drive a car, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities.  Do not receive BOTOX® if you: are allergic to any of the ingredients in BOTOX® (see Medication Guide for ingredients); had an allergic reaction to any other botulinum toxin product such as Myobloc® (rimabotulinumtoxinB), Dysport® (abobotulinumtoxinA), or Xeomin® (incobotulinumtoxinA); have a skin infection at the planned injection site.  The dose of BOTOX® is not the same as, or comparable to, another botulinum toxin product.  Serious and/or immediate allergic reactions have been reported including itching, rash, red itchy welts, wheezing, asthma symptoms, or dizziness or feeling faint. Get medical help right away if you experience symptoms; further injection of BOTOX® should be discontinued.  Tell your doctor about all your muscle or nerve conditions such as ALS or disease, myasthenia gravis, or Lambert-Eaton syndrome, as you may be at increased risk of serious side effects including difficulty swallowing and difficulty breathing from typical doses of BOTOX®.  Cornea problems have been reported. Cornea (surface of the eye) problems have been reported in some people receiving BOTOX® for their blepharospasm, especially in people with certain nerve disorders. BOTOX® may cause the eyelids to blink less, which could lead to the surface of the eye being exposed to air more than is usual. Tell your doctor if you experience any problems with your eyes while receiving BOTOX®. Your doctor may treat your eyes with drops, ointments, contact lenses, or with an eye patch.  Bleeding behind the eye has been reported. Bleeding behind the eyeball has been reported in some people receiving BOTOX® for their strabismus. Tell your doctor if you notice any new visual problems while receiving BOTOX®.  Upper respiratory tract infections (common colds) have been reported. In pediatric patients treated with BOTOX® for upper limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infections were reported more frequently.

"Oct 11, 2019",Allergan and Molecular Partners Present Late-Breaking Data from Phase 3 Studies of Investigational Abicipar pegol in Neovascular Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration,", /PRNewswire/ -- , (NYSE: AGN), a leading global pharmaceutical company with a more than 70-year heritage in ophthalmology and (SIX: MOLN), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of drugs known as DARPin® therapies, today announced two-year data from the CEDAR and SEQUOIA clinical studies of investigational Abicipar in patients with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). In the second year of these studies, four injections of Abicipar resulted in the maintenance of visual gains comparable to monthly ranibizumab. These data were presented as a late-breaking oral presentation during Retina Subspecialty Day at the Annual Meeting of the (AAO).  CEDAR and SEQUOIA are identical global Phase 3 studies designed to assess the efficacy and safety of Abicipar 8-week and 12-week treatment regimens compared with monthly ranibizumab in treatment-naïve patients with nAMD. previously announced that Abicipar met the prespecified primary end point of the proportion of patients with stable vision at week 52 demonstrating non-inferiority in both the 8-week and 12-week treatment regimens compared to monthly ranibizumab.  Through week 104, patients received Abicipar 2 mg every 8-weeks or every 12-weeks or ranibizumab 0.5 mg every 4 weeks. At week 104 in the pooled Phase 3 data, the proportion of patients with stable vision was 93%, 90% and 94% in 8-week Abicipar; 12-week Abicipar and 4-week ranibizumab treatment regimens, respectively. This continuation of stable vision in year 2 further reinforces the ability of Abicipar to deliver consistent quarterly dosing for the majority of patients.  ""Current anti-VEGF treatments for neovascular age-related macular degeneration require frequent intravitreal injections,"" said , M.D., . ""Based on the results of CEDAR and SEQUOIA, which reinforce the efficacy of Abicipar while decreasing the number of injections, Abicipar could transform anti-VEGF treatment regimens.""  Mean changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) seen in year two were similar when compared to year one across all treatment arms. Central retinal thickness (CRT) continued to decrease during year two when compared to year one. CRT for patients treated with Abicipar dosed quarterly and every 8-weeks were similar to ranibizumab dosed every 4 weeks through week 104. Overall incidence rates of treatment-emergent adverse events at the end of year two were comparable between treatment groups. The pooled rate of new cases of intraocular inflammation in year two for patients who received Abicipar in the 8-and 12-week arms was 1.9%, which is similar to the ranibizumab arm of 1%.  ""These late-breaking data further demonstrate the potential of Abicipar to provide consistent quarterly dosing that sustains vision gains in the majority of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration,"" said , and Development Officer, . ""On the heels of regulatory filings for Abicipar in the , these data give us confidence in our ability to meet a serious unmet need for patients and eye doctors.""

"Oct 10, 2019","On World Sight Day, Allergan Launches National Campaign to Raise Awareness of the Toll Glaucoma Takes on Everyday Living",", /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE: AGN), a leading global pharmaceutical company with more than 70 years of heritage in eye care, today announced a national education campaign called My Glaucoma. The campaign is designed to help people understand the burden of living with glaucoma and empower those with the disease and their caregivers to feel comfortable speaking with their doctor about a treatment regimen that fits their lifestyle. The resources available on are supported by a new survey of patients living with glaucoma and eye doctors, conducted in collaboration with (GRF), that found more than 75 percent of patients worry about vision loss because of the disease, but nearly half consider glaucoma to be only somewhat or not serious. In fact, research published by the suggests that 27 percent of patients with glaucoma are estimated to go blind in one eye over a 10-year period.  ""Glaucoma is clearly a national health issue and one that is overlooked in favor of other diseases perceived as more critical. Given the potential for vision loss, it is increasingly important that we highlight the seriousness of glaucoma, the emotional toll it takes on those living with the disease every day and the importance of doctor-patient communication,"" said , President and CEO, . ""As we mark this year's World Sight Day, we are proud to partner with to magnify this data for the general public and offer resources that help preserve people's sight.""  ""Our perception of glaucoma must change from one that characterizes the disease as 'part of getting old' to one that reinforces its severity and the importance of active treatment,"" said , Vice President, Allergan Interventional Glaucoma. ""Our interactive website and partnership with the eye care community and is a major step forward in ensuring patients and their caregivers feel comfortable and confident taking greater control of their glaucoma in the doctor's office and at home.""  As a leader in eye care, sought to listen to the voices of patients with glaucoma and eye care professionals to put together meaningful resources that everyone living with glaucoma can benefit from. The interactive website www.MyGlaucoma.com offers access to videos that include perspectives from patients living with glaucoma and their caregivers, more information from the survey and patient resources, such as a conversation guide and facts about glaucoma diagnosis and treatment.  ""More than 3 million Americans are estimated to be living with glaucoma. As such, it is vital patients keep an open-line of communication with their eye doctors about struggles they may be having with their glaucoma and treatment routine, as well as what they may be experiencing emotionally,"" said Sahar Bedrood, M.D., Ph.D., Glaucoma Specialist at and Assistant Professor of Ophthalmology. ""A patient should not hold back discussing their challenges, as every piece of information can be important to customize their care and lessen the burden of the disease.""  About the Survey   In an online survey commissioned by , in collaboration with , of 500 glaucoma patients and 100 eye doctors in , results showed that glaucoma takes a significant emotional toll on people with the disease, as 4 in 5 glaucoma patients admit that they worry about how their lifestyle will change as a result of the disease. Additionally, there is a need for a more proactive two-way dialogue between eye care doctors and patients, especially around treatment, as patients stated current treatment options cause disruption in their lives. Almost 9 in 10 eye doctors wish their patients would take their medication as prescribed. Specifically, 79 percent want their patients to tell them if they're struggling with it.  About Glaucoma   Glaucoma is one of the primary causes of irreversible vision loss and blindness. An estimated 70 million people globally are living with glaucoma. This progressive disease is characterized by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Uncontrolled, elevated IOP causes damage to the optic nerve and loss of vision. Reduction of elevated IOP is the only proven way to slow the progression of vision loss associated with glaucoma.  Current treatments to lower IOP include topical medications (eye drops), laser trabeculoplasty, minimally invasive glaucoma surgery and incisional surgery. Eye drop medications are the standard first-line treatment for open-angle glaucoma, the most common form, but low patient adherence to these medications is common – up to 80 percent of patients are not using topical medications as prescribed. Poor adherence to glaucoma medication could result in disease progression and vision loss. According to a study published by the , up to 59 percent of patients on treatment for glaucoma continue to progress, meaning they experience vision loss and damage to the optic nerve.  About Allergan Eye Care   As a leader in eye care, has discovered, developed, and delivered some of the most innovative products in the industry for more than 70 years. has launched over 125 eye care products and invested billions of dollars in new treatments for the most prevalent eye conditions including glaucoma, ocular surface disease, and retinal diseases such as diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion.

"Jul 17, 2019",U.S. FDA Accepts Allergan's New Drug Application for Bimatoprost Sustained-Release in Patients with Open-Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension,", /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE: AGN), a leading global pharmaceutical company with more than 70 years of heritage in eye care, today announced that the ( ) has accepted the company's New Drug Application (NDA) for Bimatoprost Sustained-Release (SR). Bimatoprost SR if approved would be the first-in-class sustained-release, biodegradable implant for the reduction of intraocular pressure in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The is expected to take action on the NDA by the end of the first half of 2020.  ""With decades of experience researching and introducing innovative eye care treatments, we understand the importance of developing new and potentially sight-saving treatments for patients with glaucoma,"" said , and Development Officer, . ""The NDA is based on the positive results from the ARTEMIS Phase 3 studies and demonstrates our ongoing commitment to providing new treatments for patients living with glaucoma.""  In the two Phase 3 ARTEMIS studies, Bimatoprost SR reduced intraocular pressure (IOP) by 30 percent over the 12-week primary efficacy period, meeting the predefined criteria for non-inferiority to the study comparator. The ARTEMIS studies evaluated 1,122 subjects on the efficacy and safety of Bimatoprost SR versus timolol, a standard comparator for registrational clinical trials, in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. After 3 treatments with Bimatoprost SR, greater than 80 percent of patients remained treatment free and did not need additional treatment to maintain IOP control for at least 12 months. Bimatoprost SR was well tolerated in the majority of patients.  ""Millions of people are living with glaucoma, a progressive disease that requires sustained IOP control to preserve vision for patients,"" said , M.D., Chairman & Distinguished Professor of Ophthalmology and Director of the , . ""Data from the ARTEMIS trials show Bimatoprost SR lowers IOP and maintains that effect for the majority of patients for one year after three administrations of the implant. Bimatoprost SR has the potential to be the first sustained-release option that could significantly shift the paradigm for treating glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness.""  Glaucoma is one of the primary causes of irreversible vision loss and blindness. In 2018, nearly 130 million people were living with glaucoma globally. This number is expected to rise to an estimated 148 million by 2023. This progressive disease is characterized by elevated IOP. Uncontrolled, elevated IOP causes damage to the optic nerve and loss of vision. Reduction of elevated IOP is the only proven way to slow the progression and vision loss associated with glaucoma.  Current treatments to lower IOP include topical medications (eye drops), laser trabeculoplasty, minimally invasive glaucoma surgery and incisional surgery. Eye drop medications are the standard first-line treatment for glaucoma, but low patient adherence to these medications is common – up to 80 percent of patients are not using topical medications as prescribed. Patients often find it difficult to adhere to their eye drop regimen every day, year after year, because they forget to take doses, cannot afford medications, do not understand their disease or have trouble instilling eye drops or sticking to the schedule. Poor adherence to topical medications relates directly to disease progression and vision loss. To remove long-term eye drop adherence as a factor in preserving vision, ophthalmologists rely on laser trabeculoplasty, minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) and more invasive incisional surgeries and await the development of sustained-release medication.  As a leader in eye care, has discovered, developed, and delivered some of the most innovative products in the industry over the last 70 years. has launched over 125 eye care products and invested billions of dollars in new treatments for the most prevalent eye conditions including glaucoma, ocular surface disease, and retinal diseases such as diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion.

About Ubrogepant    Ubrogepant is an orally-administered CGRP receptor antagonist in development for the acute treatment of migraine. CGRP and its receptors are expressed in regions of the nervous system associated with migraine pathophysiology. CGRP receptor antagonism is a novel mechanism of action for the acute treatment of migraine that differs from the mechanisms of currently available triptans (serotonin 1B/1D agonists), opioids and ergots.  About Atogepant   Atogepant is an orally-administered CGRP receptor antagonist in development for the prevention of migraine. CGRP and its receptors are expressed in regions of the nervous system associated with migraine pathophysiology. It is chemically distinct from ubrogepant, our investigational orally-administered CGRP receptor antagonist for the acute treatment of migraine, and has demonstrated in preclinical studies to have a higher potency and longer half-life, making it potentially suitable for preventive treatment.  About Migraine Disease   Migraine is a chronic disease with episodic attacks defined by neurological symptoms such as headache pain, sensitivity to light and sound, and nausea; these symptoms are often incapacitating. Migraine is highly prevalent, affecting approximately 1 in 7 individuals, and is associated with significant disability leading to high personal, family, societal, and economic burden. Despite its prevalence and the availability of treatments, migraine is an underdiagnosed and undertreated disease. There is a need for new treatments for migraine with improved benefit-risk profiles to fulfill this unmet need.  , a leader in the migraine space, markets BOTOX® (onabotulinumtoxinA) the first FDA-approved, preventive treatment for adult Chronic Migraine patients since it was approved in 2010. Allergan is also advancing its migraine program with two investigational small molecule oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists, which are being developed for the acute treatment and prevention of migraine. The U.S. has accepted the company's New Drug Application (NDA) for ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine in adults, and a PDUFA date is expected in the fourth quarter of 2019. Ubrogepant is expected to be the first oral CGRP receptor antagonist to market. In addition, atogepant is currently in Phase 3 development for the prevention of migraine.

Women who are close to menstruation may find that it comes sooner or cramping is increased or intensified with CoolTone treatments, therefore it is recommended to not undergo treatment during this time of the month.  Ensure that persons with pacemakers are not present in vicinity of the device during treatment.  The patient must not be left unattended during treatment.  Adverse effects may include, but are not limited to muscular pain, temporary muscle spasm, temporary joint or tendon pain, and local erythema or skin redness.  Consult the CoolTone User Manual for a complete list of Contraindications, Warnings, Precautions, and potential side effects. Treatment applications that deviate from the guidelines are not recommended.  CoolSculpting is a non-surgical, clinically proven treatment that selectively reduces unwanted fat using a patented cooling technology. Cleared by the , CoolSculpting works by gently cooling targeted fat cells in the body to induce a natural, controlled elimination of fat cells without affecting surrounding tissue, and the treated fat cells are gone for good. In 2019, CoolSculpting was recognized for the sixth consecutive year by NewBeauty as a Choice Award winner. Millions of CoolSculpting treatments have been performed in more than 80 countries. CoolSculpting is available through a network of CoolSculpting Centers worldwide. Dermatologists, plastic surgeons and aesthetic specialists that offer CoolSculpting can be found at www.coolsculpting.com.  The CoolSculpting procedure is -cleared for the treatment of visible fat bulges in the thigh, abdomen and flank, along with bra fat, back fat, underneath the buttocks (also known as banana roll), and upper arm in patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of ?30 and in submental and submandibular areas in patients with a BMI of ?46.2. It is also -cleared to affect the appearance of lax tissue with submental area treatments.  CoolSculpting is contraindicated in patients with cryoglobulinemia, cold agglutinin disease, or paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria.  Ask your patient about any medical conditions including recent surgery, pre-existing hernia, and any known sensitives or allergies.  During the procedure patients may experience sensations of pulling, tugging, mild pinching, intense cold, tingling, stinging, aching, and cramping at the treatment site. These sensations subside as the area becomes numb. Following the procedure, typical side effects include temporary redness, swelling, blanching, bruising, firmness, tingling, stinging, tenderness, cramping, aching, itching, or skin sensitivity, and sensation of fullness in the back of the throat after submental or submandibular area treatment.  Rare side effects may also occur. Paradoxical hyperplasia (visibly enlarged tissue volume in the treated area) may develop 2-5 months after treatment and requires surgical intervention for correction.  As with any medical procedure, a consultation should be done by a licensed healthcare professional to determine if the patient is a candidate for treatment.

"Jun 21, 2019",FDA Approves BOTOX® (onabotulinumtoxinA) for Pediatric Patients with Upper Limb Spasticity,", /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE: AGN) today announced that the ( ) approved the company's supplemental biologics application (sBLA) for BOTOX® for the treatment of pediatric patients (2 to 17 years of age) with upper limb spasticity. BOTOX® was granted a six-month Priority Review by the , which is typically granted to therapies that if approved, could offer significant improvements in safety and effectiveness when compared to current standard of care. The is also reviewing an additional sBLA for the use of BOTOX® to treat pediatric patients with lower limb spasticity, with a decision expected in the fourth quarter of this year.  Damage to the brain and spine can result in spasticity, which is often observed as muscle tightness and stiffness in the upper and lower limbs. Upper limb spasticity can interfere with movement at the joints of the upper limb and its severity can range from mild to severe muscle stiffness. Common causes of spasticity in children include cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and stroke, which is a group of disorders affecting one's ability to move and maintain balance and posture.  ""Watching a child suffering with any degree of upper limb spasticity is very difficult,"" said , and Development Officer, . ""This FDA approval is special to all of us at because we can now provide children and their caregivers an advancement in pediatric care with BOTOX®. This milestone underscores our constant focus on innovation and builds on our 30-years of research and development efforts with BOTOX® since approval of blepharospasm and strabismus in 1989. We also look forward to the decision on pediatric lower limb spasticity and continuing to serve our patients globally.""  The approval is based on data from two Phase 3 studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of BOTOX® in over 200 pediatric patients with upper limb spasticity. These trials included a 12-week, double-blind study and a one-year open-label extension study.  The approved recommended dose per treatment session is 3 Units per kilogram to 6 Units per kilogram divided among affected muscles of the upper limb. The total dose in pediatric patients should not exceed 8 Units per kilogram body weight or 300 Units, whichever is lower, in a 3-month interval. Treatment with BOTOX® is not meant to replace existing physical therapy or other rehabilitation that may have been prescribed.  ""Pediatric upper limb spasticity is a significant concern and can negatively impact a child's development and quality of life,"" said M.D., Pediatric Rehabilitation Medicine Specialist, Gillette Children's Specialty Healthcare-St. Paul. ""Because spasticity is particularly debilitating to growing children, it requires ongoing care. BOTOX® has a well-established safety and efficacy profile and I believe it will be an important treatment option in helping successfully manage upper limb spasticity in children and adolescents.""  is committed to providing resources and services, such as the BOTOX® Savings Program, to help ensure BOTOX® is accessible and affordable to patients. Over the past 30 years, more than 100 million vials of BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic (onabotulinumtoxinA) have been distributed worldwide. With more than 3,700 articles on BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic published in scientific and medical journals, BOTOX® neurotoxin is one of the most widely researched medicines in the world.  BOTOX® is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used: • to treat increased muscle stiffness in children 2 to 17 years of age with upper limb spasticity • to treat certain types of eye muscle problems (strabismus) or abnormal spasm of the eyelids (blepharospasm) in people 12 years and older  Treatment with BOTOX® in children 2 to 17 years of age with upper limb spasticity is not meant to replace existing physical therapy or other rehabilitation that may have been prescribed.  It is not known whether BOTOX® is safe or effective for other types of muscle spasms.  BOTOX® may cause serious side effects that can be life threatening. Get medical help right away if you have any of these problems any time (hours to weeks) after injection of BOTOX®: • Problems swallowing, speaking, or breathing, due to weakening of associated muscles, can be severe and result in loss of life. You are at the highest risk if these problems are pre-existing before injection. Swallowing problems may last for several months. • Spread of toxin effects. The effect of botulinum toxin may affect areas away from the injection site and cause serious symptoms including: loss of strength and all-over muscle weakness, double vision, blurred vision and drooping eyelids, hoarseness or change or loss of voice, trouble saying words clearly, loss of bladder control, trouble breathing, and trouble swallowing.  There has not been a confirmed serious case of spread of toxin effect away from the injection site when BOTOX® has been used at the recommended dose to treat blepharospasm or strabismus.  BOTOX® may cause loss of strength or general muscle weakness, vision problems, or dizziness within hours to weeks of taking BOTOX®. If this happens, do not drive a car, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities.  Do not receive BOTOX® if you: are allergic to any of the ingredients in BOTOX® (see Medication Guide for ingredients); had an allergic reaction to any other botulinum toxin product such as Myobloc® (rimabotulinumtoxinB), Dysport® (abobotulinumtoxinA), or Xeomin® (incobotulinumtoxinA); have a skin infection at the planned injection site.  The dose of BOTOX® is not the same as, or comparable to, another botulinum toxin product.  Serious and/or immediate allergic reactions have been reported including itching, rash, red itchy welts, wheezing, asthma symptoms, or dizziness or feeling faint. Get medical help right away if you experience symptoms; further injection of BOTOX® should be discontinued.  Tell your doctor about all your muscle or nerve conditions such as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, myasthenia gravis, or Lambert-Eaton syndrome, as you may be at increased risk of serious side effects including difficulty swallowing and difficulty breathing from typical doses of BOTOX®.  Cornea problems have been reported. Cornea (surface of the eye) problems have been reported in some people receiving BOTOX® for their blepharospasm, especially in people with certain nerve disorders. BOTOX® may cause the eyelids to blink less, which could lead to the surface of the eye being exposed to air more than is usual. Tell your doctor if you experience any problems with your eyes while receiving BOTOX®. Your doctor may treat your eyes with drops, ointments, contact lenses, or with an eye patch.  Bleeding behind the eye has been reported. Bleeding behind the eyeball has been reported in some people receiving BOTOX® for their strabismus. Tell your doctor if you notice any new visual problems while receiving BOTOX®.  Bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infections (common colds) have been reported. In pediatric patients treated with BOTOX® for upper limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infections were reported more frequently.  Tell your doctor about all your medical conditions, including if you: have or have had bleeding problems; have plans to have surgery; had surgery on your face; weakness of forehead muscles; trouble raising your eyebrows; drooping eyelids; any other abnormal facial change; are pregnant or plan to become pregnant (it is not known if BOTOX® can harm your unborn baby); are breastfeeding or plan to (it is not known if BOTOX® passes into breast milk).  Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Using BOTOX® with certain other medicines may cause serious side effects. Do not start any new medicines until you have told your doctor that you have received BOTOX® in the past.  Tell your doctor if you received any other botulinum toxin product in the last 4 months; have received injections of botulinum toxin such as Myobloc®, Dysport®, or Xeomin® in the past (tell your doctor exactly which product you received); have recently received an antibiotic by injection; take muscle relaxants; take an allergy or cold medicine; take a sleep medicine; take aspirin-like products or blood thinners.  Other side effects of BOTOX® include: dry mouth, discomfort or pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, neck pain, eye problems: double vision, blurred vision, decreased eyesight, drooping eyelids, swelling of your eyelids, dry eyes, drooping eyebrows; and upper respiratory tract infection.

"May 28, 2019",Allergan and Gedeon Richter Receive U.S. FDA Approval For Expanded Use of VRAYLAR® (cariprazine) in the Treatment of Bipolar Depression,"and , /PRNewswire/ -- plc (NYSE: AGN) and Gedeon Richter Plc. today announced that the ( ) has approved a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for VRAYLAR® (cariprazine) for expanded use to treat depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (bipolar depression) in adults. VRAYLAR is also approved in the U.S. to treat manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults. There are nearly 11 million adults in the U.S. living with bipolar disorder,1 a condition that causes extreme shifts in mood, energy, and activity levels.2  ""Treating bipolar disorder can be very difficult because people living with the illness experience a range of depressive and manic symptoms, sometimes both at the same time, and this approval gives healthcare providers a new option to treat the full spectrum of bipolar I disorder symptoms, specifically manic, mixed, and depressive episodes, with just one medication,"" said Dr. , Professor of Psychiatry at the and lead author of the post hoc analysis, Cariprazine Efficacy in Patients with Bipolar Depression and Concurrent Manic Symptoms. ""Treating depression, mania and mixed episodes with a single medication is important for people living with, and healthcare providers treating, this complex illness. This approval can streamline a treatment decision while helping to stabilize the disorder.""  Seventy percent of people living with bipolar disorder receive at least one misdiagnosis and consult an average of four doctors over approximately 10 years before being accurately diagnosed.3 Many patients take multiple medications to treat the symptoms of this condition.  The approval for the expanded indication of VRAYLAR is based on three pivotal trials, including RGH-MD-53, RGH-MD-54 and RGH-MD-56, in which cariprazine demonstrated greater improvement than placebo for the change from baseline to week six on the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating scale (MADRS) total score. In all three studies, the VRAYLAR 1.5 mg dose demonstrated statistical significance over placebo; additionally, in RGH-MD-54, the VRAYLAR 3 mg dose demonstrated statistical significance over placebo. Common adverse events reported in the pivotal trials were nausea, akathisia, restlessness, and extrapyramidal symptoms.  ""This approval represents an important milestone in our efforts to help patients and prescribing healthcare providers effectively manage bipolar I disorder and demonstrates our ongoing focus on mental health,"" said , at Allergan. ""We are committed to developing therapies for complex mental health disorders, including VRAYLAR, which is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of major depressive disorder.""  ""This approval is considered a notable achievement in the development process of cariprazine, our flagship product,"" said Dr. István Greiner, Research Director of . ""We are pleased that more and more patient groups suffering from psychiatric disorders will get access to cariprazine as a treatment option.""  About VRAYLAR® (cariprazine)  VRAYLAR is an oral, once daily atypical antipsychotic approved for the acute treatment of adults with manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (3 to 6 mg/day) and for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (bipolar depression) in adults (1.5 or 3 mg/day). VRAYLAR is also approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults (1.5 to 6 mg/day).  While the mechanism of action of VRAYLAR is unknown, the efficacy of VRAYLAR could be mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at central dopamine D? and serotonin 5-HT receptors and antagonist activity at serotonin 5-HT receptors. Pharmacodynamic studies with cariprazine have shown that it acts as a partial agonist with high binding affinity at dopamine D , dopamine D , and serotonin 5-HT receptors. Cariprazine demonstrated up to ~8-fold greater in vitro affinity for dopamine D vs D receptors. Cariprazine also acts as an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT and 5-HT receptors with high and moderate binding affinity, respectively as well as it binds to the histamine H receptors.  VRAYLAR shows lower binding affinity to the serotonin 5-HT and ? - adrenergic receptors and has no appreciable affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors. The clinical significance of these in vitro data is unknown.  VRAYLAR was discovered and co-developed by Gedeon Richter Plc and is licensed by Allergan, in the U.S. and Canada. For more than a decade both companies have conducted over 20 clinical trials enrolling thousands of patients worldwide to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cariprazine for people living with a broad range of mental health illnesses.  There are nearly 11 million adults in the U.S. living with bipolar disorder,1 a condition that causes periods of severe changes in mood, energy, and activity levels.2 These periods are often called ""episodes."" Experiencing just one manic episode is enough to be diagnosed with bipolar I disorder. Although there is no known cure, its symptoms may be managed.4  Bipolar depression refers to the depressive episodes of bipolar I disorder. People living with bipolar I disorder can have manic and depressive episodes, as well as mixed episodes that feature both manic and depressive symptoms at the same time. Depressive symptoms are three times more prevalent than manic symptoms and constitute a larger portion of the patient's life spent unwell.5 Bipolar I depression typically lasts at least two weeks and can be difficult to differentiate from major depression during diagnosis. If misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, people may be given an antidepressant which, when taken as a monotherapy by someone with bipolar disorder, can induce a manic episode.6  VRAYLAR is an oral, once daily atypical antipsychotic approved for the acute treatment of adults with manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (3 to 6 mg/day) and for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (bipolar depression) in adults (1.5 or 3 mg/day). VRAYLAR is also approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults (1.5 to 6 mg/day).  Contraindication: VRAYLAR is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity. Reactions have included rash, pruritus, urticaria, and events suggestive of angioedema.  Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke: In clinical trials with antipsychotic drugs, elderly subjects with dementia had a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions, including fatalities vs placebo. VRAYLAR is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.  Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): NMS, a potentially fatal symptom complex, has been reported with antipsychotic drugs. NMS may cause hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, delirium, and autonomic instability. Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. Manage with immediate discontinuation, intensive symptomatic treatment, and monitoring.  Tardive Dyskinesia (TD): Risk of developing TD (a syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements) and the likelihood it will become irreversible may increase with the duration of treatment and the cumulative dose. The syndrome can develop after a relatively brief treatment period, even at low doses, or after treatment discontinuation. If signs and symptoms of TD appear, drug discontinuation should be considered.  Late-Occurring Adverse Reactions: Adverse events may first appear several weeks after initiation of VRAYLAR, probably because plasma levels of cariprazine and its major metabolites accumulate over time. As a result, the incidence of adverse reactions in short-term trials may not reflect the rates after longer term exposures. Monitor for adverse reactions, including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) or akathisia, and patient response for several weeks after starting VRAYLAR and after each dosage increase. Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing the drug.  Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotics have caused metabolic changes, such as: • Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Hyperglycemia, in some cases associated with ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma, or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Assess fasting glucose before or soon after initiation of treatment, and monitor periodically during long-term treatment. • Dyslipidemia: Atypical antipsychotics cause adverse alterations in lipids. Before or soon after starting an antipsychotic, obtain baseline fasting lipid profile and monitor periodically during treatment. • Weight Gain: Weight gain has been observed with VRAYLAR. Monitor weight at baseline and frequently thereafter.  Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis: Leukopenia/neutropenia have been reported with antipsychotics, including VRAYLAR. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has been reported with other antipsychotics. Monitor complete blood count in patients with pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC)/absolute neutrophil count or history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Discontinue VRAYLAR at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC and in severely neutropenic patients.  Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope: Atypical antipsychotics cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope, with the greatest risk during initial titration and with dose increases. Monitor orthostatic vital signs in patients predisposed to hypotension and in those with cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases.  Falls: VRAYLAR may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures, or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotics and recurrently for patients on long-term therapy.  Seizures: Use VRAYLAR with caution in patients with history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold.  Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment: Somnolence was reported with VRAYLAR. Caution patients about performing activities requiring mental alertness (eg, operating hazardous machinery or a motor vehicle).  Body Temperature Dysregulation: Use VRAYLAR with caution in patients who may experience conditions that increase body temperature (eg, strenuous exercise, extreme heat, dehydration, or concomitant anticholinergics).  Dysphagia: Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotics. Antipsychotic drugs, including VRAYLAR, should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration.  Drug Interactions: Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increase VRAYLAR concentrations, so VRAYLAR dose reduction is recommended. Concomitant use with CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended.  Adverse Reactions: In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (?5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) are listed below: • Schizophrenia: The incidences within the recommended dose range (VRAYLAR 1.5 – 3 mg/day and 4.5 – 6 mg/day vs placebo) were: EPS (15%, 19% vs 8%) and akathisia (9%, 13% vs 4%). • Bipolar mania: The incidences within the recommended dose range (VRAYLAR 3 – 6 mg/day vs placebo) were: EPS (26% vs 12%), akathisia (20% vs 5%), vomiting (10% vs 4%), dyspepsia (7% vs 4%), somnolence (7% vs 4%), and restlessness (7% vs 2%). • Bipolar depression: The incidences within the recommended doses (VRAYLAR 1.5 mg/day or 3 mg/day vs placebo) were: nausea (7%, 7% vs 3%), akathisia (6%, 10% vs 2%), restlessness (2%, 7% vs 3%), and EPS (4%, 6% vs 2%).

"May 17, 2019",Allergan Expands PLEDGE Clinical Research Program in Diabetic Gastroparesis,", /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE: AGN) today announced the expansion of the PLEDGE program with a fifth study now evaluating relamorelin, an investigational, ghrelin agonist being studied for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis (DG). Recruitment remains underway for the pivotal Phase 3 studies RLM-MD-01 and RLM-MD-02. Patients who complete 52 weeks of the Phase 3 program will now be eligible for the RLM 3071-305-020 open-label study to evaluate the long-term safety of the investigational drug.  This new study (RLM 3071-305-020) will follow participants for up to five years to provide additional information on the long-term safety profile of relamorelin.1 It also enables eligible patients to potentially have access to relamorelin until it is commercially available. The clinical goal of this study is to collect additional information on the long-term safety of relamorelin in this highly challenging patient population.1  Diabetes is the leading cause of gastroparesis and affects millions of diabetic patients.2 It is a disorder in which there is a substantial delay in stomach emptying and is characterized by nausea, vomiting, bloating, and other gastrointestinal complications.3 This delay can worsen a patient's diabetes by making it more difficult to manage blood sugar,3 which is of paramount importance to patients with diabetes.4  ""The goal of managing diabetes is to keep blood sugar levels within a safe range. This is problematic in people with diabetic gastroparesis, or DG, because they cannot predict when the food or medicine will be absorbed and what impact this delay will have on their blood sugar levels,"" said Dr. , MD, PhD, Gastroenterologist at Mayo Clinic Jacksonville. ""New research, as done through the current PLEDGE program, is greatly needed as there are currently limited therapeutic options for patients living with DG.""  PLEDGE is a multi-study, patient-centric program designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of relamorelin in people with DG. initiated the PLEDGE program following the results of a Phase 2b study that showed improvements in many of the core symptoms of DG compared to placebo.5  ""The PLEDGE program is one of many commitments to patients that could change treatment paradigms across gastroenterology,"" said , Chief R&D Officer, . ""We're eager to continue enrolling additional patients and remain dedicated to helping the millions of people suffering from the debilitating effects of DG.""  For more information on the PLEDGE program, or to participate, visit www.AllerganDG.com.  Relamorelin is a potent ghrelin agonist in development for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis.6 Relamorelin is administered via subcutaneous injection.7 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( ) has granted Fast Track designation to relamorelin for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis.  More About the PLEDGE Clinical Research Program  PLEDGE consists of five studies with up to a five-year commitment.: • RLM-MD-01 and RLM-MD-02 are two identical, pivotal, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of relamorelin compared to placebo;7,8 Currently enrolling; • RLM-MD-03 is a long-term extension roll-over (from -01 and -02) placebo-controlled trial that evaluates the safety and efficacy of relamorelin treatment for up to one year;9 • RLM-MD-04 is a non-pivotal 12-month study in less severe DG patients evaluating the safety and efficacy of relamorelin treatment;10 • RLM 3071-305-020 is a Phase 3b open-label extension trial which will enroll patients who complete either -03 or -04.5  Diabetic gastroparesis is a disorder in patients with diabetes in which there is a substantial delay in stomach emptying with characteristic signs and symptoms of vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, early satiety, postprandial fullness, and bloating.3 Moderate to severe diabetic gastroparesis results in significant debility and hospitalizations and can interfere with nutrition and the absorption of medications.11 Up to 50 percent of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have been found to have delayed gastric emptying.12 However, diagnosed prevalence of symptomatic diabetic gastroparesis has been estimated to be as low as five percent of patients with type 1 diabetes and one percent of patients with type 2 diabetes, possibly reflecting under-recognition in clinical practice.2 There is high unmet need in this patient population as available therapies to treat this disorder are limited and may exhibit significant side effects.13  (NYSE: AGN), headquartered in , is a global pharmaceutical leader focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing branded pharmaceutical, device, biologic, surgical and regenerative medicine products for patients around the world. markets a portfolio of leading brands and best-in-class products primarily focused on four key therapeutic areas including medical aesthetics, eye care, central nervous system and gastroenterology.

"May 15, 2019",Allergan to Present VRAYLAR® (cariprazine) Data at the American Psychiatric Association (APA) 2019 Annual Meeting Highlighting Continued Commitment to Mental Health,", /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE: AGN), a leading global pharmaceutical company, today announced it will showcase data during the upcoming (APA) Annual Meeting in , – . Data being presented include research on VRAYLAR® (cariprazine) that investigates its use for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (bipolar depression) in adult patients.  ""We are looking forward to sharing data at APA this year that further support the value of VRAYLAR, which now has 10 positive pivotal trials across bipolar I disorder and schizophrenia,"" said , at . ""We are particularly encouraged by the data related to bipolar depression. The potential to treat the full spectrum of bipolar I symptoms, specifically, manic, mixed and depressive episodes, with a single agent, presents an opportunity to streamline treatment decisions for this complicated disorder.""  Cariprazine data for bipolar I disorder and cognition symptoms in schizophrenia will be featured in two posters at APA, which will be presented by two leading psychiatry experts, and . The titles of the poster presentations are as follows – all noted in local Pacific Time (PT): • Cariprazine Efficacy in Patients With Bipolar Depression and Concurrent Manic Symptoms: Post Hoc Analysis of 3 Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Studies (#P8-080). Presented by ( – , Moscone South, Exhibition Level, -4). • Effects of Cariprazine on Attentional Processes in Patients With Schizophrenia: Post Hoc Analysis From a Randomized, Controlled Phase III Study (#P7-043). Presented by ( – , Moscone South, Exhibition Level, -4).  Cariprazine was approved by the in and is marketed as VRAYLAR in the U.S. for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults and the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. More than 500,000 prescriptions have been written by more than 20,000 prescribers who have treated more than 100,000 patients with VRAYLAR.  VRAYLAR is an oral, once daily atypical antipsychotic approved for the acute treatment of adult patients with manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, with a recommended dose range of 3 to 6 mg/day, and for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults, with a recommended dose range of 1.5 to 6 mg/day.  While the mechanism of action of VRAYLAR is unknown, the efficacy of VRAYLAR could be mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at central dopamine D? and serotonin 5-HT receptors and antagonist activity at serotonin 5-HT receptors. Pharmacodynamic studies with cariprazine have shown that it acts as a partial agonist with high binding affinity at dopamine D , dopamine D , and serotonin 5-HT receptors. Cariprazine demonstrated up to ~8-fold greater in vitro affinity for dopamine D vs D receptors. Cariprazine also acts as an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT and 5-HT receptors with high and moderate binding affinity, respectively as well as it binds to the histamine H receptors.  Cariprazine shows lower binding affinity to the serotonin 5-HT and ? - adrenergic receptors and has no appreciable affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors. The clinical significance of these in vitro data is unknown.  VRAYLAR was discovered and co-developed by Gedeon Richter Plc and is licensed by Allergan, in the U.S. and Canada. For more than a decade both companies have conducted over 20 clinical trials enrolling thousands of patients worldwide to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cariprazine for people living with a broad range of mental health illnesses.  INDICATION AND USAGE  VRAYLAR (cariprazine) is indicated in adults for the treatment of schizophrenia and for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder.  Contraindication: VRAYLAR is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity. Reactions have included rash, pruritus, urticaria, and events suggestive of angioedema.  Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke: In clinical trials with antipsychotic drugs, elderly subjects with dementia had a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions, including fatalities vs placebo. VRAYLAR is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.  Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): NMS, a potentially fatal symptom complex, has been reported with antipsychotic drugs. NMS may cause hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, delirium, and autonomic instability. Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. Manage with immediate discontinuation, intensive symptomatic treatment, and monitoring.  Tardive Dyskinesia (TD): Risk of developing TD (a syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements) and the likelihood it will become irreversible may increase with the duration of treatment and the cumulative dose. The syndrome can develop after a relatively brief treatment period, even at low doses, or after treatment discontinuation. If signs and symptoms of TD appear, drug discontinuation should be considered.  Late-Occurring Adverse Reactions: Adverse events may first appear several weeks after initiation of VRAYLAR, probably because plasma levels of cariprazine and its major metabolites accumulate over time. As a result, the incidence of adverse reactions in short-term trials may not reflect the rates after longer term exposures. Monitor for adverse reactions, including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) or akathisia, and patient response for several weeks after starting VRAYLAR and after each dosage increase. Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing the drug.  Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotics have caused metabolic changes, such as: • Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Hyperglycemia, in some cases associated with ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma, or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Assess fasting glucose before or soon after initiation of treatment, and monitor periodically during long-term treatment. • Dyslipidemia: Atypical antipsychotics cause adverse alterations in lipids. Before or soon after starting an antipsychotic, obtain baseline fasting lipid profile and monitor periodically during treatment. • Weight Gain: Weight gain has been observed with VRAYLAR. Monitor weight at baseline and frequently thereafter.  Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis: Leukopenia/neutropenia have been reported with antipsychotics, including VRAYLAR. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has been reported with other antipsychotics. Monitor complete blood count in patients with pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC)/absolute neutrophil count or history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Discontinue VRAYLAR at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC and in severely neutropenic patients.  Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope: Atypical antipsychotics cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope, with the greatest risk during initial titration and with dose increases. Monitor orthostatic vital signs in patients predisposed to hypotension and in those with cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases.  Falls: VRAYLAR may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures, or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotics and recurrently for patients on long-term therapy.  Seizures: Use VRAYLAR with caution in patients with history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold.  Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment: Somnolence was reported with VRAYLAR. Caution patients about performing activities requiring mental alertness (eg, operating hazardous machinery or a motor vehicle).  Body Temperature Dysregulation: Use VRAYLAR with caution in patients who may experience conditions that increase body temperature (eg, strenuous exercise, extreme heat, dehydration, or concomitant anticholinergics).  Dysphagia: Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotics. Antipsychotic drugs, including VRAYLAR, should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration.  Drug Interactions: Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increase VRAYLAR concentrations, so VRAYLAR dose reduction is recommended. Concomitant use with CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended.  Adverse Reactions: In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (?5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) are listed below: • Schizophrenia: The incidences within the recommended dose range (VRAYLAR 1.5 – 3 mg/day and 4.5 – 6 mg/day vs placebo) were: EPS (15%, 19% vs 8%) and akathisia (9%, 13% vs 4%) • Bipolar mania: The incidences within the recommended dose range (VRAYLAR 3 – 6 mg/day vs placebo) were: EPS (26% vs 12%), akathisia (20% vs 5%), dyspepsia (7% vs 4%), vomiting (10% vs 4%), somnolence (7% vs 4%), and restlessness (7% vs 2%)  Please also see full Prescribing Information, including Boxed Warning.

Non-GAAP performance net income per share is used by management as one of the primary metrics in evaluating the Company's performance. We believe that Non-GAAP performance net income per share enhances the comparability of our results between periods and provides additional information and transparency to investors on adjustments and other items that are not indicative of the Company's current and future operating performance. These are the financial measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make day to day operating decisions. We define non-GAAP adjustments to the reported GAAP measures as GAAP results adjusted for the following net of tax: (i) amortization expenses, (ii) global supply chain and operational excellence initiatives or other restructurings of a similar nature, (iii) acquisition, divestiture, integration and licensing charges, (iv) accretion and fair market value adjustments on contingent liabilities, (v) impairment/asset sales and related costs, including the exclusion of discontinued operations, (vi) legal settlements and (vii) other unusual charges or expenses. Non-GAAP performance net income per share is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for reported GAAP continuing operations loss per share. The Company has consistently excluded amortization and impairments of all intangible assets, including the product rights that generate a significant portion of our ongoing revenue. The Company's total accumulated amortization, including impairments of currently marketed products, related to our intangible assets as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $33.6 billion and $32.3 billion, respectively, and is expected to continue to be a material non-GAAP adjustment. The following table presents Allergan plc's GAAP to Non-GAAP adjustments for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018: The non-GAAP income tax expense is determined based on our pre-tax income, adjusted for non-GAAP items on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. The non-GAAP effective tax rate in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was impacted by U.S. income taxed at rates higher than the Irish statutory rate, partially offset by income earned in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the Irish statutory rate. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019 excludes a net discrete tax benefit of approximately $68.4 million related to the recognition of an outside basis difference offset by share-based compensation and other individually insignificant items.",https://news.abbvie.com/news/allergan-press-releases/allergan-reports-first-quarter-2019-financial-results.htm,https://www.abbvie.com/content/experience-fragments/abbvie-com/us/en/header/master/_jcr_content/root/globalnavigation/logo.coreimg.svg/1648149043863/logo.svg,Allergan

Indications  BOTOX® is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used: • To prevent headaches in adults with chronic migraine who have 15 or more days each month with headache lasting 4 or more hours each day in people 18 years or older • To treat certain types of eye muscle problems (strabismus) or abnormal spasm of the eyelids (blepharospasm) in people 12 years and older  It is not known whether BOTOX® is safe or effective to prevent headaches in patients with migraine who have 14 or fewer headache days each month (episodic migraine).  It is not known whether BOTOX® is safe or effective for other types of muscle spasms.  IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION  BOTOX® may cause serious side effects that can be life threatening. Get medical help right away if you have any of these problems any time (hours to weeks) after injection of BOTOX®: • Problems swallowing, speaking, or breathing, due to weakening of associated muscles, can be severe and result in loss of life. You are at highest risk if these problems are pre-existing before injection. Swallowing problems may last for several months. • Spread of toxin effects. The effect of botulinum toxin may affect areas away from the injection site and cause serious symptoms including: loss of strength and all-over muscle weakness, double vision, blurred vision and drooping eyelids, hoarseness or change or loss of voice, trouble saying words clearly, loss of bladder control, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing.  There has not been a confirmed serious case of spread of toxin effect away from the injection site when BOTOX® has been used at the recommended dose to treat chronic migraine, blepharospasm, or strabismus.    BOTOX® may cause loss of strength or general muscle weakness, vision problems, or dizziness within hours to weeks of taking BOTOX®. If this happens, do not drive a car, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities.    Do not receive BOTOX® if you: are allergic to any of its ingredients (see Medication Guide for ingredients); had an allergic reaction to any other botulinum toxin product such as Myobloc® (rimabotulinumtoxinB), Dysport® (abobotulinumtoxinA), or Xeomin® (incobotulinumtoxinA); have a skin infection at the planned injection site.     The dose of BOTOX® is not the same as, or comparable to, another botulinum toxin product.  Serious and/or immediate allergic reactions have been reported, including itching, rash, red itchy welts, wheezing, asthma symptoms, or dizziness or feeling faint. Get medical help right away if you experience symptoms; further injection of BOTOX® should be discontinued.    Tell your doctor about all your muscle or nerve conditions such as ALS or disease, myasthenia gravis, or Lambert-Eaton syndrome, as you may be at increased risk of serious side effects including difficulty swallowing and difficulty breathing from typical doses of BOTOX®.  Cornea problems have been reported. Cornea (surface of the eye) problems have been reported in some people receiving BOTOX® for their blepharospasm, especially in people with certain nerve disorders. BOTOX® may cause the eyelids to blink less, which could lead to the surface of the eye being exposed to air more than is usual. Tell your doctor if you experience any problems with your eyes while receiving BOTOX®. Your doctor may treat your eyes with drops, ointments, contact lenses, or with an eye patch.  Bleeding behind the eye has been reported. Bleeding behind the eyeball has been reported in some people receiving BOTOX® for their strabismus. Tell your doctor if you notice any new visual problems while receiving BOTOX®.  Tell your doctor about all your medical conditions, including if you: have or have had bleeding problems; have plans to have surgery; had surgery on your face; weakness of forehead muscles; trouble raising your eyebrows; drooping eyelids; any other abnormal facial change; are pregnant or plan to become pregnant (it is not known if BOTOX® can harm your unborn baby); are breastfeeding or plan to (it is not known if BOTOX® passes into breast milk).    Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Using BOTOX® with certain medicines may cause serious side effects. Do not start any new medicines until you have told your doctor that you received BOTOX® in the past.  Tell your doctor if you received any other botulinum toxin product in the last 4 months; have received injections of botulinum toxin such as Myobloc®, Dysport®, or Xeomin® in the past (tell your doctor exactly which product you received); have recently received an antibiotic injection; take muscle relaxants; take allergy or cold medicines; take sleep medicine; take aspirin-like products or blood thinners.    Other side effects of BOTOX® include: dry mouth, discomfort or pain at injection site, tiredness, headache, neck pain, eye problems: double vision, blurred vision, decreased eyesight, drooping eyelids, swelling of eyelids, and dry eyes; drooping eyebrows.

About Ubrogepant   Ubrogepant is an orally-administered CGRP receptor antagonist in development for the acute treatment of migraine. CGRP and its receptors are expressed in regions of the nervous system associated with migraine pathophysiology. CGRP receptor antagonism is a novel mechanism of action for the acute treatment of migraine that differs from the mechanisms of currently available triptans (serotonin 1B/1D agonists), opioids and ergots.  About Atogepant  Atogepant is an orally-administered CGRP receptor antagonist in development for the prevention of migraine. CGRP and its receptors are expressed in regions of the nervous system associated with migraine pathophysiology. It is chemically distinct from ubrogepant, our investigational orally-administered CGRP receptor antagonist for the acute treatment of migraine, and has demonstrated in preclinical studies to have a higher potency and longer half-life, making it potentially suitable for preventive treatment.  About Migraine   Migraine is a chronic disease with episodic attacks defined by neurological symptoms such as headache pain, sensitivity to light and sound, and nausea; these symptoms are often incapacitating. Migraine is highly prevalent, affecting approximately 1 in 7 individuals, and is associated with significant disability leading to high personal, family, societal, and economic burden. Despite its prevalence and the availability of treatments, migraine is an underdiagnosed and undertreated disease. There is a need for new treatments for migraine with improved benefit-risk profiles to fulfill this unmet need.  , a leader in the migraine space, markets BOTOX® (onabotulinumtoxinA) the first FDA-approved, preventive treatment for adult Chronic Migraine patients since it was approved in 2010. Allergan is also advancing its migraine program with two investigational small molecule oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists, which are being developed for the acute treatment and prevention of migraine. The U.S. has accepted the company's New Drug Application (NDA) for ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine in adults, and a PDUFA date is expected in the fourth quarter of 2019. Ubrogepant is expected to be the first oral CGRP receptor antagonist to market. In addition, atogepant is currently in Phase 3 development for the prevention of migraine.  About Allergan MIND™   As part of Allergan's ongoing commitment to innovating and inspiring change in the migraine community, the company has established a migraine franchise, Allergan MIND™ (Migraine: Innovation, Navigation, Discovery), to drive progress and unify its efforts as a worldwide leader in migraine.

Commenting on the ISS and reports, Board of Directors said: ""We are pleased with the support we have received from both leading independent proxy advisory firms recommending FOR all of the Company's proposals and AGAINST a proposal calling for the immediate separation of Chairman and CEO roles. Their recommendations affirm our position that our plan to adopt separate Chair and CEO positions with the next leadership transition is the best approach for shareholders. The Board and management team are fully focused on improving the company's operational and financial performance and creating value for shareholders.""  ""In this case, the board has already been responsive to the request of the prior year's proposal by adopting an independent chair policy to be phased in at the next CEO transition. It has also adopted a robust lead independent director role, with clearly delineated and extensive duties, and has substantially refreshed itself appointing six new directors since 2016…there are no significant concerns regarding the board's current leadership structure sufficient to suggest that an immediate split of the CEO and chairman roles is warranted at this time rather than at the next CEO transition. As such, support for this proposal is not warranted.""  In supporting leadership structure, noted the following:  ""We are not convinced that adoption of this proposal is necessary at this time, given the board's stated intention to phase in an independent director as chair at the time of the next CEO transition. We recognize that, until that time, the board will not have separated chair/CEO roles. However, we believe that the Company's phasing in of this policy upon the next CEO transition essentially implements the request of this proposal. Accordingly, we do not believe that adoption of this proposal would affect any meaningful change in the Company's leadership structure following the next CEO transition. Thus, we do not believe support for this measure is warranted at this time.""

It is our responsibility to better understand the perspectives and needs of the patients and physicians we serve, as well as continue to educate consumers.""  To develop the report, tapped into more than 14,500 aesthetically conscious consumers and 1,300 aesthetic physicians in 18 countries, including , , , , the , , , , , , , , , , , , and . An advisory board of globally-renowned physicians partnered with to interpret the data and bring the findings to life.*  Results indicated that consumer interest in medical aesthetics is at an all-time high, but there are significant gaps between what consumers and practitioners expect from treatments.  ""As physicians, there is much we can learn about our patients from the 360 Aesthetics Report – from how beauty is defined across cultures to how women and men around the world prioritize and go about achieving their aesthetic goals,"" says -based dermatologist Dr. . ""We know there is an increasing desire for knowledge about facial injectables, skincare, and body treatments, and this eye-opening report will ultimately lead to more informed and honest conversations between practitioners and their patients.""  In an age where social media is prevalent and filters are the new standard, digital platforms have become a forum for beauty conversation and discovery.  The study found that 28% (n=14,584) of global consumers turn to the internet as their first stop when searching for a dermatologist or plastic surgeon for an aesthetic treatment and 82% (n=351) of U.S. consumers (ages 21-35) turn to Instagram as their leading source of information.*  ""As with everything else that has evolved in the cosmetic industry, so too have aesthetic patients in being more mainstream, reaching out through social media, and using before and after photos as references,"" says -based plastic surgeon Dr. . ""They are more educated than ever, since the digital world has enabled a constant flow of information when using these platforms for research. Regardless of the changing landscape, there still needs to be a responsible degree of education from treating physicians.""  According to the report, more than half the millennials surveyed would consider a surgical or non-surgical intervention to enhance their appearance, with 61% agreeing their overall appearance impacts how successful they are in life (n= 928).*  ""When the question is no longer 'if' I should consider treatment, but 'when' I should consider it, the conversation with the physician changes,"" says Dr. Fabi. ""In the past, we saw patients for aesthetic treatments before a big event such as a wedding or reunion, whereas now we see them on a more regular basis, and they use words like 'preventative care'.""  Global perspectives on aesthetic treatments are shifting and consumers are more motivated to make changes as part of their lifestyle choices.  ""We are a maintenance-focused society. The same people who are committing to monthly gym memberships and private sessions with trainers are requesting body contouring procedures when they come in for their facial injectable treatments,"" says Dr. Swift.  This is not a surprise, as 68% (n=3,028) say looking their best is an important part of their daily activities (such as career, volunteering, and running errands) and 53% (n=14,584) of consumers globally would consider a non-invasive body contouring treatment. Other top concerns globally were facial lines or wrinkles around the eyes, with 32% (n=14,457) of consumers worldwide currently considering a facial injectable treatment.*  Visit 360aestheticsreport.com to access the full 360 Aesthetics Report, providing a deeper look at the differing perspectives and attitudes across the world.

"Apr 02, 2019",Allergan and Molecular Partners Announce Topline Safety Results from MAPLE study of Abicipar pegol,", /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE: AGN), a leading global pharmaceutical company and (SIX: MOLN), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a new class of drugs known as DARPin® therapies, today announced topline safety results from MAPLE, a 28 week open-label study which enrolled 123 age-related Neovascular Macular Degeneration (nAMD) patients and evaluated the safety of abicipar produced via a modified manufacturing process. In this single arm study, treatment naïve or prior anti-VEGF treated patients received three monthly 2mg abicipar injections followed by 2mg injections every 8 weeks for up to a total of five injections through week 28.  As a result of the improvements in the manufacturing process, the incidence of intraocular inflammation (IOI) was 8.9 percent in the MAPLE study, which was lower than the rate observed in prior Phase 3 studies. Most IOI events were assessed as mild to moderate in severity. The incidence of severe IOI was 1.6 percent with one reported case of iritis and one reported case of uveitis. There were no reported cases of endophthalmitis or retinal vasculitis in this study.  ""It is encouraging to see the lower incidence and type of IOI observed in this open label 28-week study,"" said Raj Maturi, MD, , . ""In the Phase 3 trials previously reported, abicipar demonstrated potential that could transform the way physicians manage nAMD with anti-VEGF therapy. Abicipar could be the first fixed 12- week anti-VEGF treatment that improves visual outcomes in a real world setting for a large number of AMD patients.""  ""The results of this open-label study enabled us to assess improvements to the manufacturing process for abicipar. The safety profile demonstrated in MAPLE gives us confidence to proceed and scale up manufacturing,"" said , and Development Officer, . ""We plan to submit the abicipar BLA and continue to pursue manufacturing process improvements as we develop larger scale studies in additional disease states, such as Diabetic Macular Edema.""  ""Clinical trial evidence has shown that fixed-interval dosing of anti-VEGF therapies administered either every month or every 8 weeks results in better visual outcomes compared to real world clinical outcomes. Abicipar could potentially be the first anti-VEGF therapy that is administered every 12 weeks with demonstrated maintenance of visual acuity for a large number of patients with nAMD. A fixed-interval Q12-week therapy would greatly reduce the treatment burden for these patients,"" said , MD, Chaney Family Endowed Chair in and Professor of Ophthalmology, .  ""Abicipar is our first DARPin® candidate on track for BLA submission with the aim to become the first fixed 12-week anti VEGF drug in all patients with nAMD,"" commented , COO of . He added: ""The safety data from the MAPLE trial are an important step in the further improvement of the manufacturing process of abicipar.""  expects to file the abicipar Biologics License Application (BLA) with the ( ) in the first half of 2019. Additional data from the MAPLE study will be presented at a scientific conference later in 2019.  and previously announced results from two positive Phase 3 clinical trials, CEDAR and SEQUOIA for abicipar, a novel DARPin® therapy for the treatment of nAMD, demonstrating that both the 8-week and 12-week fixed-interval treatment regimens met the pre-specified primary endpoint of non-inferiority to ranibizumab. The primary endpoint measured the proportion of treated patients with stable vision at week 52. In both studies abicipar demonstrated similar efficacy after 6 or 8 injections, compared to 13 ranibizumab injections in the first year of this study.  In the CEDAR study, overall treatment-emergent adverse events were similar among the three treatment arms and reported in 73.7 percent, 81.1 percent and 73.2 percent of patients receiving abicipar Q8, abicipar Q12 and ranibizumab Q4, respectively. Incidence of intraocular inflammation events was similar among the two abicipar treatment groups but higher than the ranibizumab group and reported at 15.1 percent and 15.4 percent of patients in the abicipar Q8 and Q12 arms compared to 0 percent in the ranibizumab Q4.  In the SEQUOIA study, overall treatment-emergent adverse events were similar among the three treatment arms and reported in 78.3 percent, 78.0 percent and 74.0 percent of patients receiving abicipar Q8, abicipar Q12 and ranibizumab Q4, respectively. Incidence of intraocular inflammation events was similar among the two abicipar treatment groups but higher than the ranibizumab group and reported at 15.7 percent and 15.3 percent of patients in the abicipar Q8 and Q12 arms compared to 0.6 percent in the ranibizumab Q4 arm.  plc (NYSE: AGN), headquartered in Dublin, , is a bold, global pharmaceutical leader.

The label expansion was approved based on results from two active-controlled clinical studies evaluating AVYCAZ in children or infants with cIAI or cUTI, as well as a single-dose pharmacokinetic study. In the cIAI study, the safety and efficacy of AVYCAZ (in combination with metronidazole) was compared with meropenem. In the cUTI study, AVYCAZ was compared with cefepime.  Across the trials, 128 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 18 years of age were treated with AVYCAZ. Overall, the findings from the pediatric studies were similar to the previous determination of safety for AVYCAZ for the treatment of adult patients with cIAI or cUTI, and no new safety concerns were identified in pediatric patients.  The primary objectives of the studies were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AVYCAZ, and they were not powered for a statistical analysis of efficacy. The descriptive efficacy analyses in the pediatric studies were consistent with data from studies in adults with cIAI and cUTI. In the pediatric cIAI study, the clinical cure rate at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population was 91.8% (56/61) in the AVYCAZ plus metronidazole group and 95.5% (21/22) in the meropenem group. Clinical cure rates for the predominant pathogens, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were 90.5% and 85.7%, respectively for patients treated with AVYCAZ plus metronidazole, and 92.3% and 88.9%, respectively, for patients treated with meropenem. In the pediatric cUTI study, the combined favorable clinical and microbiological response rate at TOC in the microbiological-ITT population was 72.2% (39/54) in the AVYCAZ group and 60.9% (14/23) in the cefepime group. The microbiologic response rate for E.coli, the most common uropathogen identified in the study, was 79.6% for patients treated with AVYCAZ and 59.1% for patients treated with cefepime.  AVYCAZ was first approved by the in for the treatment of cUTI including pyelonephritis, and cIAI in combination with metronidazole, caused by designated susceptible bacteria including certain Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, for patients 18 years of age and older. AVYCAZ was subsequently approved for the treatment of adults with hospital-acquired pneumonia / ventilator-associated pneumonia (HABP/VABP) caused by designated susceptible bacteria in February 2018.  AVYCAZ is a fixed-dose combination antibacterial indicated for the treatment of cIAI (in combination with metronidazole), and cUTI caused by designated susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms in patients 3 months or older. AVYCAZ is also indicated for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) in adults. AVYCAZ consists of a combination of avibactam and ceftazidime.  Avibactam is a first-in-class non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor which protects ceftazidime against degradation by certain beta-lactamases. Avibactam does not decrease the activity of ceftazidime against ceftazidime-susceptible organisms. Ceftazadime is a third-generation cephalosporin with a well-established efficacy and safety profile.  AVYCAZ has demonstrated in vitro activity against Enterobacteriaceae in the presence of some beta-lactamases and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) of the following groups: TEM, SHV, CTX-M, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPCs), AmpC and certain oxacillinases (OXA). AVYCAZ also demonstrated in vitro activity against P. aeruginosa in the presence of some AmpC beta-lactamases, and certain strains lacking outer membrane porin (OprD). AVYCAZ is not active against bacteria that produce metallo-beta lactamases and may not have activity against Gram-negative bacteria that overexpress efflux pumps or have porin mutations.  Ceftazidime and avibactam is being jointly developed with Pfizer. holds the rights to commercialize ceftazidime and avibactam in under the brand name AVYCAZ, while Pfizer holds the rights to commercialize the combination in the rest of the world under the brand name ZAVICEFTA®.""  Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections (cIAI)  AVYCAZ (ceftazidime and avibactam), in combination with metronidazole, is indicated for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) in adult and pediatric patients 3 months or older caused by the following susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter freundii complex, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTI), including Pyelonephritis  AVYCAZ is indicated for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) including pyelonephritis in adult and pediatric patients 3 months or older caused by the following susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii complex, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  Hospital-acquired Bacterial Pneumonia and Ventilator-associated Bacterial Pneumonia (HABP/VABP)  AVYCAZ is indicated for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) in patients 18 years or older caused by the following susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae.  Usage  To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of AVYCAZ and other antibacterial drugs, AVYCAZ should be used to treat only indicated infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.  CONTRAINDICATIONS  AVYCAZ is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to the components of AVYCAZ (ceftazidime and avibactam), avibactam-containing products, or other members of the cephalosporin class. • In a Phase 3 cIAI trial in adult patients, clinical cure rates were lower in a subgroup of patients with baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30 to less than or equal to 50 mL/min compared to those with CrCl greater than 50 mL/min. The reduction in clinical cure rates was more marked in patients treated with AVYCAZ plus metronidazole compared to meropenem-treated patients. Within this subgroup, patients treated with AVYCAZ received a 33% lower daily dose than is currently recommended for patients with CrCl of 30 to less than or equal to 50 mL/min. Clinical cure rate in patients with normal renal function/mild renal impairment (CrCl greater than 50 mL/min) was 85% (322/379) with AVYCAZ plus metronidazole vs 86% (321/373) with meropenem, and clinical cure rate in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to less than or equal to 50 mL/min) was 45% (14/31) with AVYCAZ plus metronidazole vs 74% (26/35) with meropenem. The decreased clinical response was not observed for patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline (CrCl 30 to less than or equal to 50 mL/min) in the Phase 3 cUTI trials or the Phase 3 HABP/VABP trial. Monitor CrCl at least daily in adult and pediatric patients with changing renal function and adjust the dosage of AVYCAZ accordingly. • Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions and serious skin reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterial drugs. Before therapy with AVYCAZ is instituted, careful inquiry about previous hypersensitivity reactions to other cephalosporins, penicillins, or carbapenems should be made. Exercise caution if this product is to be given to a penicillin or other beta-lactam-allergic patient because cross sensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial drugs has been established. Discontinue the drug if an allergic reaction to AVYCAZ occurs. • Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial drugs, including AVYCAZ, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial drugs. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, antibacterials not directed against C. difficile should be discontinued, if possible. • Seizures, nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), encephalopathy, coma, asterixis, neuromuscular excitability, and myoclonia have been reported in patients treated with ceftazidime, particularly in the setting of renal impairment. Adjust dosing based on CrCl. • Prescribing AVYCAZ in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.  ADVERSE REACTIONS  Adult cIAI, cUTI and HABP/VABP Patients:  The most common adverse reactions in adult patients with cIAI (? 5% when used with metronidazole) were diarrhea (8%), nausea (7%), and vomiting (5%). The most common adverse reactions in adult patients with cUTI (3%) were diarrhea and nausea. The most common adverse reactions in adult patients with HABP/VABP (? 5%) were diarrhea (15%) and vomiting (6%).  Pediatric cIAI and cUTI Patients:  The most common adverse reactions in pediatric patients with cIAI and cUTI (>3%) were vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and infusion site phlebitis.

"Mar 11, 2019",Allergan Announces FDA Acceptance of New Drug Application for Ubrogepant for the Acute Treatment of Migraine,", /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE: AGN) today announced that the ( ) has accepted the company's New Drug Application (NDA) for ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. The NDA filing is based on the successful completion of four clinical trials – two pivotal studies, ACHIEVE I and ACHIEVE II, which demonstrated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ubrogepant, as well as two additional safety studies. A 10-month review period has been assigned with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) in the fourth quarter of 2019.  ""Following the acceptance and expected review of this NDA, we anticipate ubrogepant to be the first approved oral CGRP receptor antagonist for the acute treatment of migraine, and may be used in conjunction with other available migraine treatments,"" said , and Development Officer, . ""As a leader in Chronic Migraine research for more than 20 years, looks to provide options for patients who need new acute and preventative treatments for migraine. In addition to ubrogepant, we are continuing to advance the Phase 3 clinical program for atogepant, the company's second orally-administered investigational CGRP receptor antagonist specifically for migraine prevention.""  In the four clinical studies (ACHIEVE I, ACHIEVE II, UBR-MD-04 and 3110-105-002) supporting the NDA, ubrogepant demonstrated efficacy, safety and tolerability in the acute treatment of migraine among a broad patient population, including those who had an insufficient response to a triptan or those patients in whom triptans were contraindicated, as well as in patients who had moderate to severe CV risk profile. Following are topline results from the key clinical studies: • The two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of orally administered ubrogepant (ACHIEVE I at 50 mg and 100 mg; and ACHIEVE II at 25 mg and 50 mg) compared to placebo to treat a single migraine attack in adults. • The 50 mg and 100 mg doses met the studies' co-primary endpoints, demonstrating a statistically significant greater percentage of ubrogepant patients achieving pain freedom and absence of most bothersome symptom at two hours after the initial dose as compared to placebo patients; there was continued separation from placebo up to 48 hours. • The 50 mg and 100 mg doses also met key secondary endpoints, demonstrating a statistically significant greater percentage of ubrogepant patients achieving pain relief at two hours after the initial dose compared to placebo patients. • Study UBR-MD-04: Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, 52-week open-label extension trial in which adults with migraine were randomized 1:1:1 to usual care, ubrogepant 50 mg, or ubrogepant 100 mg to assess long-term safety and tolerability. • Intermittent use of ubrogepant 50 mg or 100 mg for the acute treatment of migraine attacks over one year was well-tolerated. The three most frequently reported adverse events were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and sinusitis. • Study 3110-105-002: Phase 1, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group trial evaluated the safety and tolerability of ubrogepant 100 mg, focusing on hepatic safety in healthy participants administered high frequency intermittent dosing (2 days of ubrogepant 100 mg followed by 2 days of placebo for 8 consecutive weeks). • Ubrogepant 100 mg was well-tolerated following frequent dosing and was not associated with persistent increases in ALT/AST compared to placebo, supporting liver safety.  ""Despite its prevalence and burden, migraine remains an undertreated disease, with many patients continuing to seek additional treatment options from their physicians,"" said Dr. , a neurologist and Director of the Medstar Georgetown Headache Center. ""If approved, ubrogepant, the first innovation in the acute treatment of migraine in over 25 years, will be used across the entire spectrum of the disease (from episodic to chronic) helping patients achieve relief in the moments when they most demand it.""  About Ubrogepant   Ubrogepant is a novel, highly potent, orally-administered CGRP receptor antagonist in development for the acute treatment of migraine. CGRP and its receptors are expressed in regions of the nervous system associated with migraine pathophysiology. CGRP receptor antagonism is a novel mechanism of action for the acute treatment of migraine that clearly differs from the mechanisms of currently available triptans (serotonin 1B/1D agonists), opioids and ergots.  About Migraine   Migraine is a chronic disease with episodic attacks defined by neurological symptoms such as headache pain, sensitivity to light and sound, and nausea; these symptoms are often incapacitating. Migraine is highly prevalent, affecting approximately 1 in 7 individuals, and is associated with significant disability leading to high personal, family, societal, and economic burden. There is a need for new treatments for migraine with improved benefit-risk profiles as compared to current standard of care.  , a leader in the migraine space, markets BOTOX® (onabotulinumtoxinA) the first -approved, preventive treatment for adult Chronic Migraine patients since it was approved in 2010. is also advancing its migraine program with two investigational small molecule oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists, which are being developed for the acute treatment and prevention of migraine. CGRP receptor antagonist ubrogepant has been submitted to the for review for the acute treatment of migraine, and it is expected to be the first oral CGRP receptor antagonist to market; following will be atogepant, which is currently in Phase 3 development for the prevention of migraine.  About Allergan MIND™  As part of ongoing commitment to innovating and inspiring change in the migraine community, the company has established a migraine franchise, Allergan MIND™ (Migraine: Innovation, Navigation, Discovery), to drive progress and unify its efforts as a worldwide leader in migraine.

"Mar 07, 2019",FDA Accepts Supplemental Biologics License Applications (sBLAs) for BOTOX® (onabotulinumtoxinA) for Pediatric Patients with Upper and Lower Limb Spasticity,", /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE: AGN) today announced that the ( ) has accepted the company's supplemental biologics license applications (sBLAs) to expand the BOTOX® (onabotulinumtoxinA) label for the treatment of pediatric patients (2 years of age and older) with upper and lower limb spasticity. The pediatric upper limb spasticity indication has been designated a 6-month Priority Review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date expected in the second quarter of this year. The pediatric lower limb spasticity indication will undergo a standard 10-month review with a PDUFA date expected in the fourth quarter of 2019. Spasticity is a debilitating neurological condition involving muscle stiffness that can result in tight muscles in the upper and lower limbs. The most common cause of focal spasticity in children is cerebral palsy, which occurs in an estimated 2.5 per 1,000 live births globally. Nearly all patients with cerebral palsy have impaired motor function, with spasticity affecting as many as 91 percent.  BOTOX® is the first -approved neurotoxin treatment for both upper and lower limb spasticity in adults, 18 years and older. If approved, BOTOX® would be the first neurotoxin treatment indicated for use in both upper and lower limb pediatric spasticity.  ""The acceptance of supplemental biologics license applications is a monumental milestone on our journey to bring new treatment options to pediatric patients with upper and lower limb spasticity,"" said , and Development Officer, . ""BOTOX® has been used in a variety of therapeutic areas for the past 30 years since approval of blepharospasm and strabismus, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to investing in research that explores the potential benefits of BOTOX® in treating patients across an array of therapeutic areas.""  The sBLA submissions are based on data from four Phase 3 studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of BOTOX® in more than 600 pediatric patients with upper and lower limb spasticity.  ""Pediatric spasticity is a significant concern and can negatively impact a child's development and quality of life, interfering with everyday activities such as walking, dressing and playing,"" said , M.D., Pediatric Rehabilitation Medicine at Columbia University Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital. ""Spasticity management in pediatrics is critical while children are growing and adaptable. Considering the negative effects of long-term spasticity, it is important to provide continuum of care throughout childhood into adulthood. The positive results for BOTOX® for the treatment of pediatric upper and lower limb spasticity are promising as we look to address unmet and ongoing needs in children and adolescents.""  BOTOX® (onabotulinumtoxinA) is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used: • to treat increased muscle stiffness in elbow, wrist, finger, thumb, ankle, and toe muscles in people 18 years and older with upper and lower limb spasticity • to treat certain types of eye muscle problems (strabismus) or abnormal spasm of the eyelids (blepharospasm) in people 12 years and older  It is not known whether BOTOX® is safe or effective to treat increased stiffness in upper limb muscles other than those in the elbow, wrist, fingers, and thumb, or to treat increased stiffness in lower limb muscles other than those in the ankle and toes. BOTOX® has not been shown to help people perform task-specific functions with their upper limbs or increase movement in joints that are permanently fixed in position by stiff muscles. Treatment with BOTOX® is not meant to replace your existing physical therapy or other rehabilitation that your doctor may have prescribed.  It is not known whether BOTOX® is safe or effective for other types of muscle spasms.  BOTOX® may cause serious side effects that can be life threatening. Get medical help right away if you have any of these problems any time (hours to weeks) after injection of BOTOX®: • Problems swallowing, speaking, or breathing, due to weakening of associated muscles, can be severe and result in loss of life. You are at highest risk if these problems are pre-existing before injection. Swallowing problems may last for several months. • Spread of toxin effects. The effect of botulinum toxin may affect areas away from the injection site and cause serious symptoms including: loss of strength and all-over muscle weakness, double vision, blurred vision and drooping eyelids, hoarseness or change or loss of voice, trouble saying words clearly, loss of bladder control, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing.  There has not been a confirmed serious case of spread of toxin effect away from the injection site when BOTOX® has been used at the recommended dose to treatblepharospasm, or strabismus.  BOTOX® may cause loss of strength or general muscle weakness, vision problems, or dizziness within hours to weeks of taking BOTOX®. If this happens, do not drive a car, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities.  Do not receive BOTOX® if you: are allergic to any of its ingredients (see Medication Guide for ingredients); had an allergic reaction to any other botulinum toxin product such as Myobloc® (rimabotulinumtoxinB), Dysport® (abobotulinumtoxinA), or Xeomin® (incobotulinumtoxinA); have a skin infection at the planned injection site.  The dose of BOTOX® is not the same as, or comparable to, another botulinum toxin product.  Serious and/or immediate allergic reactions have been reported, including itching, rash, red itchy welts, wheezing, asthma symptoms, or dizziness or feeling faint. Get medical help right away if you experience symptoms; further injection of BOTOX® should be discontinued.  Tell your doctor about all your muscle or nerve conditions such as ALS or disease, myasthenia gravis, or Lambert-Eaton syndrome, as you may be at increased risk of serious side effects including difficulty swallowing and difficulty breathing from typical doses of BOTOX®.  Tell your doctor if you have any breathing-related problems. Your doctor may monitor you for breathing problems during your treatment with BOTOX® for spasticity. The risk of developing lung disease in patients with reduced lung function is increased in patients receiving BOTOX®.  Cornea problems have been reported. Cornea (surface of the eye) problems have been reported in some people receiving BOTOX® for their blepharospasm, especially in people with certain nerve disorders. BOTOX® may cause the eyelids to blink less, which could lead to the surface of the eye being exposed to air more than is usual. Tell your doctor if you experience any problems with your eyes while receiving BOTOX®. Your doctor may treat your eyes with drops, ointments, contact lenses, or with an eye patch.  Bleeding behind the eye has been reported. Bleeding behind the eyeball has been reported in some people receiving BOTOX® for their strabismus. Tell your doctor if you notice any new visual problems while receiving BOTOX®.  Bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infections (common colds) have been reported. Bronchitis was reported more frequently in people receiving BOTOX® for upper limb spasticity. Upper respiratory infections were also reported more frequently in people with prior breathing related problems with spasticity.  Tell your doctor about all your medical conditions, including if you: have or have had bleeding problems; have plans to have surgery; had surgery on your face; weakness of forehead muscles; trouble raising your eyebrows; drooping eyelids; any other abnormal facial change; are pregnant or plan to become pregnant (it is not known if BOTOX® can harm your unborn baby); are breastfeeding or plan to (it is not known if BOTOX® passes into breast milk).  Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Using BOTOX® with certain medicines may cause serious side effects. Do not start any new medicines until you have told your doctor that you received BOTOX® in the past.  Tell your doctor if you received any other botulinum toxin product in the last 4 months; have received injections of botulinum toxin such as Myobloc®, Dysport®, or Xeomin® in the past (tell your doctor exactly which product you received); have recently received an antibiotic injection; take muscle relaxants; take allergy or cold medicines; take sleep medicine; take aspirin-like products or blood thinners.  Other side effects of BOTOX® include: dry mouth, discomfort or pain at injection site, tiredness, headache, neck pain, eye problems: double vision, blurred vision, decreased eyesight, drooping eyelids, swelling of eyelids, dry eyes; and drooping eyebrows.

"Mar 06, 2019",Allergan Announces Phase 3 Results for Rapastinel as an Adjunctive Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD),", /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE: AGN) today announced topline results from three pivotal studies of rapastinel as an adjunctive treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). In three acute studies (RAP-MD-01,-02,-03), the rapastinel treatment arms did not differentiate from placebo on the primary and key secondary endpoints. In all three acute studies rapastinel was well tolerated without any signal of psychotomimetic side effects. In addition, an interim analysis of the rapastinel relapse prevention study (RAP-MD-04) suggests the primary and key secondary endpoints will not be met.  ""We are deeply disappointed with these results, and they are a vivid reminder that drug development is extremely challenging, especially in mental health. We are grateful to the patients, their caregivers, and the investigators who supported these clinical studies. We remain committed to the development of new life changing medications to combat the rising global toll of mental illness,"" said , at Allergan. ""We will evaluate the impact of these data on the ongoing monotherapy MDD program and suicidality in MDD study. We expect to make a decision on these programs during the course of 2019.""  ""As the number of deaths from suicide, alcohol and drugs continue to rise, it is clear that we need effective new approaches for mental illness. We thank for its long-standing commitment and investment in this important, yet difficult area,"" said MD, Professor of Clinical Psychiatry, , Managing Director, The Medical Research Network in .  These Phase 3 adjunctive MDD trials evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of rapastinel, compared to placebo, both in combination with antidepressant therapy (ADT) in patients with MDD who had a partial response to ADT. In all three pivotal clinical trials rapastinel was well tolerated and demonstrated a safety and tolerability profile similar to placebo.  Patients who completed the acute trials were eligible to enter the relapse prevention trial (RAP-MD-04). An interim analysis of (RAP-MD-04) was conducted of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints of all randomized patients in the double-blind treatment period. At the time of the analysis, all patients had completed all visits relevant for determining a relapse.  Detailed results from these studies will be presented at future scientific meetings.  Studies RAP-MD-01 (N= 457) and RAP-MD-03 (N= 415) were randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter, parallel group Phase 3 clinical trials conducted in , in which 450 mg of rapastinel or placebo were evaluated as an adjunctive treatment to an oral antidepressant in patients with MDD. Study medication was given once weekly as a bolus intravenous injection in addition to an oral ADT, to which the patient had experienced inadequate clinical response.  Study RAP-MD-02 (N= 638) was very similar in design, the main difference being the inclusion of a third treatment arm, in which a dose of 225 mg rapastinel was evaluated.  Patients who completed 3 weeks of double-blind treatment were eligible to enter the (RAP-MD-04) maintenance study, alternatively they were to be followed for 1 week in a safety follow-up period.  Eligible patients for study participation were 18 to 65 years of age and met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for MDD, with a current major depressive episode of at least 8 weeks and not exceeding 18 months in duration. In addition, eligible patients had experienced no more than partial response (< 50% improvement) to ongoing treatment with an ADT, administered at a stable and adequate (labeled) dose. Patients were required to continue their oral ADT throughout the entire study at a stable dose.  Rapastinel has recently been characterized as a modest and selective positive NMDA receptor modulator with a unique pharmacological mechanism of action fundamentally different from ketamine. In a series of preclinical experiments rapastinel directly enhanced NMDAR activity through a novel site independent of the glycine co-agonist site, and single doses resulted in rapid and sustained antidepressant effects as well as increased synaptic plasticity (Please see the full publication here: https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ijnp/pyy101/5244644 ). In a previously conducted Phase 2 clinical study rapastinel demonstrated a rapid onset of antidepressant effect within one day, which continued for approximately seven days after a single injection.  In addition to the adjunctive MDD program is conducting a global Phase 3 monotherapy program evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of rapastinel compared to placebo. These trials are actively recruiting patients.  is also conducting a Phase 2 proof of concept suicidality study evaluating efficacy, safety and tolerability of rapastinel, compared to placebo in addition to standard of care (SOC) of patients with MDD at imminent risk of suicide.  According to the (WHO) depression is a common disorder with currently 300 million people of all ages affected globally. The WHO lists depression as the leading cause of disability worldwide and as a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease, constituting the leading cause of disability worldwide. Approximately 16 million Americans are living with MDD, with 6.7 percent of U.S. adults reporting at least one MDD episode in the past year. MDD is the leading cause of disability in the U.S. for people between the ages of 15 and 44 and the primary reason why someone dies of suicide about every 12 minutes.

Actual results may differ materially from current expectations depending upon a number of factors affecting business. These factors include, among others, the difficulty of predicting the timing or outcome of approvals or actions, if any; the impact of competitive products and pricing; market acceptance of and continued demand for products; the impact of uncertainty around timing of generic entry related to key products, including RESTASIS®, on our financial results; risks associated with divestitures, acquisitions, mergers and joint ventures; risks related to impairments; uncertainty associated with financial projections, projected debt reduction, projected cost reductions, projected synergies, restructurings, increased costs, and adverse tax consequences; difficulties or delays in manufacturing; and other risks and uncertainties detailed in periodic public filings with the , including but not limited to Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended . Except as expressly required by law, disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements.  Non-GAAP performance net income per share is used by management as one of the primary metrics in evaluating the Company's performance. We believe that Non-GAAP performance net income per share enhances the comparability of our results between periods and provides additional information and transparency to investors on adjustments and other items that are not indicative of the Company's current and future operating performance. These are the financial measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make day to day operating decisions. We define non-GAAP adjustments to the reported GAAP measures as GAAP results adjusted for the following net of tax: (i) amortization expenses, (ii) global supply chain and operational excellence initiatives or other restructurings of a similar nature, (iii) acquisition, divestiture, integration and licensing charges, (iv) accretion and fair market value adjustments on contingent liabilities, (v) impairment/asset sales and related costs, including the exclusion of discontinued operations, (vi) legal settlements and (vii) other unusual charges or expenses. Non-GAAP performance net income per share is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for reported GAAP continuing operations loss per share. The Company has consistently excluded amortization and impairments of all intangible assets, including the product rights that generate a significant portion of our ongoing revenue. The Company's total accumulated amortization, including impairments of currently marketed products, related to our intangible assets as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $32.3 billion and $25.8 billion, respectively, and is expected to continue to be a material non-GAAP adjustment.

The non-GAAP effective tax rate in the three months ended December 31, 2018 was impacted by U.S. income taxed at rates higher than the Irish statutory rate, partially offset by income earned in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the Irish statutory rate. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2018 excludes a net discrete tax benefit of approximately $879.8 million related to the tax effects of integration and recognition of outside basis differences, changes in the applicable tax rates on certain temporary differences, uncertain tax positions, changes in valuation allowances and other individually insignificant items.

We define adjusted EBITDA as an amount equal to consolidated net income / (loss) from continuing operations attributable to shareholders for such period adjusted for the following: (i) interest expense, (ii) interest income, (iii) (benefit) for income taxes, (iv) depreciation and amortization expenses, (v) share-based compensation expense, (vi) asset impairment charges and losses / (gains) and expenses associated with the sale of assets, including the exclusion of discontinued operations, (vii) business restructuring charges associated with Allergan's global supply chain and operational excellence initiatives or other restructurings of a similar nature, (viii) costs and charges associated with the acquisition and divestitures of businesses and assets including, but not limited to, milestone payments, integration charges, other charges associated with the revaluation of assets or liabilities and charges associated with the revaluation of acquisition related contingent liabilities that are based in whole or in part on future estimated cash flows, (ix) litigation charges and settlements and (x) other unusual charges or expenses.

"Jan 07, 2019",Allergan Announces Positive 3-Month Topline Results from Second Phase 3 Study of Bimatoprost SR (Sustained-Release) Implant for Lowering Intraocular Pressure (IOP) in Patients with Open-Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension,", /PRNewswire/ -- , (NYSE: AGN), a leading global pharmaceutical company, today announced positive 3-month topline results from the second pivotal clinical trial of Bimatoprost SR, a first-in-class sustained-release, biodegradable implant for the reduction of IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Positive results from the first Phase 3 trial were reported in . Bimatoprost SR is designed to lower IOP for at least 4 months, achieving clinical goals while freeing patients from daily eye drop regimens. anticipates submitting a New Drug Application (NDA) to the in the second half of 2019. is also conducting Bimatoprost SR clinical trials for registration outside which are ongoing.  In this Phase 3 clinical study of 528 subjects with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, Bimatoprost SR reduced IOP by approximately 30 percent over the 12-week primary efficacy period, meeting the predefined criteria for non-inferiority to the study comparator, timolol. Results of this second Phase 3 study with an identical design as the first study, showed that the magnitude of IOP-lowering efficacy with Bimatoprost SR is similar to that observed with topical prostaglandin analogues.  ""The data results of intracameral Bimatoprost SR were consistently demonstrated in two pivotal trials, highlighting the sustained, predictable and potentially sight-saving benefits of this exciting new approach in treating patients with glaucoma,"" said , and Development Officer, Allergan.­ ""We are particularly encouraged by the long-term efficacy results leading to an extended treatment-free period.""  The study also showed the potential for the vast majority of patients to remain treatment free for at least 1 year after the last implant was inserted. Overall, Bimatoprost SR was well tolerated in the majority of patients. The 20-month masked study is ongoing, and additional data will become available as patients complete the study.  ""Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the world, making it essential to develop innovative new treatments and technologies that effectively address the underlying cause of the disease,"" said , Chief Commercial Officer, . ""Bimatoprost SR represents an entirely new treatment approach for glaucoma that delivers a trusted medication in a way that may transform treatment for the tens of millions of people around the world with glaucoma and ocular hypertension.""  ""Bimatoprost SR has the potential to be the first sustained-release option of a drop-free therapy for patients who are suffering from glaucoma. Proper use of eye drops continues to be a concern for eye care professionals,"" said , MD, Chief, at Bethesda, Vice Chair of Wilmer Practice Network and Associate Professor at . ""With the long duration of effect observed in this study, Bimatoprost SR can be a significant paradigm shift for the treatment of glaucoma.""  This multicenter, randomized, masked, parallel-group study in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension compares the efficacy and safety of 2 dose strengths of Bimatoprost SR to timolol eye drops used twice daily for up to 20 months. Patients were randomized to receive 3 administration cycles (Day 1, Week 16 and Week 32) of Bimatoprost SR or twice-daily timolol eye drops in the study eyes. Vehicle eye drops or sham administrations (Day 1, Week 16 and Week 32) were used in the study eyes for masking purposes. The topline results are reported at the prespecified primary analysis time, 12 weeks after the last patient received the first implant.  Glaucoma is one of the primary causes of irreversible vision loss and blindness. In 2018, nearly 130 million people were living with glaucoma globally. This number is expected to rise to an estimated 148 million by 2023. This progressive disease is characterized by elevated IOP. Uncontrolled, elevated IOP causes damage to the optic nerve and loss of vision. Reduction of elevated IOP is the only effective way to stop the progression and vision loss associated with glaucoma.  Current treatments to lower IOP include topical medications (eye drops), laser trabeculoplasty, minimally invasive glaucoma surgery and incisional surgery. Eye drop medications are the standard first-line treatment for glaucoma, but low patient adherence to these medications is common – up to 80 percent of patients are not using topical medications as prescribed. Patients often find it difficult to adhere to their eye drop regimen every day, year after year, because they forget to take doses, cannot afford medications, do not understand their disease, or have trouble instilling eye drops or sticking to the schedule. Poor adherence to topical medications relates directly to disease progression and vision loss. To remove long-term eye drop compliance as a factor in preserving vision, ophthalmologists rely on laser trabeculoplasty, MIGS and more invasive incisional surgeries and await the development of sustained-release medication.

"Jan 03, 2019",New Data Published in the International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology Support that Rapastinel May Produce Rapid and Sustained Antidepressant Effects Through a Potentially Novel Mechanism of Action,", /PRNewswire/ -- plc (NYSE: AGN) today announced new pharmacology research for its investigational compound rapastinel, which is currently being studied in Phase 3 trials for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Published in the , the preclinical research supports that rapastinel exhibited rapid and sustained antidepressant effects through positive modulation of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor and suggests that it may work differently from NMDA receptor antagonists like ketamine and S-ketamine (esketamine).  ""Depression treatments for the past 40 years have involved medications affecting the level of monoamines in the brain — serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Rapastinel works on the glutamate system representing a completely different mechanistic approach. Our research found that rapastinel acts through a novel site within the NMDA receptor to enhance NMDA receptor function, providing a mechanism of action to explain both the rapid-acting antidepressant effects and a low propensity for dissociative and other psychotomimetic side effects,"" said , VP of Research Pharmacology at and lead author of the study. ""We believe rapastinel represents a potentially novel pharmacological approach to treating major depressive disorder.""  Glutamate is the most prominent excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, research suggests that dysfunction of the glutamatergic system may play a role in the neurobiology of MDD. The NMDA receptor is one of the glutamatergic receptors in the brain, and plays a critical role in learning, memory, and the strength of synaptic communication. The current research suggests that rapastinel may help relieve depression by enhancing NMDA receptor function.  Please see the full publication here: https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ijnp/pyy101/5244644  About Rapastinel   Rapastinel is positive NMDA receptor modulator that demonstrated a rapid onset of antidepressant effect within one day that was sustained for an average of seven days after a single injection in a Phase 2 clinical study. Rapastinel is currently being evaluated as a once weekly, bolus intravenous (IV) injection in adjunctive and monotherapy MDD in Phase 3 clinical studies. Rapastinel is also being evaluated in MDD patients at imminent risk of suicide in a phase 2 proof of concept study.  About MDD   Approximately 16 million Americans are living with MDD, with 6.7 percent of U.S. adults reporting at least one MDD episode in the past year. MDD is the leading cause of disability in the U.S. for people between the ages of 15 and 44 and the primary reason why someone dies of suicide about every 12 minutes.  There remains a significant unmet need in treating MDD. Upwards of 70 percent of patients with MDD are partial or non-responders to first-line therapies, which include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). In addition, current antidepressants can take up to 6-8 weeks to produce a clinically-relevant response, with tolerability issues leading to early discontinuation for many patients. Patients with an inadequate response to current therapies may continue to experience significant depressive symptoms, which can include suicidal ideation in patients with severe, recurrent, or chronic depression. In the U.S. alone, treatment resistant depression costs annually in direct health care and indirect work loss-related costs, accounting for a large share of the MDD economic burden.
