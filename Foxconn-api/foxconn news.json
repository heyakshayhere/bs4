After eight months of research and development, those lines successfully reduced the manpower resources required for defect inpsection by 50 percent. The new technology will also be applied to broader manufacturing uses for verticals such as textiles and healthcare, as part of Foxconn\u2019s support for accelerating transformation of a range of industry sectors.\u00a0\nFigure: The automated production line applied for FOXCONN NxVAE.\nNew technology transforming the production line defect inspection process\nDefect inspection\u00a0during the production process is an important step to ensuring\u00a0product quality. Traditionally, Computer Vision technology is used in defect inspection and that technology identifies defects by recognizing and defining a \u201cGolden Sample\u201d - a perfect product sample - and comparing each product with that sample. The \u201cGolden Sample\u201d comparison, however, varies when it is placed in different manufacturing locations. Slight changes, such as the difference of light sources and the positioning of the DUT, Device Under Test, sample, can result in a comparison failure and that is why there is a need for additional manpower for secondary detection. Supervised learning (deep learning) technology is being increasingly used to enhance the efficiency of this process. The machine learning algorithms are taught to distinguish defects through data\u00a0labelling, training and inferencing. However, that requires the use of high resolution defect visuals for the machine learning process and that can be time consuming and hard to collect given the high-quality production standards within Foxconn.\u00a0\nFOXCONN NxVAE, with unsupervised learning AI at its core, addresses the above challenges and brings unprecedented benefits to smart manufacturing. The unsupervised learning algorithms in the new solutions can identify products with defects by simply analyzing and clustering unlabeled data from a good product sample without the need for human intervention. The technology, and its increased ability to discover differences in data received, ensures that the inspection process is significantly enhanced, and manual checking becomes unnecessary. Moreover, its self-learning ability does not require collecting, categorizing, and labelling each of the detect visuals thus allowing for a more significant buffer in the usually tight production timeline. FOXCONN NxVAE has the ability to detect the 13 most common types of defects accurately without any errors.\u00a0\nContinual investment and innovation of AI solutions\u00a0\nThe vision at Foxconn is to pave the way for next-generation AI solutions. The company has deployed several in-house-developed AI solutions on a number of different production lines, leading to an improvement in reporting accuracy from 95% to 99% and a reduction of at least one third of the operating costs for appearance defect inspection projects. The company\u2019s vision is also reflected in the recent launch of \u201cBOXiedge\u2122\u201d, the next-generation AI processing solution for video analytics. That solution provides market-leading energy efficiency for standalone AI inference nodes, benefiting applications including smart cities, smart medical, and industrial IoT. In the future, FOXCONN NxVAE will also be applied and integrated into \u201cBOXiedge\u2122\u201d solutions.\u00a0\n\u201cThe yield rate of our production lines has exceeded 99% and the unsupervised learning algorithm developed by the AI team not only enhances efficiency and reduces the challenges associated with introducing new products into the production line, it also marks an important production efficiency milestone for our industry,\u201d said Gene Liu, Vice President of the Semiconductor Subgroup at Foxconn Technology Group. \u201cThis development also demonstrates our company\u2019s vision of \u201c3+3=\u221e\u201d which symbolizes the infinite possibilities created by Foxconn\u2019s industrial advancement and emerging technologies, and we remain committed to investing in these areas.\u201d\u00a0\nFor more information, please contact: Max Deng (max.cm.deng@foxconn.com).\u00a0\nFOXCONN NxVAE Product Information: https:\/\/nxai.com.tw\/nxvae-unsupervised-learning-en\/\u00a0","66":"18 January 2021, Taipei \u2013 MIH Open Platform Alliance (MIH Alliance) announced that Mr. Jack Cheng is appointed Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. William Wei, Chief Technology Officer of Foxconn Technology Group, will be leading the software development of MIH Open Platform.\u00a0\nThe mission of MIH Open Platform Alliance is to facilitate cooperation in the electric vehicle sector, developing the new technologies, establish testing and certification standards, and to bring alliance members together, with their complementary expertise to achieve the goal of cost reduction and expedition of development cycles.
