"May 19, 2022",Astellas Analysis Shows No Evidence of Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Events or Mortality with Roxadustat Compared with Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESAs) at 59th ERA Congress 2022,"Pooled Phase 3 data for anemia of CKD patients, incident dialysis or not receiving dialysis from the ALPINE Phase 3 clinical trial programTOKYO, May 19, 2022 – Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., “Astellas”) today announced results from a pooled analysis of patients with symptomatic anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) and incident dialysis-dependent (IDD) from four Phase 3 studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of EVRENZO™ (roxadustat). These data presented during a mini-oral session at the 59th European Renal Association (ERA) Congress, taking place between May 19–22, 2022, showed no evidence of an increased risk of cardiovascular events or mortality with roxadustat compared with standard of care, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs).Roxadustat was non-inferior to ESA for risk of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.61, 1.02) and a major adverse cardiovascular event plus congestive heart failure or unstable angina requiring hospitalization (MACE+) (95% CI: 0.62, 0.98) with a consistent finding for all-cause mortality (ACM) (95% CI: 0.57, 1.05). Hazard ratios for MACE, MACE+ and ACM vs ESA were 0.79, 0.78 and 0.78, respectively, favoring roxadustat. Although treatment-emergent adverse events occurred commonly in both the roxadustat and ESA groups, patients rarely discontinued either study drug because of an adverse event.“I’ve seen first-hand the effect anemia can have on those living with CKD, and it impacts almost every aspect of their daily lives,” said Professor Jonathan Barratt, Ph.D., FRCP, Consultant Nephrologist at the University of Leicester, United Kingdom. “I’m pleased to present these data which demonstrate that, as an alternative oral treatment that controls anemia with a reduced need for IV iron compared to standard of care, roxadustat has the potential to alleviate the burden many living with this condition have – with no risk of increase in cardiovascular events or mortality when compared with the existing standard of care.”As a first-in-class orally administered inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH), roxadustat increases hemoglobin levels with a mechanism of action that is different from that of ESAs. Roxadustat activates the body’s natural protective response to reduced oxygen levels in the blood. This response involves the regulation of multiple, complementary processes that promote a coordinated erythropoietic response and increase the blood’s oxygen-carrying capacity.“Astellas is dedicated to addressing unmet medical needs and providing innovative solutions in nephrology,” said Ahsan Arozullah, Senior Vice President and Head of Development Therapeutic Areas, Astellas. “These data presented today add to the extensive clinical evidence available for roxadustat and provide further assurance to the nephrology community of the positive impact roxadustat can have for patients with symptomatic anemia associated with CKD.”Additional Astellas mini-oral presentations at the 59th ERA Congress 2022 include:Title: Cardiovascular Safety of Roxadustat Versus Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents for Treatment of Anemia in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease Incident to or Not Receiving Dialysis: Pooled subgroup Analysis of Four Phase 3 Studies (Abstract 2379)Presenter: Jonathan Barratt, University of Leicester, United KingdomTitle: Iron Parameters in Patients Treated With Roxadustat for Anemia Associated With Chronic Kidney Disease: Post Hoc Analysis of the Non-Dialysis-Dependent or Incident Dialysis Population From Four Phase 3 Studies (Abstract 1008)Presenter: Luca De Nicola, University of Campania, Naples, Italy Click below for a copy of the full press releaseFollow us on social media",https://www.astellas.com/en/news/25831,https://www.astellas.com/system/files/2017-01/global.png,Astellas

(TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., “Astellas”) announced the presentation of new roxadustat data at the 59th European Renal Association (ERA) Congress, taking place May 19–22, 2022. Two presentations focus on pooled analyses from the comprehensive ALPINE Phase 3 clinical trial program, reinforcing the overall safety profile of roxadustat with further details on cardiovascular safety. Both compare roxadustat with current standard of care, erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs), for patients with symptomatic anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not receiving dialysis or just starting dialysis (incident dialysis). An evaluation of iron metabolism parameters and its clinical implications in patients with anemia of CKD in a similar population will also be presented.  “At Astellas, we strive to improve outcomes for patients most in need of innovative new treatments,” said Ahsan Arozullah, Senior Vice President and Head of Development Therapeutic Areas, Astellas. “The clinical research being presented at the ERA Congress further validates the safety and efficacy profile of roxadustat as a new treatment option for those living with anemia of CKD and demonstrates Astellas’ continued commitment to this community of patients.”   Mini-Oral Presentations Presentations and abstracts are available online starting Thursday, May 19, 2022, at 8:00 a.m. CEST, when all prerecorded presentations are published on the congress platform.

Details of the Plan   (1)  Overview of the Plan   The Plan is an incentive plan, under which delivery of the Company’s shares will  be conducted during the three-year period from the fiscal year ending March 31,  2023 to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 (“Applicable Period”), based on the  level of growth of enterprise and shareholder value, etc.  The Company intends to continue implementing incentive plans which are similar  to the Plan in each year in and after the following fiscal year by establishing new  BIP Trusts, or by making changes or additional entrustments to the existing BIP  Trusts that have expired. The details of incentive plans put into effect next fiscal  year or later shall be determined at the appropriate time by resolution of the Board  of Directors.   (2)   Individuals eligible under the Plan (Beneficiary Conditions)   The Directors who are in office as of July 1, 2022 (“Eligible Individuals”) will, in  principle, receive delivery of a certain number of the Company’s shares based on  the points provided for below in (4) subject to the condition that the Beneficiary  Conditions set forth below are satisfied.   3       The Beneficiary Conditions are as follows:   1)  Such person shall continue to serve as the Director until June 1, 2025;   2)  Such person shall have met other criteria which are deemed necessary for   achieving the purpose of the stock compensation scheme.   (3)  Trust period   The  trust  period  shall  be  from  May  18,  2022  (planned)  to  August  31,  2025  (planned).  At the expiration of the trust period, the Company may continue the Trust in the  form of incentive plans which are similar to the Plan by making changes to the  trust agreements and making additional entrustments.   (4)  Number of the Company’s shares to be delivered to Eligible Individuals   The  number  of  the  Company’s  shares  to  be  delivered  to  Eligible  Individuals  (including  the  number  of  the  Company’s  shares  to  be  converted  into  cash  in  accordance with (5) below) shall be determined on the basis of the points, which  have been allocated in accordance with the following, with 1 point corresponding  to 1 share of the Company’s share (*2).   (*2)   In the event that the number of the Company’s shares belonging to the Trust increases or   decreases due to stock split, gratis allotment or stock consolidation, etc., the number of the   Company’s  shares  to  be  delivered  per  point  shall  be  adjusted  by  means  of  a  reasonable   method.   Basic points shall be allocated to the Eligible Individuals who are in office as of  July 1, 2022 in accordance with the following formula.   (Formula for the calculation of basic points)   Basic amount (*3) determined based on rank divided by the Average closing price  of the Company’s shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in March 2022   * Any fractions of less than one shall be discarded.   (*3)  The  basic  amount levels  shall  be set appropriately  in  accordance  with  responsibilities  and   other  factors in  reference  particularly  to  objective  remuneration survey data  of an  external   expert  organization  in  order  to  ensure  competitive  remuneration  levels  that  enable  the   Company to recruit and retain talents.   Eligible Individuals who are in office as of June 1, 2025 will receive delivery of the  Company’s  shares  from  the  Trust  in  numbers  corresponding  to  the  points  calculated according to the formula below.   Basic points × Performance-linked coefficient (*4)   * Any fractions of less than one shall be discarded.   4     (*4)  The performance-linked coefficient of the Plan shall be determined within a range from 0% to   200% based on results of comparing the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR*”) during   the applicable period, against both the growth rate of Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) and   the TSR of global pharmaceutical companies (“TSR Peer Group”). The list of the TSR Peer   Group shall be proposed to the Board of Directors after deliberation by the Compensation   Committee, and accordingly determined by June 30, 2022.  * TSR refers to shareholders’ total return on investment, encompassing both capital gains and   dividends.   (5)  Method and timing for delivering the Company’s shares to the Directors   “Delivery of the Company’s shares” refers to, at a given time, the receipt of half of  the number of the Company’s shares corresponding to the allocated points from  the  Trust  (provided that shares less  than  one  unit  shall  be  converted  into cash  within  the  Trust  and  the  cash  equivalent  to  the  amount  of  conversion  will  be  received),  and  the  receipt  of  the  cash  equivalent  to  the  remaining  half  after  conversion into cash within the Trust.   Eligible Individuals who have met the Beneficiary Conditions will receive delivery  of the Company’s shares around June 2025.   In the  event that  an  Eligible Individual  retires  during  the  trust  period  (excluding  voluntary retirement and dismissal), as a general rule, such individual will receive  the delivery of the Company’s shares in numbers corresponding to the points that  have been allocated up to the time of retirement.   In the event that an Eligible Individual becomes deceased during the trust period,  as a general rule, the Company’s shares shall be converted into cash in numbers  corresponding to the points which have been allocated to such individual up to  that time within the Trust, and the cash equivalent to the amount of conversion  will be received by such individual’s heir from the Trust.   (6)  Amount expected to be entrusted to the Trust and the number of the Company’s  shares  expected  to  be  delivered  from  the  Trust  (including  the  number  of  the  Company’s shares to be converted into cash in accordance with (5) above).   The Company intends to entrust ¥610 million to the Trust (*5).   (*5)  Equivalent to the total amount of stock purchases, trust fees and trust expenses during the   trust period, and inclusive of the  residual assets succeeded from the existing BIP Trust. At   the  14th  Term  Annual  Shareholders  Meeting,  it  was  approved  and  resolved  the  maximum   amount of contribution to the Scheme to be ¥1,640 million per fiscal year, and the amount to   be entrusted by the Company to BIP Trust in each fiscal year shall be within the amount thus   resolved.   The  maximum  number  of  the  Company’s  shares  to  be  delivered  by  the  Trust  during the trust period in accordance with (4) above shall be the number derived  by  dividing  maximum  amount  of  ¥1,640  million  entrusted  to  the  Trust  by  the   5     average closing price of the Company’s shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in  March 2022.   (7)  Method for acquiring the Company’s shares by the Trust   The acquisition of the Company’s shares by the Trust is planned to be made on  the stock market.   (8)  Exercise of voting rights of the Company’s shares within the Trust   In order to maintain a neutral position vis-a-vis management, no voting rights shall  be exercised on the Company’s shares within the Trust during the trust period.   (9)  Handling of dividends on the Company’s shares within the Trust   Dividends on the Company’s shares within the Trust shall be received by the Trust  and applied to trust fees and trust expenses for the Trust.   (10) Handling at the expiration of the trust period   In the event that residual shares remain at the expiration of the trust period due to  factors  such  as  the  extent  to  which  enterprise  and  shareholder  value  have  achieved  growth  during  the  applicable  period,  the  Company  may  continue  the  Trust  in  the  form  of  incentive  plans  which  are  similar  to  the  Plan  by  making  changes to the trust agreement and additional entrustments. If the Trust is to be  terminated due to the expiration of the trust period, gratis transfer of these residual  shares will be made from the Trust to the Company, and the Company plans to  implement the cancellation of them by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Additionally, in the event that residual dividends on the Company’s shares within  the Trust remain at the expiration of the trust period and the Company continues  to use the Trust, such residual assets shall be applied towards the acquisition of  shares. However, if the Company concludes the Trust due to the expiration of the  trust period, such assets are planned to be donated to an organization having no  relationship of interest with the Company or Directors and Corporate Executives  of the Company.   6     (Reference)   [Contents of the Trust for the Incentive Plan in fiscal year 2022]   1) Trust category   Monetary trust other than a specific individually operated   monetary trust (third-party benefit trust)   2) Trust objective   To provide incentive to the Directors   3) Settlor   The Company   4) Trustee   Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation (planned)  (Joint Trustee: The Master Trust Bank of Japan, Ltd.)   5) Beneficiaries   The Directors who have satisfied the Beneficiary Conditions   6) Trust   administrator   7) Date of trust  agreement   Third party with no relationship of interest with the Company  (certified public accountant)   May 18, 2022 (planned)   8) Trust period   May 18, 2022 (planned) to August 31, 2025 (planned)   9) Start of the Plan   July 1, 2022 (planned)   10) Exercise of  voting rights   Not to be exercised   11) Type of shares   to be acquired  Common stock of the Company   12) Amount of   entrustment   ¥610 million (planned)  (Including trust fees and trust expenses) (*6)   13) Acquisition   period of shares  May 20, 2022 (planned) to June 30, 2022 (planned)   14) Method of   acquiring shares  Acquisition on the stock market   15) Rights holder   The Company   16) Residual assets   The Company, the rights holder, will receive residual assets  within the scope of the reserve fund for trust expenses after  deductions of stock purchases from trust money.

"May 09, 2022",We published a story: “Astellas DX Strategy Series Vol.1: Utilizing DX to Create and Maximize VALUE for Patients.”,"The pharmaceutical industry handles vast amounts of data throughout its entire value chain, from drug discovery (research), development, and manufacturing, to sales and the post-marketing maximization of our product value. Consulting firms have estimated that digital transformation (DX) will have a huge role to play in the information-intensive pharma industry. Conscious of the profound impact DX will have on the company's future, Astellas has selected DX as one of its critical enablers to create and deliver VALUE for patients and is driving forward initiatives on a global scale. Consultants analyzing the potential impact of DX on the pharmaceutical industry have highlighted huge benefits for drug R&D over the next 15 to20 years. These include the possibility of a 60% reduction in cost and a shortened timeframe of approximately 2.4 years*1 in drug research & development.*Source: “Paradigm of New Drug Discovery through Technology Advance” (Deloitte Tohmatsu Consulting LLC) “With advances in (digital) technology, (omitted) it will be possible, 15 to 20 years from now, to reduce the cost of pharmaceutical research and development by about 60% and shorten the development period by about 2.4 years.” https://www2.deloitte.com/jp/ja/pages/life-sciences-and-healthcare/articles/ls/brnp-v1.htmlIn today’s increasingly globalized marketplace, we currently conduct business in more than 70 countries worldwide. In this environment, we operate almost all aspects of our drug discovery (research), development, manufacturing, sales, and corporate operations as function-based organizations. Our DX initiatives are executed as global projects to achieve results that will significantly impact our entire group. Astellas' approach to DX is much more than just streamlining operations through digital technology. We have positioned DX as one of the critical enablers, accelerating our Corporate Strategic Plan 2021's execution, to realize our VISION: To be on the forefront of healthcare change to turn innovative science into VALUE for patients.While pharmaceutical prescriptions (Rx) will always remain a core element of our business, we are committed to providing further VALUE to patients throughout the entire patient journey. Our Rx+® business integrates innovative medical technologies with cutting-edge technologies in different fields to develop solutions across the whole spectrum of medical care—including diagnosis, prevention, therapeutic and prognostic care. DX plays a crucial role in this Rx+® business. Click here to learn more.By striving to implement DX across all areas of the value chain—including R&D, manufacturing, sales, and our Rx+® business—we are proactively developing solutions that maximize patient outcomes and reduce costs across the healthcare industry.Astellas’ definition of VALUE is detailed in the below graphic. Click here to learn more.  *Adapted from “What Is Value in HealthCare?” Porter, M.E. (2010). New England Journal of Medicine  Astellas' DX Vision is to ""become a world-class Intelligent Enterprise that accelerates digital transformation to turn innovative science to VALUE for patients."" We have identified four levers (sources of value) centered around Digital x Data to realize our DX vision.Sense (Use sensory devices to collect various types of events as data) Analyze (Utilize and analyze all data to forecast the future and support bold and accurate decision-making early on) Automate (Use digital for high quality, fast operations) Engage (Use a combination of digital and analogue to connect people across time and space)By combining these four levers with our company's accumulated knowledge of science, we believe we will achieve superior pharmaceutical R&D and acquire competitive superiority.The type of DX we aspire to implement at Astellas is not one where technology replaces our people. Instead, it is one where digital technology works alongside our employees, complementing each other in areas of mutual strength. For example, digital technologies such as AI and robots will be responsible for collecting and analyzing necessary data and engaging in repetitive tasks. Experts in their respective fields would then take over, utilizing this data to spark ideas that only the human brain is capable of, and inspiring shifts and directional decisions based on strong volition. In other words, our goal is to create an environment in which every employee can play an active role to the fullest for the benefit of patients. Astellas' Information Systems division promotes business transform by introducing IT and digital technologies to existing operations in the prescription drug (Rx) business. It engages in the continuous renewal of our digital infrastructure, including communication and data utilization.Alongside our Information Systems division is AIA—the Advanced Informatics & Analytics division. This team of data analysis experts conducts and promotes sophisticated data analysis and utilization of AI, machine learning, and other advanced digital capabilities. These two divisions play a central role in advancing DX at the company-wide level in cooperation with other divisions.  ""For me, DX is about evolving the way we conduct business; it's about utilizing digital technology to dramatically increase VALUE for patients. Even if we introduce a small system, it is an excellent example of DX if it leads to increased patient VALUE. Conversely, if we decide to work with cutting-edge technology or use an extensive system, we can't call it DX if it does not evolve the way our business is done and lead to increased VALUE. In 2018, Astellas established a core team for driving forward DX in the three divisions of Corporate Strategy, AIA, and Information Systems. We have expanded the core team across divisions and are pushing forward DX projects across the value chain. We encourage all our employees, whatever project they are engaged with, to channel their passion for delivering as much patient VALUE as possible as quickly as possible by utilizing DX.""  Employees in all Astellas’ business areas are working together to drive forward DX. Among our wide range of initiatives, we would like to highlight a series of efforts that represent our DX vision.

"May 06, 2022",Astellas to Present 12-Week Data from Pivotal Phase 3 SKYLIGHT 1™ Trial of Fezolinetant in Oral Session at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Annual Meeting,"Astellas’ investigational nonhormonal treatment meets all primary endpoints, significantly reducing the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopauseTOKYO, May 6, 2022 – Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Kenji Yasukawa, Ph.D., “Astellas”) will present 12-week results from the pivotal Phase 3 SKYLIGHT 1™ clinical trial examining the efficacy and safety of fezolinetant, an investigational oral, nonhormonal compound being studied for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause (VMS), on Sunday, May 8, 2022 at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Annual Clinical and Scientific Meeting in San Diego. VMS, characterized by hot flashes (also called hot flushes) and/or night sweats, are common symptoms of menopause.1,2 Findings showed the SKYLIGHT 1 trial of fezolinetant 30 mg and 45 mg administered once daily met all four co-primary endpoints, demonstrating a statistically significant reduction from baseline in the frequency and severity of moderate to severe VMS at weeks 4 and 12 versus placebo. The safety profile of fezolinetant in SKYLIGHT 1 is aligned with what was previously observed with fezolinetant.3Fezolinetant is an investigational nonhormonal selective neurokinin 3 (NK3) receptor antagonist that blocks a specific receptor in the temperature control center of the brain (the hypothalamus) to reduce the frequency and severity of moderate to severe VMS associated with menopause.4,5,6,7   “These data are encouraging since menopause-related VMS, which affect more than 50% of women 40 to 64 years of age, can adversely impact daily quality of life,” said Genevieve Neal-Perry, M.D., Ph.D., Chair, UNC School of Medicine Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. “The SKYLIGHT 1 results demonstrate the potential of fezolinetant to reduce the frequency and severity of moderate to severe VMS, which represent some of the most bothersome menopause symptoms.”For the co-primary endpoint of reduction in daily (24 hours) mean frequency of moderate to severe VMS versus placebo, fezolinetant 30 mg demonstrated a -1.87 (p<0.001) and -2.39 (p<0.001) mean change at weeks 4 and 12, respectively. At the 45 mg dose, fezolinetant showed a -2.07 (p<0.001) and -2.55 (p<0.001) mean change at weeks 4 and 12, respectively. Additionally, for the co-primary endpoint of reduction in daily (24 hours) mean severity of moderate to severe VMS versus placebo, fezolinetant 30 mg demonstrated a -0.15 (p=0.012) and -0.24 (p=0.002) mean change at weeks 4 and 12, respectively. The 45 mg dose of fezolinetant showed a -0.19 (p=0.002) and -0.20 (p=0.007) mean change versus placebo at weeks 4 and 12, respectively.Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 37.4%, 43.4% and 44.6% of individuals in the SKYLIGHT 1 trial in the 30 mg, 45 mg and placebo groups, respectively. Headache was the most common TEAE in the fezolinetant groups and was reported by 5.2%, 6.4% and 7.4% in the 30 mg, 45 mg and placebo groups, respectively. Serious TEAEs occurred in less than 2% of patients in the fezolinetant groups.“The 12-week results of the SKYLIGHT 1 study add to the growing body of evidence supporting the potential clinical benefit of fezolinetant in women who experience moderate to severe hot flashes as part of menopause,” said Nancy Martin, M.D., PharmD, Vice President, Global Medical Head, Medical Specialties, Astellas. “Our clinical program reflects Astellas' deep commitment to research and advancing science in areas of unmet need, including women's health.""The safety and efficacy of fezolinetant are under investigation and have not been established. If approved by regulatory authorities, fezolinetant would be a first-in-class, nonhormonal treatment option to reduce the frequency and severity of moderate to severe VMS associated with menopause.
