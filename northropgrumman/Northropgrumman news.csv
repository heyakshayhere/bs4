The showcase, presented by Northrop Grumman, in collaboration with Bondi Partners, provides small and medium-sized Australian companies an opportunity to pitch their innovations in advanced autonomous technology, payload development and digital enterprise solutions to win an opportunity to enter a 12-month mentorship program with Northrop Grumman. This year’s showcase winners are Vai Photonics, Fortifyedge and Nominal Systems.  “The showcase is an excellent platform for Australian SMEs to demonstrate the advanced technologies this nation is capable of developing and exporting globally, as well as delivering to our Australian Defence Force and its allies,” said Christine Zeitz, general manager, Northrop Grumman Asia Pacific. “Northrop Grumman Australia is proudly committed to building and supporting Australian businesses to boost Australia’s sovereign defence industry capability.”  The winners of the showcase create a range of technologies that have been developed in Australia and will be part of building the next generation of Australian Defence systems.  Vai Photonics developed a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor that measures vehicle velocity and combines that data with navigational systems to enable accurate navigation in environments where the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is not available or accessible.  Fortifyedge developed a software platform powered by tiny machine learning (small data size machine learning programs) that can manage next-generation wearables and smart devices war fighters will use in action. Users will be able to verify their identity and unlock secure devices without removing protective equipment, such as gloves and goggles.  Nominal Systems created a digital engineering platform that allows users to build complex simulations of their systems that can streamline design, testing, and operation processes. This platform provides a new dimension of mission support for space operations by enabling stress testing (through simulations) and intelligence/data integration into modern space systems.  Through the showcase mentoring program, Northrop Grumman and Bondi Partners will now offer these innovative companies mentorship and guidance on working within the Australian and U.S. Defence industries, commercialization opportunities, engagement with government, and strategic communications, among other topics. The mentorship programs are tailored to individual company needs.  Northrop Grumman is a technology company, focused on global security and human discovery.

Dennis Monagle, U.S. Navy. “While Fire Scout will still be active on remaining littoral combat ships, the system is being built into the Constellation-class frigate design, most notably the USS Constellation (FFG-62), as well as other ship classes.”  MQ-8C Fire Scout continues to deploy on littoral combat ships with future deployments planned on Constellation-class guided-missile frigates and operations from shore sites under the Expeditionary Advance Base Operations concept, including potential logistics cargo role. Other potential future roles for the MQ-8C include mine countermeasures and anti-submarine warfare.  “The MQ-8C Fire Scout’s initial deployment was aboard USS Milwaukee (LCS-5) in the Caribbean Sea,” said Lance Eischeid, director, Fire Scout program, Northrop Grumman. “MQ-8C Fire Scout provided increased maritime intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and targeting (ISR&T) capability that contributed greatly to the success of the U.S. Navy’s counter-narcotics operations.”  In addition to providing critical decision-making, MQ-8C Fire Scout is supporting advanced capabilities including demonstrating manned-unmanned teaming (MUMT), enabling sensor information sharing across a distributed force, further increasing survivability, reducing risk to and burden on manned aircraft, and enhancing weapons capacity. Fire Scout is furthering the successful integration of unmanned platforms and manned assets at sea.  With Fire Scout’s ability to operate at extended ranges required for future warfighting activities, the autonomous helicopter system provides responsive, reliable, and real-time surveillance capabilities and operates from both air-capable ships and developed or austere landing zones.

FAAD C2 used the Universal Command and Control (UC2) interface to successfully demonstrate joint interoperability using UC2 in a counter-unmanned aircraft system (C-UAS) context.  “FAAD C2 is a battle-proven, fielded and trusted system, constantly evolving to meet the warfighter’s needs,” said Christine Harbison, vice president and general manager, combat systems and mission readiness, Northrop Grumman. “The system’s open, multi-domain architecture allows for easy and rapid integration of sensors and effectors from across the joint force, which made it the ideal choice for this JADC2 demonstration.”  UC2 is part of a U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) initiative to create a universal language to be used across the services. During Purple Guardian, assets from multiple services implemented UC2 messaging for C-UAS missions. FAAD C2 performed all battle manager roles for all services during the live-fire events. FAAD C2 correlated tracks of incoming threats using multiple service sensors to create a single integrated air picture, send engagement orders, and provide joint situational awareness and command and control.  The DOD selected FAAD C2 as the C2 system for counter-small unmanned aerial system procurements. FAAD C2 is deployed in several theaters of operation for short range air defense, C-UAS and counter-rocket, artillery and mortar missions.

Global and Australian leaders in space communications — Northrop Grumman, Inmarsat, L3Harris, AECOM, Blacktree Technology, EM Solutions and Vocus — will draw on decades of collective experience to invest in and grow an Australian sovereign satellite communications capability, increase resiliency of military satellite communications for the future battlespace and create jobs across Australia.  “The Northrop Grumman Australia team brings together technologies and capabilities that will significantly increase Australia’s sovereign space capability,” said Christine Zeitz, general manager, Northrop Grumman Asia Pacific. “Building on proven experience, our team is developing an industry leading solution to support critical and complex missions for Australia’s next generation space programs.”  Northrop Grumman will integrate its high capacity and high mobility satellites through a flexible, scalable and agile growth architecture, and provide sustainment of the mission system including through the state-of-the-art Parallax Labs facility opened in Australia during 2021. Combined with sovereign, on-demand access to the Inmarsat Global Express satellites, the Australian Defence Force will gain the capability to assign sovereign capacity and coverage immediately as the mission requires.  AECOM’s support will include designing Satellite Ground Stations and Satellite Operations Centres, while L3 Harris will manufacture Wombat terminals locally. This will boost sovereign manufacturing and technical know-how for a sovereign satellite industry in Australia to create up to 100 additional jobs for supporting small to medium enterprises.  Blacktree Technology will leverage 20 years of Australian know-how to provide the High Mobility UHF ground segment to the solution offering, with Australian design and manufacturing company EM Solutions on board to offer certification services to the team.

Enabled by Northrop Grumman cryocooler technology, the system has cooled the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) to its operational cryogenic temperature, a critical step toward first science.  “Reaching MIRI’s operational temperature is a major step toward science and all the astounding discoveries Webb will uncover for years to come,” said Charlie Atkinson, chief engineer, James Webb Space Telescope, Northrop Grumman. “The success of this remarkable milestone is a testament to the dedication of engineers and scientists and the many years of practice.”  Webb’s cryocooler is an advanced machine that operates as an internal refrigerator to establish and maintain the right cryogenic temperature for the MIRI. The cryocooler keeps sensors extremely cold so the MIRI can observe the skies and capture light from billions of years ago. To date, Northrop Grumman has delivered over 50 space flight cryocoolers with an accumulated 300 years of combined on-orbit operations.  Webb’s suite of scientific instruments, MIRI included, spent the last three months passively cooling off in deep space to 90 kelvin – minus 298 Fahrenheit or minus 183 Celsius – with the help of Webb’s giant sunshield . The size of a tennis court, the sunshield protects the telescope from light and heat emitted from the sun, Earth and moon, and the observatory itself. Last week, Webb’s MIRI reached its operating cryogenic temperature of below seven kelvin, which is minus 448 Fahrenheit or minus 266 Celsius.  Taking Webb from the drawing board and making it a reality was an enormous collaborative effort between NASA, international partners, and industry. As the largest, most complex and powerful space telescope ever built, Webb required 10 technological inventions, including revolutionary optics, detectors and MIRI’s advanced cryocooler.

The 17-foot-tall abort motor is one of three motors comprising the LAS that sits atop the Orion spacecraft aboard NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and is designed to increase astronaut safety on the pad and through initial ascent.  Approximately 250 measurement channels assessed the abort motor as the four exhaust nozzles pointing skyward produced nearly 400,000 pounds of thrust over its two-second firing time. Today’s test concludes the verification of a new insulation formulation and completes qualification testing for the Orion’s LAS.  “This impressive, high-impulse motor burns three times faster than a typical motor of this size, and if needed, the reverse-flow nozzles pull the crew capsule away from the launch vehicle and to safety,” said Wendy Williams, vice president, propulsion systems, Northrop Grumman. “Together, the three solid rocket motors of the LAS equip the SLS with the highest human-rated thrust and acceleration safety system possible.”  The first active LAS system will be integrated into the Orion spacecraft for Artemis II, the first crewed flight of SLS.  Northrop Grumman also produces the attitude control motor (ACM) to directionally control the LAS. The ACM orients the crew capsule for parachute deployment and is manufactured at Northrop Grumman’s Elkton, Maryland, facility.  The company further supports NASA’s Artemis program producing the twin solid rocket boosters for the SLS rocket and was recently awarded a contract to support Artemis missions with flight sets through 2031. Northrop Grumman is also providing the Habitation and Logistics Outpost module for NASA’s Lunar Gateway and internally developing a Lunar Terrain Vehicle that supports human and robotic exploration of the Moon and beyond.

"Mar 31, 2022",Trans-Atlantic Team to Develop Technical Concept for NATO’s Future Surveillance and Control Capabilities,"FALLS CHURCH, Va. and MUNICH – March 31, 2022 – Airbus Defence and Space together with Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) and seven industrial players forming the ASPAARO (Atlantic Strategic Partnership for Advanced All-domain Resilient Operations)...FALLS CHURCH, Va. and MUNICH – March 31, 2022 – Airbus Defence and Space together with Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) and seven industrial players forming the ASPAARO (Atlantic Strategic Partnership for Advanced All-domain Resilient Operations) team have been selected by the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) to conduct one of three Risk Reduction and Feasibility Studies (RRFS). The studies aim to suggest technical solutions for the Alliance Future Surveillance and Control (AFSC).  In November 2021, Airbus with subcontractors Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems (UK), Exence (Poland), GMV (Spain), IBM (US), KONGSBERG (Norway), Lockheed Martin (US) and MDA (Canada) submitted a proposal to NSPA outlining how this transatlantic team would address the complexities of NATO’s future capability requirements.  The selection of the ASPAARO team as a study partner represents an important step toward providing NATO with unmatched tactical surveillance, command and control capabilities to overcome the challenges of the future and replace the current Airborne Warning and Control System fleet which will reach the end of its service life around 2035.  Over the next months the ASPAARO team will perform a thorough assessment of a fully distributed surveillance model; refine details; assess related feasibility, risks and costs; and provide a recommended technical solution with proven technologies, open standards and interfaces for the multi-domain capabilities AFSC shall provide.  “Airbus is committed to a long-lasting cooperation with NATO and its member nations on the Alliance Future Surveillance and Control (AFSC) programme. The current crisis situation is a reminder that vigilance as well as surveillance and control capabilities are of key importance to the defence of the Alliance. Airbus Defence and Space is leading the ASPAARO team which will be contributing to the Risk Reduction and Feasibility Studies. The focus is on a cross-domain fully distributed system to create the most reliable, resilient and capable solution for NATO’s future surveillance and control,” said Michael Schoellhorn, CEO of Airbus Defence and Space.  Northrop Grumman President of Aeronautics Systems Tom Jones stressed ASPAARO’s team commitment to NATO’s security mission. “The ASPAARO team brings together some of the world’s best engineers, scientists and system managers. The team is committed to offering optimum technical solutions to our NATO customer’s future surveillance and security needs.”  The outcome of the three studies will help NATO and individual allies make informed decisions on the final AFSC technical concept and acquisition of surveillance systems.

IBCS established a track from the JTAGS data before ground-based sensors were able to detect the target, thus providing increased situational awareness for the operators.  During the second flight test, IBCS demonstrated the resilience of the system to defeat two cruise missile targets in a stressing electronic attack environment. IBCS was able to maintain continuous track custody of the targets by fusing data from multiple sensors degraded by electronic attack.  The testing took place at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, utilizing operationally realistic scenarios with soldiers of the U.S. Army 3rd Battalion, 43rd Air Defense Artillery (ADA) Regiment at the controls of the system. These tests are part of the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) of IBCS, in which the system is evaluated on its operational performance prior to deployment and full-rate production.  IBCS has an open, modular and scalable architecture that is foundational to integrating all available assets in the battlespace, regardless of source, service or domain. Its architecture enables the efficient and affordable integration of current and future systems. Through numerous successful tests and demonstrations, IBCS has validated the ability to connect and fuse multi-service sensor data to multi-service weapons demonstrating JADC2 capabilities.

Their achievements pave the way for future operational missile warning and tracking systems that will defend the nation.  “Launched in 2009 and expected to operate for four years, these demonstration satellites outlived their design life threshold three times over,” said Sarah Willoughby, vice president, overhead persistent infrared and geospatial systems, Northrop Grumman. “Now we are applying what we learned from STSS for future systems to keep America and its allies safe.”  The STSS experimental spacecraft proved their ability to detect and track short-, medium-, intermediate- and intercontinental-range missiles from boost phase to midcourse, then communicate target-quality track data to command and control systems for interception.  The satellites used sensors to detect and track ballistic missiles for interception. They tracked targets; helped discriminate real threats, guide interceptors to targets, and assess interceptor hits; collected data on launches, on-orbit satellites, satellite re-entries and other space-based missions; and played a critical role in one of MDA’s integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System flight test.

Antares is scheduled to launch Saturday, Feb. 19 at 12:40 p.m. EST from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport Pad 0A at NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island, Virginia. Cygnus will rendezvous with the station on Feb. 21, where it will remain attached to the station for three months while performing the reboost. Live coverage of both the Antares launch and Cygnus berthing with the station will be available on NASA TV.  “We are expanding the suite of value-added capabilities that we offer through our proven Cygnus program,” said Steve Krein, vice president, civil and commercial space, Northrop Grumman. “The addition of reboost services to Cygnus’ capabilities provides NASA with an even greater tool to advance space science and exploration, whether that’s on the International Space Station, the moon or beyond.”  Reboosting is a critical part of altitude maintenance for the station. Earth’s atmosphere causes a slight amount of drag, causing the station’s altitude to lower slowly over time. Small, precise nudges are required to place it back into its proper orbit. Northrop Grumman will perform the adjustment service while Cygnus is berthed with the station.  Each Cygnus spacecraft is named in honor of an individual who has made great contributions to human spaceflight. For the NG-17 mission, Cygnus celebrates Piers Sellers, a former NASA astronaut and renowned climate scientist. Sellers flew on missions STS-112, STS-121 and STS-132, logging nearly 35 days in space and 41 extravehicular activity hours across six spacewalks to help construct the International Space Station. He was a strong advocate for climate research, creating and teaching solutions to limit mankind's impact on the planet. After retiring as an astronaut 2011, Sellers rejoined his colleagues at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, leading science and exploration endeavors. In 2016, he received NASA’s Distinguished Service Medal, the agency’s highest honor, before passing away later that year.  Details about the mission, as well as more information about Piers Sellers, are available on the Northrop Grumman website.

In two recent U.S. Air Force demonstrations, Northrop Grumman partnered with Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:KTOS) to showcase how its Software Programmable Open Mission System Compliant (SPOC) solution can successfully operate simultaneous waveforms with an Open Mission Systems (OMS) interface—an industry first. These demonstrations validated that Kratos and other third-party industry providers can leverage Northrop Grumman’s open software development kit to drastically reduce integration timelines and incorporate new capabilities that will help enable JADC2. The SPOC radio terminal also demonstrated on-the-fly reprogramming capability by replacing one waveform with another, and demonstrated common and stealth communications functions in a live over-the-air test.  “This technology can significantly enhance warfighter situational awareness, speed up data-to-decision timelines and enable rapid technology insertion from third-party providers,” said Jenna Paukstis, vice president, communications solutions, Northrop Grumman. “Our SPOC solution will create an affordable path to curate functions needed for JADC2 operations, and provides a new offering that will allow the DOD to easily and securely share information across military branches.”  Northrop Grumman’s SPOC solution provides the Air Force with an open architecture, advanced connectivity capability that is designed to address near-term JADC2 mission needs. The company’s SPOC solution provides simultaneous access to four radio frequency waveforms to help interconnect the joint force in JADC2 environments.  Kratos provided their industry standard BE-CDL waveforms and software-programmable tactical radios for the demonstrations. BE-CDL integration with the SPOC solution was straightforward, as was the successful demonstration of CDL interoperability between SPOC and the USG qualified Kratos’ MissionWave120 tactical radios.  “Kratos’ tactical waveforms enable the interoperability vision of JADC2 while increasing operational flexibility through software programmability. The need to rapidly develop and deploy software-defined solutions across domains in relevant timeframes will be key to mission success in the future,” said Chris Badgett, vice president of Technology, Kratos Space. “Northrop Grumman’s SPOC solution is well designed, underpinning the plug-and-play integration of open third-party waveforms such as Kratos’ library of tactical waveforms.”  Northrop Grumman was awarded a SPOC contract by the U.S. Air Force in January 2020. The company will move its SPOC solution to the next stage of development with a flight demonstration planned for next year.  Northrop Grumman’s systems, including its SPOC capabilities, will enable data as a strategic advantage across domains. The company is bringing its extensive expertise in advanced technology, software, platform integration, advanced sensors, autonomy, manned-unmanned teaming and advanced networking across all domains to support emerging JADC2 needs across the DOD and our allies.  Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:KTOS) develops and fields transformative, affordable technology, platforms and systems for United States National Security related customers, allies and commercial enterprises.
