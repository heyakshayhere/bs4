Because it can easily be integrated to drones, vehicles, vessels, masts or man-portable applications, users can rapidly deploy the system and scale its coverage as the situation demands. \u201cOperations in the electromagnetic spectrum of a modern battlefield are a constantly evolving challenge. The need to remain undetected, while deploying with discretion and agility has been at the forefront of the development of Sirius Compact,\u201d says Carl-Johan Bergholm, head of Saab\u00b4s business area Surveillance. Sirius Compact is modular, scalable and can be used stand-alone, in a network of sensors or as a complement to existing sensors. By enhancing situational awareness through silent detection, classification and prioritisation of radar and datalink emissions, it is also a force-multiplier enabling users to locate threats whilst remaining undetected. Autonomous operation enables assimilation and compilation of situational awareness information without the need to store sensitive data in the sensor. Development and production of Sirius Compact is shared between Saab in Sweden and Finland, in line with Saab\u2019s strategy to further strengthen its domestic presence on selected markets outside of Sweden. Saab will showcase Sirius Compact at the AOC Europe conference in Montpellier in France 10-12 May and at Eurosatory in Paris 13-17 June.

The new HE 448 programmable round has the ability to communicate with the new Fire Control Device 558 via a new protocol known as Firebolt\u00ae. The HE 448 round provides the FCD 558 with the exact information on round type and propellant temperature and combines this with target distance entered by the operator to determine the best trajectory. This means that Carl-Gustaf operators will be able to quickly configure a chambered round and so increase their operational effectiveness. \u201cThese firings indicates the increased battlefield capabilities of the HE 448 and that, together with the Fire Control Device 558, it is ready to be delivered to our customers.

Saab\u2019s knowledge and expertise contributed to the design and production of this world-class trainer, with more than a thousand Saab employees involved. Collectively we set out an ambitious vision: to redefine what a trainer jet is, but also how they are made, and we have succeeded,\u201d said Saab\u2019s President and CEO Micael Johansson. \u201cThis program has significantly grown our U.S. operations, fulfilling Saab\u2019s promise of U.S. jobs, technology transfer and local economic benefits.

Sales amounted to SEK 9,218m (9,088), with a growth of 1.4%. EBITDA increased and amounted to SEK 1,148m (1,066), with a margin of 12.5% (11.7). Operating income improved 10% and amounted to SEK 654m (597). The margin was 7.1% (6.6), driven by improved project execution and a favourable product mix. Operational cash flow in the quarter was SEK -179m (-160). Sustainability efforts continued with submittal of proposed targets to the Science-Based Targets initiative. The AGM decided on a dividend of SEK 4.90 per share to the shareholders. Statement by the President and CEO Micael Johansson: A solid start to the year in a changing landscape We entered the year with hopes of a return to normal after the pandemic, but we are now witnessing a humanitarian tragedy as a result of the war in Ukraine. This reminds us once again of the importance of countries\u2019 right to build their defences to protect their borders, citizens and societies. Our core belief is that peace, security and stability are fundamental for sustainability, human rights and freedom. Early implications of the crisis have changed the security landscape in Europe. This has led to a structural shift with several countries, including Sweden, Germany, UK and Finland, announcing higher defence budgets over the coming years. Saab is well positioned and ready to support customers\u2019 growing needs. Given the long-term nature of the industry, however, the prospects for further growth in orders will take some time. Due to the pandemic, we have worked intensively over the past years to manage our supply chain. With the growing geopolitical instability in the world, we see further supply chain challenges in our industry, as in many other businesses. We are working closely with our suppliers to mitigate future effects on shortages and ensure delivery of components. To meet a further demand, we will also steadily increase capacity. In the first quarter of the year, we continued to see strong interest in Saab\u2019s portfolio, particularly in Dynamics and Surveillance. Order intake increased by 38%, driven by medium-sized orders across most business areas. Order intake in our international markets increased by 78%. Dynamics received orders for training systems to the U.S. and Finland, and Surveillance received a contract for a civil security solution in Australia. At Kockums, a large contract from Sweden for the Mid-Life Upgrade of the third Gotland-class submarine was received. At the end of the quarter, the first two serially produced Gripen E fighters arrived in Brazil and their first flight in the country with Brazilian pilots has now been completed. This is an important achievement in the Gripen E programme where the two fighter jets are part of the 36 aircraft acquired by the Brazilian Air Force in 2014. Sales increased compared to the first quarter last year and amounted to SEK 9,218 million (9,088). Reported growth was 1.4%, reflecting the delivery pattern for the year that is stronger in the second half. Dynamics, Kockums and Combitech reported sales growth while sales in Aeronautics and Surveillance declined. We reiterate our sales growth outlook of around 5% for the full year. Operating income improved 10% and amounted to SEK 654m (597) in the quarter, corresponding to a margin of 7.1% (6.6). This was driven by higher gross margin as a result of improved project execution and a favourable product mix. Operational cash flow in the quarter was in line with our milestone payments plan and amounted to SEK -179 million (-160). During the quarter, we continued our extensive work on sustainability and strengthened our governance further. Consequently, we submitted proposed targets to the Science-Based Targets initiative connected to the Race to Zero commitment we announced last year. As we leave a solid first quarter behind us, we will continue our journey with a focus on sustainable growth, strengthened profitability and cash flow.

The flight to Gavi\u00e3o Peixoto lasted approximately 50 minutes and took place as planned. For the Commander of the Brazilian Air Force, General Carlos de Almeida Baptista Junior, the arrival of the first two operational aircraft represents a milestone for the defense of Brazil\u2019s national airspace. \"The arrival of the aircraft is the result of a project that sought from the beginning to increase our deterrent capabilities, as well as having the objective to foster research and industrial development in Brazil. We now have a state-of-the-art multi-mission aircraft that will be the main asset for guaranteeing the sovereignty of Brazilian airspace,\u201d highlighted the Commander. The new fighters will remain at the Gripen Flight Test Center until the aircraft obtain the Military Type Certificate, thereafter they will be transferred to An\u00e1polis for the final stages of the delivery phase. \u201cBrazil actively participates in the development, flight test campaign and production of fighter jets, as part of the broad technology transfer package to the Brazilian defence industry. The arrival of the two serial production aircraft is a result of this great collaboration,\u201d highlighted Jonas Hjelm, Senior Vice President and Head of Business Unit Aeronautics at Saab. The two fighter jets are part of the 36 Gripen aircraft acquired by the Brazilian Air Force in 2014.

Payment of the dividend is expected to be made from Euroclear Sweden AB, on Wednesday 13 April 2022. Discharge from liability                                                                              The Board of Directors and the CEO were discharged from liability for the financial year 2021.

Cecilia Steg\u00f6 Chil\u00f2 had declined re-election. Marcus Wallenberg was re-elected as Chairman of the Board. At the Board Meeting following the Annual General Meeting, Bert Nordberg was re-elected as Deputy Chairman of the Board. Auditor In accordance with the Nomination Committee\u2019s proposal, the Annual General Meeting decided to re-elect PricewaterhouseCoopers AB as Auditor until the close of the Annual General Meeting 2023. Fees to the Board of Directors and the Auditor The General Meeting decided, in accordance with the Nomination Committee\u2019s proposal, that the Board fees shall be SEK 2,065,000 to the Chairman of the Board, SEK 755,000 to the Deputy Chairman, and SEK 675,000 to each of the other Board members elected by the General Meeting and not employed by the Company.

Compensation for work in the Remuneration Committee shall be SEK 160,000 to the Chairman and SEK 100,000 to each of the other Remuneration Committee members. Fees to the Auditor are to be paid according to approved invoice. Remuneration report The Annual General Meeting decided to approve the Board of Directors\u2019 report on remuneration pursuant to Chapter 8, Section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act for the financial year 2021. Long-term incentive program 2023 and acquisition and transfer of own shares The Annual General Meeting decided in accordance with the Board\u2019s proposal of a long-term incentive program 2023 (\u201cLTI 2023\u201d), consisting of three parts: Share Matching Plan 2023, Performance Share Plan 2023 and Special Projects Incentive 2023. LTI 2022 comprises a maximum of 1,730,000 shares of series B. The Share Matching Plan 2023 covers all permanent employees. The participants can save up to five percent of the cash base salary, for purchase of shares of series B in Saab. If the purchased shares are retained for three years and employment within the Saab Group continues, the employee will be granted a corresponding number of shares of series B by Saab free of consideration. The program covers a maximum of 1,200,000 shares of series B. The Performance Share Plan 2023 is directed at a maximum of 200 key employees including the CEO. The participants can save up to 7.5 percent of the cash base salary for purchase of shares of series B in Saab. If the purchased shares are retained for three years and employment within the Saab Group continues, the employee is entitled to matching of performance shares, free of consideration, provided that the performance targets are met. The program entitles the employee to allotment of a maximum of 2-7 performance shares for each purchased share, depending on the group belonging. A new complementing performance target is introduced in the Performance Share Program 2023, in line with the Company's objective to reduce its climate impact. The new performance target refers to CO2 reduction, i.e. reduction of greenhouse gas, and the target will have a weight of 10 percent. The financial performance target free cash flow has a decreased weight from 40 to 30 percent. The number of performance shares is thus linked to four performance targets: organic sales growth (30% weight), EBIT margin (30% weight), free cash flow (30% weight) and CO2 reduction (10% weight), during the financial year 2023. The Performance Share Plan 2023 covers a maximum of 300,000 shares of series B in Saab. Special Projects Incentive 2023 is directed at a maximum of 100 key employees, including the CEO. Special Projects Incentive 2023 is a complement to the Performance Share Plan 2023. Participation in the program also presupposes participation in the Performance Share Plan 2023 or the Share Matching Plan 2023. The program entitles the employee to allotment of performance shares corresponding to a maximum of 15-52.5 per cent of the cash base salary for the financial year 2023 depending on group belonging, provided that the employment remains for three years and that performance targets are reached. The allotment of performance shares are based on the achievement of ten equally weighted performance targets during 2023, related to Saab\u2019s special projects within the product areas Gripen, airborne radar systems (AEW&C), submarines, missiles, combat management systems and advanced pilot training systems. For the CEO and other members of the Group Management, allotment of performance shares in the program and the Performance Share Plan 2023 together, may in total amount to a maximum of 75 per cent of the cash base salary for the CEO and 60 per cent of the cash base salary for the other members of the Group Management. The program covers a maximum of 230,000 shares of series B in Saab. The Annual General Meeting also decided to authorize the Board of Directors to decide on acquisition of a maximum of 1,730,000 shares of series B to secure delivery of shares to participants in Saab\u2019s incentive program. The General Meeting further decided that no more than 1,730,000 shares of series B may be transferred, free of consideration, to participants in LTI 2023. Transfers are normally made during the financial year 2026 and in February 2027 according to the conditions for LTI 2023. Acquisition and transfer of own shares The Annual General Meeting decided on authorizing the Board to, before the next Annual General Meeting, decide on the acquisition of shares of series B up to a maximum of ten percent of the total number of shares in the Company. The purpose of the authorization is to be able to adjust the Company\u2019s capital structure and thereby contribute to an increased shareholder value as well as to enable a continuous use of acquired shares in connection with potential acquisitions of companies and for the Company\u2019s share-related incentive programs. The Board of Directors was further authorized to, before the next Annual General Meeting, decide on transfer of own shares in connection with acquisition of companies. The purpose of the authorization is to provide the Board of Directors with increased scope for action in connection with financing of acquisitions of companies. It was also decided that the Company shall have the right to, in consideration of earlier years\u2019 established incentive programs, before the next Annual General Meeting, over the stock exchange transfer a maximum of 960,000 shares of series B in order to cover certain expenses, mainly social security payments. Shares and votes The company has in total 135,845,847 shares, of which 2,383,903 are shares of series A with ten votes per share and 133,461,944 are shares of series B with one vote per share, which together represent 157,300,974 votes. The Company holds 3 880 588 own shares of series B, corresponding to 3 880 588 votes.

The need to both detect and counter them all, while deploying with speed and mobility, has been at the forefront of Saab\u2019s MSHORAD system development. Based on RBS 70 NG and Giraffe 1X multi-mission 3D radar respectively, MSHORAD\u2019s vehicle-based Mobile Firing Unit (MFU) and Mobile Radar Unit (MRU), combined with a Saab command and control (C2) system, are designed and available from Saab as its MSHORAD air defence system. MSHORAD\u2019s rapid mobility provides for a tactical advantage to be exploited on the battlefield or to avoid enemy fires. It delivers a 360\u00b0, 75 km situational awareness and the capability to target the most challenging UAV threats thanks to Giraffe\u2019s Drone Tracker, an enhanced functionality for low, slow and small objects. The ability to destroy attackers comes from the unjammable RBS 70 NG missile system that operates at day and night, with rapid reloading in the field. MSHORAD\u2019s ease of integration means customers can choose from a wide range of vehicle types. It also has a dismounted capability such as from atop buildings where it can provide an additional form of operational advantage. \u201cWith the evolved threats, such as the expansion of military UAVs, it\u2019s a great milestone to have a fully working system ready to be offered to our customers. The combination of our first-class range and altitude coverage of the Mobile Firing Unit, together with the small size and multi-role capabilities of Giraffe 1X makes our MSHORAD solution the most modern and state-of-the-art solution out there,\u201d says Mats-Olof Rydberg, head of Marketing and Sales at Saab\u2019s business unit Missile Systems.   Successful system integration and test firings have already been conducted in the last 12 months in cooperation with the Czech company SVOS using their new generation of modular armoured vehicle 4x4 named MARS. Live firing demonstrations will be performed for potential customers in the near future.
