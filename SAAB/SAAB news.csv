10 May 2022,Saab’s Sirius Compact Offers New Flexibility for EW Users,"Sirius Compact brings new capabilities thanks to its low size, weight and power, particularly in comparison to equivalent larger static solutions. Because it can easily be integrated to drones, vehicles, vessels, masts or man-portable applications, users can rapidly deploy the system and scale its coverage as the situation demands.“Operations in the electromagnetic spectrum of a modern battlefield are a constantly evolving challenge. The need to remain undetected, while deploying with discretion and agility has been at the forefront of the development of Sirius Compact,” says Carl-Johan Bergholm, head of Saab´s business area Surveillance.Sirius Compact is modular, scalable and can be used stand-alone, in a network of sensors or as a complement to existing sensors. By enhancing situational awareness through silent detection, classification and prioritisation of radar and datalink emissions, it is also a force-multiplier enabling users to locate threats whilst remaining undetected. Autonomous operation enables assimilation and compilation of situational awareness information without the need to store sensitive data in the sensor.Development and production of Sirius Compact is shared between Saab in Sweden and Finland, in line with Saab’s strategy to further strengthen its domestic presence on selected markets outside of Sweden.Saab will showcase Sirius Compact at the AOC Europe conference in Montpellier in France 10-12 May and at Eurosatory in Paris 13-17 June.Learn more about Sirius Compact: www.saab.com/electronicwarfareWatch the video about Sirius Compact: https://youtu.be/q98lUoO1yWkFor further information, please contact:Saab Press Centre,+46 (0)734 180 018,presscentre@saabgroup.comwww.saab.comTwitter: @SaabFacebook: @SaabLinkedIn: SaabInstagram: SaabSaab is a leading defence and security company with an enduring mission, to help nations keep their people and society safe.

The new HE 448 programmable round has the ability to communicate with the new Fire Control Device 558 via a new protocol known as Firebolt®. The HE 448 round provides the FCD 558 with the exact information on round type and propellant temperature and combines this with target distance entered by the operator to determine the best trajectory. This means that Carl-Gustaf operators will be able to quickly configure a chambered round and so increase their operational effectiveness.“These firings indicates the increased battlefield capabilities of the HE 448 and that, together with the Fire Control Device 558, it is ready to be delivered to our customers. The HE 448 offers increased range and effectiveness against the target and has been developed drawing on our close customer relationships and our understanding of their requirements.

Saab’s knowledge and expertise contributed to the design and production of this world-class trainer, with more than a thousand Saab employees involved. Collectively we set out an ambitious vision: to redefine what a trainer jet is, but also how they are made, and we have succeeded,” said Saab’s President and CEO Micael Johansson.“This program has significantly grown our U.S. operations, fulfilling Saab’s promise of U.S. jobs, technology transfer and local economic benefits. Saab’s new advanced manufacturing and production facility for the fully installed aft fuselage of the T-7A Red Hawk, located in West Lafayette, Indiana, is a testament to Saab’s commitment to the U.S. as a multi-domestic company,” said Micael Johansson.With the T-7A Red Hawk, Boeing and Saab have applied an innovative digital strategy for design, development, and production of military aircraft.

22 April 2022,Saab’s Results January-March 2022: A solid start to the year in a changing landscape,"Key highlights Q1 2022Order intake of SEK 8,115m (5,871), corresponding to a growth of 38%, with increases in most business areas driven by medium-sized orders. Sales amounted to SEK 9,218m (9,088), with a growth of 1.4%.EBITDA increased and amounted to SEK 1,148m (1,066), with a margin of 12.5% (11.7).Operating income improved 10% and amounted to SEK 654m (597). The margin was 7.1% (6.6), driven by improved project execution and a favourable product mix.Operational cash flow in the quarter was SEK -179m (-160).Sustainability efforts continued with submittal of proposed targets to the Science-Based Targets initiative.The AGM decided on a dividend of SEK 4.90 per share to the shareholders.Statement by the President and CEO Micael Johansson:A solid start to the year in a changing landscapeWe entered the year with hopes of a return to normal after the pandemic, but we are now witnessing a humanitarian tragedy as a result of the war in Ukraine. This reminds us once again of the importance of countries’ right to build their defences to protect their borders, citizens and societies. Our core belief is that peace, security and stability are fundamental for sustainability, human rights and freedom.Early implications of the crisis have changed the security landscape in Europe. This has led to a structural shift with several countries, including Sweden, Germany, UK and Finland, announcing higher defence budgets over the coming years. Saab is well positioned and ready to support customers’ growing needs. Given the long-term nature of the industry, however, the prospects for further growth in orders will take some time.Due to the pandemic, we have worked intensively over the past years to manage our supply chain. With the growing geopolitical instability in the world, we see further supply chain challenges in our industry, as in many other businesses. We are working closely with our suppliers to mitigate future effects on shortages and ensure delivery of components. To meet a further demand, we will also steadily increase capacity.In the first quarter of the year, we continued to see strong interest in Saab’s portfolio, particularly in Dynamics and Surveillance. Order intake increased by 38%, driven by medium-sized orders across most business areas. Order intake in our international markets increased by 78%. Dynamics received orders for training systems to the U.S. and Finland, and Surveillance received a contract for a civil security solution in Australia. At Kockums, a large contract from Sweden for the Mid-Life Upgrade of the third Gotland-class submarine was received.At the end of the quarter, the first two serially produced Gripen E fighters arrived in Brazil and their first flight in the country with Brazilian pilots has now been completed. This is an important achievement in the Gripen E programme where the two fighter jets are part of the 36 aircraft acquired by the Brazilian Air Force in 2014.Sales increased compared to the first quarter last year and amounted to SEK 9,218 million (9,088). Reported growth was 1.4%, reflecting the delivery pattern for the year that is stronger in the second half. Dynamics, Kockums and Combitech reported sales growth while sales in Aeronautics and Surveillance declined. We reiterate our sales growth outlook of around 5% for the full year.Operating income improved 10% and amounted to SEK 654m (597) in the quarter, corresponding to a margin of 7.1% (6.6). This was driven by higher gross margin as a result of improved project execution and a favourable product mix.Operational cash flow in the quarter was in line with our milestone payments plan and amounted to SEK -179 million (-160).During the quarter, we continued our extensive work on sustainability and strengthened our governance further. Consequently, we submitted proposed targets to the Science-Based Targets initiative connected to the Race to Zero commitment we announced last year.As we leave a solid first quarter behind us, we will continue our journey with a focus on sustainable growth, strengthened profitability and cash flow.Financial highlightsMSEK Jan-Mar 2022 Jan-Mar 2021  Change, % Full Year 2021 Order bookings 8,115 5,871 38 43,569Order backlog 104,537 97,211 8 105,177Sales 9,218 9,088 1 39,154Gross income 2,034 1,934 5 8,205Gross margin, % 22.1 21.3 21.0EBITDA 1,148 1,066 8 4,826EBITDA margin, % 12.5 11.7 12.3Operating income (EBIT) 654 597 10 2,888Operating margin, % 7.1 6.6 7.4Net income 372 396 -6 2,025of which Parent Company’s shareholders’ interest 354 392 -10 1,926Earnings per share after dilution, SEK 2.66 2.94 14.45Return on equity, % ¹⁾ 8.4 5.2 9.0Operational cash flow -179 -160 3,276Free cash flow -361 -265 2,737Free cash flow per share after dilution, SEK -2.71 -1.99 20.53Average number of shares after dilution 133,267,371 133,213,468 133,293,340¹⁾  Return on equity is measured over a rolling 12-month period.MSEKOrder bookingsOrder backlogSalesGross incomeGross margin, %EBITDAEBITDA margin, %Operating income (EBIT)Operating margin, %Net incomeof which Parent Company’s shareholders’ interestEarnings per share after dilution, SEKReturn on equity, % ¹⁾Operational cash flowFree cash flowFree cash flow per share after dilution, SEKAverage number of shares after dilution¹⁾  Return on equity is measured over a rolling 12-month period.For more information and explanations regarding the usage of these key ratios, please see http://saab.com/investors/financial-data/key-ratios/Saab’s Interim Report January-March 2022 PresentationSaab’s CEO and President Micael Johansson and CFO and deputy CEO Christian Luiga will present the Saab interim report for January-March 2022.Date:            Friday, 22 April at 10:00 (CET).The report is published at 07.30 a.m. (CET) the same day at http://www.saab.com.

LTI 2022 comprises a maximum of 1,730,000 shares of series B.The Share Matching Plan 2023 covers all permanent employees. The participants can save up to five percent of the cash base salary, for purchase of shares of series B in Saab. If the purchased shares are retained for three years and employment within the Saab Group continues, the employee will be granted a corresponding number of shares of series B by Saab free of consideration. The program covers a maximum of 1,200,000 shares of series B.The Performance Share Plan 2023 is directed at a maximum of 200 key employees including the CEO. The participants can save up to 7.5 percent of the cash base salary for purchase of shares of series B in Saab. If the purchased shares are retained for three years and employment within the Saab Group continues, the employee is entitled to matching of performance shares, free of consideration, provided that the performance targets are met. The program entitles the employee to allotment of a maximum of 2-7 performance shares for each purchased share, depending on the group belonging. A new complementing performance target is introduced in the Performance Share Program 2023, in line with the Company's objective to reduce its climate impact. The new performance target refers to CO2 reduction, i.e. reduction of greenhouse gas, and the target will have a weight of 10 percent. The financial performance target free cash flow has a decreased weight from 40 to 30 percent. The number of performance shares is thus linked to four performance targets: organic sales growth (30% weight), EBIT margin (30% weight), free cash flow (30% weight) and CO2 reduction (10% weight), during the financial year 2023. The Performance Share Plan 2023 covers a maximum of 300,000 shares of series B in Saab.Special Projects Incentive 2023 is directed at a maximum of 100 key employees, including the CEO. Special Projects Incentive 2023 is a complement to the Performance Share Plan 2023. Participation in the program also presupposes participation in the Performance Share Plan 2023 or the Share Matching Plan 2023. The program entitles the employee to allotment of performance shares corresponding to a maximum of 15-52.5 per cent of the cash base salary for the financial year 2023 depending on group belonging, provided that the employment remains for three years and that performance targets are reached. The allotment of performance shares are based on the achievement of ten equally weighted performance targets during 2023, related to Saab’s special projects within the product areas Gripen, airborne radar systems (AEW&C), submarines, missiles, combat management systems and advanced pilot training systems. For the CEO and other members of the Group Management, allotment of performance shares in the program and the Performance Share Plan 2023 together, may in total amount to a maximum of 75 per cent of the cash base salary for the CEO and 60 per cent of the cash base salary for the other members of the Group Management. The program covers a maximum of 230,000 shares of series B in Saab.The Annual General Meeting also decided to authorize the Board of Directors to decide on acquisition of a maximum of 1,730,000 shares of series B to secure delivery of shares to participants in Saab’s incentive program.

The purpose of the authorization is to be able to adjust the Company’s capital structure and thereby contribute to an increased shareholder value as well as to enable a continuous use of acquired shares in connection with potential acquisitions of companies and for the Company’s share-related incentive programs.The Board of Directors was further authorized to, before the next Annual General Meeting, decide on transfer of own shares in connection with acquisition of companies.

30 March 2022,Saab’s MSHORAD Stays Ahead of Evolved Threats,"A wide range of established airborne threats such as fighters, helicopters, and missiles are being joined by newer threats such as armed UAV’s and loitering munitions. The need to both detect and counter them all, while deploying with speed and mobility, has been at the forefront of Saab’s MSHORAD system development. Based on RBS 70 NG and Giraffe 1X multi-mission 3D radar respectively, MSHORAD’s vehicle-based Mobile Firing Unit (MFU) and Mobile Radar Unit (MRU), combined with a Saab command and control (C2) system, are designed and available from Saab as its MSHORAD air defence system.MSHORAD’s rapid mobility provides for a tactical advantage to be exploited on the battlefield or to avoid enemy fires. It delivers a 360°, 75 km situational awareness and the capability to target the most challenging UAV threats thanks to Giraffe’s Drone Tracker, an enhanced functionality for low, slow and small objects. The ability to destroy attackers comes from the unjammable RBS 70 NG missile system that operates at day and night, with rapid reloading in the field. MSHORAD’s ease of integration means customers can choose from a wide range of vehicle types. It also has a dismounted capability such as from atop buildings where it can provide an additional form of operational advantage.“With the evolved threats, such as the expansion of military UAVs, it’s a great milestone to have a fully working system ready to be offered to our customers. The combination of our first-class range and altitude coverage of the Mobile Firing Unit, together with the small size and multi-role capabilities of Giraffe 1X makes our MSHORAD solution the most modern and state-of-the-art solution out there,” says Mats-Olof Rydberg, head of Marketing and Sales at Saab’s business unit Missile Systems.  Successful system integration and test firings have already been conducted in the last 12 months in cooperation with the Czech company SVOS using their new generation of modular armoured vehicle 4x4 named MARS. Live firing demonstrations will be performed for potential customers in the near future.Learn more about MSHORAD: saab.com/MSHORADSee the launch video: https://youtu.be/VZOUSsx4XrUFor further information, please contact:Saab Press Centre,+46 (0)734 180 018presscentre@saabgroup.comwww.saab.comTwitter: @SaabFacebook: @saab LinkedIn: SaabInstagram: SaabSaab is a leading defence and security company with an enduring mission, to help nations keep their people and society safe.
