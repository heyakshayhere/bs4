(NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) reported first-quarter results today, including the expansion of its 5G Ultra Wideband network to nearly 113 million people around the country and elevated demands for its 5G mobility and nationwide broadband services. The company's performance produced its best broadband result in over a decade, a surge in upgrades and increased wireless service revenue growth. \u00a0\"Our operational performance in the first-quarter further positions Verizon for long-term growth and increases our competitive standing in mobility, nationwide broadband, the value market, and above the network business solutions and applications,\u201d said Verizon Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg. \"The January launch of C-Band and expansion of our 5G Ultra Wideband network helped to amplify our fixed wireless momentum in both Consumer and Business, with quarterly additions 2.5 times that of our fourth-quarter performance, and drove momentum in wireless upgrades. We continue to accelerate our C-Band network build with our goal of reaching at least 175 million people by the end of the year and, with the recent early clearing spectrum announcement, we now have the ability to deploy more of this spectrum a full year sooner.\u201dFor first-quarter 2022, Verizon reported EPS of $1.09, compared with $1.27 in first-quarter 2021. On an adjusted basis1, EPS, excluding special items, was $1.35 in first-quarter 2022, compared with adjusted EPS1 of $1.36 in first-quarter 20212.\u00a0Reported first-quarter earnings consisted of a pre-tax loss from special items of approximately $1.5 billion, including a pre-tax loss of approximately $1.2 billion from early debt redemption costs. Additionally, the impact to amortization of intangible assets related to TracFone and other acquisitions was $238 million.\u201cAt our Investor Day last month, we presented our strategy for investing in and growing the business to generate an incremental $14 billion of service and other revenue by 2025. The bottom-line performance of our results today shows the strength of our core business to deliver profitability, even during a period of significant investment,\" \u00a0said Verizon Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis. \"We expect that over 75 percent of our growth over the next four years will come from 5G mobility and nationwide broadband. In the first-quarter, we saw growth in our wireless sales, customer loyalty, and rapid expansion of our fixed wireless product, fortifying our confidence in our growth prospects.\u201dConsolidated resultsTotal consolidated operating revenues in first-quarter 2022 were $33.6 billion, up 2.1 percent from first-quarter 2021.\u00a0Total wireless service revenue growth was 9.5 percent, reflecting the first full quarter of TracFone ownership, as well as continued execution of our Network as a Service strategy and contributions from our five vectors of growth.Service and other revenue was down 2.5 percent, as the revenues lost from Verizon Media Group (Verizon Media) more than offset incremental revenue from TracFone. Excluding the impact of the sale of Verizon Media, service and other revenue was up 4.2 percent from first-quarter 2021.\u00a0Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter totaled $6.8 billion compared with $9.7 billion \u00a0in first-quarter 2021. The reduction was primarily due to working capital impacts as the increase in activation volumes to more normal levels impacted receivable levels, and inventory levels increased as part of supply chain management in the current environment.Capital spending for the first-quarter totaled $5.8 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion compared to first-quarter 2021 driven by C-Band spending of $1.5 billion. The continued build out of OneFiber and Verizon's investment to support traffic growth on its 4G LTE network while expanding the reach and capacity of its 5G Ultra Wideband network enhances its opportunity to effectively compete in all of its businesses. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow1 for the first-quarter of the year of $1.0 billion.Verizon's unsecured debt as of the end of first-quarter 2022 increased by $614 million sequentially to $137.3 billion. The company's net unsecured debt1 balance increased sequentially by $1.9 billion to $135.6 billion, and its net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio1 at quarter-end was approximately 2.8 times, as it issued its fourth Green Bond, with the net proceeds expected to be allocated to renewable energy. In addition, the company completed a number of other transactions during the quarter the proceeds of which were used as consideration in an over $5 billion tender offer to retire some higher cost, long-term debt.\u00a0Verizon Consumer resultsTotal Verizon Consumer revenue for the quarter grew 10.9 percent year over year, driven by the first full quarter of TracFone integration, higher equipment revenue, and strong core wireless service revenue growth. Total Verizon Consumer revenues were $25.3 billion.Wireless service revenue was up 11.2 percent year over year. In addition to the inclusion of TracFone, Postpaid ARPA increased 2.6 percent driven primarily by step-up momentum and growth within non-connectivity products and services. Verizon Consumer ended the quarter with 36 percent of its account base on a premium tier.\u00a0Verizon Consumer wireless retail postpaid churn was 0.95 percent in first-quarter 2022, and wireless retail postpaid phone churn was 0.77 percent.\u00a0While churn was steady, the competitive dynamics within the industry resulted in wireless retail postpaid phone net losses of 292,000, due to a decline in gross additions of 2 percent from prior year.\u00a0Verizon Consumer had fixed wireless net additions of 112,000 for the quarter, with sales boosted by Verizon's launch of C-Band spectrum and \"5G Ultra\" campaign. Additionally, Fios internet net additions for the quarter were 55,000, driven by record-low churn levels with gross additions lower compared to first-quarter 2021. Verizon Consumer Fios revenues were $2.9 billion in first-quarter 2022, an increase of 1.8 percent year over year. Verizon Consumer reported 78,000 Fios Video net losses in first-quarter 2022.Prepaid ARPU in the quarter was $30.89 across all of Verizon Consumer's prepaid brands. This decline over first-quarter 2021 results was driven, in part, by pressure in the TracFone brands, though prepaid ARPU is expected to stabilize and subsequently grow sequentially as we execute our strategy to bring additional value to our customers.In first-quarter 2022, Verizon Consumer operating income was $7.3 billion, a decrease of 2.7 percent year over year, and segment operating income margin was 28.9 percent, a decrease from 33 percent in first-quarter 2021. Segment EBITDA1 for the quarter grew 1.0 percent, driven by the inclusion of TracFone results, as well as ARPA and customer volume gains, partially offset by the elevated marketing expenses related to the 5G Ultra campaign, investments in TracFone, and higher bad debt, driven in part by the additional sales volumes in the quarter. Segment EBITDA margin1 of 41.4 percent was impacted by significantly higher equipment revenue and the inclusion of TracFone.Verizon Business resultsTotal Verizon Business revenues were $7.7 billion in first-quarter 2022, down 0.9 percent year over year. Ongoing legacy wireline declines continue to offset Wireless revenue growth. \u00a0Verizon Business wireless service revenues were $3.1 billion, an increase of 2.1 percent, driven by momentum in the SMB market, which continues to see strong post pandemic recovery.\u00a0Verizon Business reported 395,000 wireless retail postpaid net additions in first-quarter 2022, including 256,000 phone net additions. This was the best quarterly phone net addition performance for Business since Verizon 2.0 reporting began.Verizon Business wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.34 percent in first-quarter 2022, and wireless retail postpaid phone churn was 1.06 percent.Verizon Business reported 82,000 Fixed Wireless net additions for the quarter, up substantially from the prior quarter. The flexibility, reliability and value of the product have generated an elevated demand and competitive wins within this space. \u00a0In first-quarter 2022, Verizon Business operating income was $673 million, a decrease of 25.1 percent year over year, and segment operating income margin was 8.7 percent, a decrease from 11.6 percent in first-quarter 2021. Segment EBITDA1 was $1.7 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 9.3 percent, driven in part by the loss of high margin wireline revenue. Segment EBITDA margin1 was 22.5 percent, a decrease from 24.6 percent in first-quarter 2021.\u00a0Outlook and guidance\u00a0For 2022, Verizon is updating its prior guidance for service and other revenue which is now expected to be approximately flat compared to 2021.\u00a0Additionally, Verizon expects the following results for full-year 2022:Reported wireless service revenue growth at the lower end of the previously guided range of 9 percent to 10 percent.Adjusted EBITDA1 growth at the lower end of the previously guided range of 2 percent to 3 percent.Adjusted EPS1 at the lower end of the previously guided range of $5.40 to $5.55.\u00a0Adjusted effective income tax rate1 in the range of 23 percent to 25 percent.Capital spending, excluding C-Band, in the range of $16.5 billion to $17.5 billion. Additional expenditures related to the deployment of the company's C-Band 5G network are expected to be in the range of $5 billion to $6 billion.In addition to announcing first-quarter results, today, the company published its 2021 ESG Report, outlining its approach to the company's ESG strategy and integration, and detailing the company's progress on important ESG issues, such as carbon emissions, energy efficiency, data protection and privacy, employee engagement and human rights.\u00a01Non-GAAP financial measure.

The reduction was primarily due to working capital impacts as the increase in activation volumes to more normal levels impacted receivable levels, and inventory levels increased as part of supply chain management in the current environment.Capital spending for the first-quarter totaled $5.8 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion compared to first-quarter 2021 driven by C-Band spending of $1.5 billion. The continued build out of OneFiber and Verizon's investment to support traffic growth on its 4G LTE network while expanding the reach and capacity of its 5G Ultra Wideband network enhances its opportunity to effectively compete in all of its businesses. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow1 for the first-quarter of the year of $1.0 billion.Verizon's unsecured debt as of the end of first-quarter 2022 increased by $614 million sequentially to $137.3 billion. The company's net unsecured debt1 balance increased sequentially by $1.9 billion to $135.6 billion, and its net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio1 at quarter-end was approximately 2.8 times, as it issued its fourth Green Bond, with the net proceeds expected to be allocated to renewable energy. In addition, the company completed a number of other transactions during the quarter the proceeds of which were used as consideration in an over $5 billion tender offer to retire some higher cost, long-term debt.\u00a0Verizon Consumer resultsTotal Verizon Consumer revenue for the quarter grew 10.9 percent year over year, driven by the first full quarter of TracFone integration, higher equipment revenue, and strong core wireless service revenue growth. Total Verizon Consumer revenues were $25.3 billion.Wireless service revenue was up 11.2 percent year over year. In addition to the inclusion of TracFone, Postpaid ARPA increased 2.6 percent driven primarily by step-up momentum and growth within non-connectivity products and services. Verizon Consumer ended the quarter with 36 percent of its account base on a premium tier.\u00a0Verizon Consumer wireless retail postpaid churn was 0.95 percent in first-quarter 2022, and wireless retail postpaid phone churn was 0.77 percent.\u00a0While churn was steady, the competitive dynamics within the industry resulted in wireless retail postpaid phone net losses of 292,000, due to a decline in gross additions of 2 percent from prior year.\u00a0Verizon Consumer had fixed wireless net additions of 112,000 for the quarter, with sales boosted by Verizon's launch of C-Band spectrum and \"5G Ultra\" campaign. Additionally, Fios internet net additions for the quarter were 55,000, driven by record-low churn levels with gross additions lower compared to first-quarter 2021. Verizon Consumer Fios revenues were $2.9 billion in first-quarter 2022, an increase of 1.8 percent year over year. Verizon Consumer reported 78,000 Fios Video net losses in first-quarter 2022.Prepaid ARPU in the quarter was $30.89 across all of Verizon Consumer's prepaid brands. This decline over first-quarter 2021 results was driven, in part, by pressure in the TracFone brands, though prepaid ARPU is expected to stabilize and subsequently grow sequentially as we execute our strategy to bring additional value to our customers.In first-quarter 2022, Verizon Consumer operating income was $7.3 billion, a decrease of 2.7 percent year over year, and segment operating income margin was 28.9 percent, a decrease from 33 percent in first-quarter 2021. Segment EBITDA1 for the quarter grew 1.0 percent, driven by the inclusion of TracFone results, as well as ARPA and customer volume gains, partially offset by the elevated marketing expenses related to the 5G Ultra campaign, investments in TracFone, and higher bad debt, driven in part by the additional sales volumes in the quarter. Segment EBITDA margin1 of 41.4 percent was impacted by significantly higher equipment revenue and the inclusion of TracFone.Verizon Business resultsTotal Verizon Business revenues were $7.7 billion in first-quarter 2022, down 0.9 percent year over year. Ongoing legacy wireline declines continue to offset Wireless revenue growth. \u00a0Verizon Business wireless service revenues were $3.1 billion, an increase of 2.1 percent, driven by momentum in the SMB market, which continues to see strong post pandemic recovery.\u00a0Verizon Business reported 395,000 wireless retail postpaid net additions in first-quarter 2022, including 256,000 phone net additions. This was the best quarterly phone net addition performance for Business since Verizon 2.0 reporting began.Verizon Business wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.34 percent in first-quarter 2022, and wireless retail postpaid phone churn was 1.06 percent.Verizon Business reported 82,000 Fixed Wireless net additions for the quarter, up substantially from the prior quarter. The flexibility, reliability and value of the product have generated an elevated demand and competitive wins within this space. \u00a0In first-quarter 2022, Verizon Business operating income was $673 million, a decrease of 25.1 percent year over year, and segment operating income margin was 8.7 percent, a decrease from 11.6 percent in first-quarter 2021. Segment EBITDA1 was $1.7 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 9.3 percent, driven in part by the loss of high margin wireline revenue. Segment EBITDA margin1 was 22.5 percent, a decrease from 24.6 percent in first-quarter 2021.\u00a0Outlook and guidance\u00a0For 2022, Verizon is updating its prior guidance for service and other revenue which is now expected to be approximately flat compared to 2021.\u00a0Additionally, Verizon expects the following results for full-year 2022:Reported wireless service revenue growth at the lower end of the previously guided range of 9 percent to 10 percent.Adjusted EBITDA1 growth at the lower end of the previously guided range of 2 percent to 3 percent.Adjusted EPS1 at the lower end of the previously guided range of $5.40 to $5.55.\u00a0Adjusted effective income tax rate1 in the range of 23 percent to 25 percent.Capital spending, excluding C-Band, in the range of $16.5 billion to $17.5 billion. Additional expenditures related to the deployment of the company's C-Band 5G network are expected to be in the range of $5 billion to $6 billion.In addition to announcing first-quarter results, today, the company published its 2021 ESG Report, outlining its approach to the company's ESG strategy and integration, and detailing the company's progress on important ESG issues, such as carbon emissions, energy efficiency, data protection and privacy, employee engagement and human rights.\u00a01Non-GAAP financial measure.

What is noteworthy is seeing how businesses are leveraging lessons learned to innovate and improve their operations to meet customer and employee demands. In a new white paper published this week with Boston Consulting Group, Verizon Business CEO, Tami Erwin, and Verizon Business Chief Revenue Officer, Sampath Sowmyanarayan, break down how something as simple as altering the way meetings are conducted can greatly impact productivity, while providing insight, tips, and best practices from an extensive in-house experiment.\u201cEvery leader today needs to reimagine the path forward for their business in a hybrid world. Verizon Business and BCG partnered to share concrete learnings that enable greater flexibility, connection, and collaboration,\u201d said Tami Erwin, CEO of Verizon Business. \u201cBecause at the heart of it all, we know it takes the right technology infrastructure, security, and solutions, along with the right training and resources, to ensure businesses effectively navigate new ways of working.\u201dFor organizations, the quick shift to a remote or distributed working model was an initial shock to the system, but now can be viewed as an opportunity to shape how employees adopt and adapt to new collaboration tools and processes. To make a meaningful impact, it\u2019s not wholesale changes that win the day, it\u2019s simple actions that make the biggest difference, such as:Adopt simple, impactful practices to improve meetings:Schedule 25- or 50-minute meetings with a 5-10 minute lagged start timeClearly state the meeting\u2019s purpose and agenda on the meeting invitationReassess the need for regular recurring meetingsIdentify and challenge the need for meetings that can be replaced by asynchronous modes of work, i.e., email, chat, shared documents, or offline reviewFor one month, Verizon Business analyzed the meeting habits of a team of roughly 150 employees, where they tracked the success of various changes to meetings. The experimental practices were devised in collaboration with the team, recognizing the importance of designing new ways from within and not simply imposing them from the outside. Throughout the month, daily and weekly surveys were sent to participants for continuous feedback, enabling the real-time evolution of processes and practices. The results were overwhelmingly positive, demonstrating the impact small changes can drive:90 percent of participants said that the new ways of managing meetings helped improve overall meeting effectiveness83 percent said they feel more comfortable working through asynchronous modes, such as email, collaboration tools, and shared documents78 percent said they feel like they are wasting less time sitting in meetings where their live participation isn\u2019t requiredThe 4-step process to identifying, implementing, and supporting simple actions to change how work gets done.Walk the talk: Secure support from a respected leader from the start.Design from within: Understand pain points and arrive at best practices from within the teams that you are targeting for change. Make it their idea.Make it easy: Create and re-create supporting tools to drive implementation and measure success. Ensure you have the right technology and solution infrastructure in place to accomplish effective hybrid communications plans.Iterate as you go: Create regular and frequent feedback cycles to support the continued adaptation of new meeting modes and supporting tools.The next step is to scale. As noted in Step 3, making the process simple and easy to recreate sets the stage for broad expansion across the organization. The experiment conducted by Verizon can be implemented by any business. Additionally, Verizon Business has the solutions, expertise, and network technology to help businesses forge their own unique path toward transformation. From reworking their cybersecurity architecture or implementing the solutions to harness the power of 5G to simply adjusting their approach to meetings, Verizon has businesses covered.The pandemic may have forced the hand of many business decision-makers to forever alter their operations, but in turn, it has opened the doors to take advantage of new ways of working. Making small adjustments such as changing bad meeting habits can help employees meet less and accomplish more.

To make a meaningful impact, it\u2019s not wholesale changes that win the day, it\u2019s simple actions that make the biggest difference, such as:Adopt simple, impactful practices to improve meetings:Schedule 25- or 50-minute meetings with a 5-10 minute lagged start timeClearly state the meeting\u2019s purpose and agenda on the meeting invitationReassess the need for regular recurring meetingsIdentify and challenge the need for meetings that can be replaced by asynchronous modes of work, i.e., email, chat, shared documents, or offline reviewFor one month, Verizon Business analyzed the meeting habits of a team of roughly 150 employees, where they tracked the success of various changes to meetings. The experimental practices were devised in collaboration with the team, recognizing the importance of designing new ways from within and not simply imposing them from the outside. Throughout the month, daily and weekly surveys were sent to participants for continuous feedback, enabling the real-time evolution of processes and practices. The results were overwhelmingly positive, demonstrating the impact small changes can drive:90 percent of participants said that the new ways of managing meetings helped improve overall meeting effectiveness83 percent said they feel more comfortable working through asynchronous modes, such as email, collaboration tools, and shared documents78 percent said they feel like they are wasting less time sitting in meetings where their live participation isn\u2019t requiredThe 4-step process to identifying, implementing, and supporting simple actions to change how work gets done.Walk the talk: Secure support from a respected leader from the start.Design from within: Understand pain points and arrive at best practices from within the teams that you are targeting for change. Make it their idea.Make it easy: Create and re-create supporting tools to drive implementation and measure success. Ensure you have the right technology and solution infrastructure in place to accomplish effective hybrid communications plans.Iterate as you go: Create regular and frequent feedback cycles to support the continued adaptation of new meeting modes and supporting tools.The next step is to scale. As noted in Step 3, making the process simple and easy to recreate sets the stage for broad expansion across the organization. The experiment conducted by Verizon can be implemented by any business. Additionally, Verizon Business has the solutions, expertise, and network technology to help businesses forge their own unique path toward transformation. From reworking their cybersecurity architecture or implementing the solutions to harness the power of 5G to simply adjusting their approach to meetings, Verizon has businesses covered.The pandemic may have forced the hand of many business decision-makers to forever alter their operations, but in turn, it has opened the doors to take advantage of new ways of working. Making small adjustments such as changing bad meeting habits can help employees meet less and accomplish more.","12":"04.19.2022|Networks & Platforms|Networks Solutions for BusinessVerizon Connect adds Intuit QuickBooks Online integration to Reveal Field Media contact(s)Krys Card Grondorfkrys.grondorf@verizon.comKatie Magnottakatie.magnotta@verizon.com Enhancement delivers easier, more efficient way for customers to seamlessly start to build and sync invoicesFull Transparency No UpdatesLearn moreWe're committed to building trust.The Verizon Newsroom greatly values transparency.

After the past two years, people have become familiar with a hybrid retail model known as buy online pickup in store (BOPIS) but now Verizon is making it even easier to do business with by adding buy online pickup in locker (BOPIL) as an option with Express Pickup Lockers. Verizon has offered in-store pickup for years and more recently introduced curbside pickup along with same-day delivery. Now Express Pickup Lockers are being rolled out at locations across the country ensuring seamless, efficient transactions,with increased customer satisfaction, and in select locations 24 hour access to their purchases.\u201cTime is precious, which is why we want to give our customers options that work for their busy lives,\u201d said Kelley Kurtzman, Senior Vice President of Consumer Field Sales at Verizon. \u201cOur lockers are a new and innovative way Verizon is bridging the gap between traditional retail and e-commerce, giving our customers more ways than ever to get what they need and get on with their day.\u201dVerizon has installed secure lockers at 250 retail locations across the US, with more being added each month. In select locations lockers are installed in areas where customers can pick up their purchases outside of normal Verizon store hours - even overnight. Customers can select the Express Pickup Locker option (where available) when purchasing items online at www.verizon.com or through the MyVerizon App.Choices when it comes to the retail experience are here to stay. Verizon today released findings of a new survey of U.S. residents on their seasonal cleaning and shopping behaviors. The survey found that more than two in five (42%) Americans used curbside pickup at a retailer. One in three Americans used grocery delivery (33%) and virtual appointments (33%). And almost one in five (17%) used a locker site to pick up their purchase.\u00a0And interest in lockers is only continuing to grow.\u00a0In fact, the survey showed:Three in four (75%) Americans would pick up their purchase at a secure locker rather than having to go into a store or wait for an online shipment if retailers provided this optionMore than half (55%) would use this service to avoid lines and crowds, 48% would use it to do so on their own schedules after hours and 45% simply to save timeAbout two in five would use a locker to avoid having to wait for shipping times and get the merchandise they need quickly (40%) or to relieve concerns of packages being stolen from outside their home by \u201cporch pirates\u201d (38%).Of course, Verizon\u2019s full-service stores have retail specialists ready to help customers with all of their needs. For customers who prefer to buy online, but don\u2019t want to wait for products to ship, Verizon offers Express Pickup options including in-store, curbside, doorside and locker pickup at select retail locations across the country.\u00a0Available Express Pickup options are provided on the MyVerizon app and when completing online orders at www.verizon.com.

Now Express Pickup Lockers are being rolled out at locations across the country ensuring seamless, efficient transactions,with increased customer satisfaction, and in select locations 24 hour access to their purchases.\u201cTime is precious, which is why we want to give our customers options that work for their busy lives,\u201d said Kelley Kurtzman, Senior Vice President of Consumer Field Sales at Verizon. \u201cOur lockers are a new and innovative way Verizon is bridging the gap between traditional retail and e-commerce, giving our customers more ways than ever to get what they need and get on with their day.\u201dVerizon has installed secure lockers at 250 retail locations across the US, with more being added each month. In select locations lockers are installed in areas where customers can pick up their purchases outside of normal Verizon store hours - even overnight. Customers can select the Express Pickup Locker option (where available) when purchasing items online at www.verizon.com or through the MyVerizon App.Choices when it comes to the retail experience are here to stay. Verizon today released findings of a new survey of U.S. residents on their seasonal cleaning and shopping behaviors. The survey found that more than two in five (42%) Americans used curbside pickup at a retailer. One in three Americans used grocery delivery (33%) and virtual appointments (33%). And almost one in five (17%) used a locker site to pick up their purchase.\u00a0And interest in lockers is only continuing to grow.\u00a0In fact, the survey showed:Three in four (75%) Americans would pick up their purchase at a secure locker rather than having to go into a store or wait for an online shipment if retailers provided this optionMore than half (55%) would use this service to avoid lines and crowds, 48% would use it to do so on their own schedules after hours and 45% simply to save timeAbout two in five would use a locker to avoid having to wait for shipping times and get the merchandise they need quickly (40%) or to relieve concerns of packages being stolen from outside their home by \u201cporch pirates\u201d (38%).Of course, Verizon\u2019s full-service stores have retail specialists ready to help customers with all of their needs. For customers who prefer to buy online, but don\u2019t want to wait for products to ship, Verizon offers Express Pickup options including in-store, curbside, doorside and locker pickup at select retail locations across the country.\u00a0Available Express Pickup options are provided on the MyVerizon app and when completing online orders at www.verizon.com.","22":"04.22.2022|Financial|EarningsVerizon reports 1Q earnings for 2022 Media contact(s)Kim Ancin908.801.0500Kimberly.Ancin@verizon.com     Company reports record demand for fixed wireless broadband, wireless service revenue growth and continued 5G Ultra Wideband network expansionFull Transparency No UpdatesLearn moreWe're committed to building trust.The Verizon Newsroom greatly values transparency.

(NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) reported first-quarter results today, including the expansion of its 5G Ultra Wideband network to nearly 113 million people around the country and elevated demands for its 5G mobility and nationwide broadband services. The company's performance produced its best broadband result in over a decade, a surge in upgrades and increased wireless service revenue growth. \u00a0\"Our operational performance in the first-quarter further positions Verizon for long-term growth and increases our competitive standing in mobility, nationwide broadband, the value market, and above the network business solutions and applications,\u201d said Verizon Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg. \"The January launch of C-Band and expansion of our 5G Ultra Wideband network helped to amplify our fixed wireless momentum in both Consumer and Business, with quarterly additions 2.5 times that of our fourth-quarter performance, and drove momentum in wireless upgrades. We continue to accelerate our C-Band network build with our goal of reaching at least 175 million people by the end of the year and, with the recent early clearing spectrum announcement, we now have the ability to deploy more of this spectrum a full year sooner.\u201dFor first-quarter 2022, Verizon reported EPS of $1.09, compared with $1.27 in first-quarter 2021. On an adjusted basis1, EPS, excluding special items, was $1.35 in first-quarter 2022, compared with adjusted EPS1 of $1.36 in first-quarter 20212.\u00a0Reported first-quarter earnings consisted of a pre-tax loss from special items of approximately $1.5 billion, including a pre-tax loss of approximately $1.2 billion from early debt redemption costs. Additionally, the impact to amortization of intangible assets related to TracFone and other acquisitions was $238 million.\u201cAt our Investor Day last month, we presented our strategy for investing in and growing the business to generate an incremental $14 billion of service and other revenue by 2025. The bottom-line performance of our results today shows the strength of our core business to deliver profitability, even during a period of significant investment,\" \u00a0said Verizon Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis. \"We expect that over 75 percent of our growth over the next four years will come from 5G mobility and nationwide broadband. In the first-quarter, we saw growth in our wireless sales, customer loyalty, and rapid expansion of our fixed wireless product, fortifying our confidence in our growth prospects.\u201dConsolidated resultsTotal consolidated operating revenues in first-quarter 2022 were $33.6 billion, up 2.1 percent from first-quarter 2021.\u00a0Total wireless service revenue growth was 9.5 percent, reflecting the first full quarter of TracFone ownership, as well as continued execution of our Network as a Service strategy and contributions from our five vectors of growth.Service and other revenue was down 2.5 percent, as the revenues lost from Verizon Media Group (Verizon Media) more than offset incremental revenue from TracFone. Excluding the impact of the sale of Verizon Media, service and other revenue was up 4.2 percent from first-quarter 2021.\u00a0Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter totaled $6.8 billion compared with $9.7 billion \u00a0in first-quarter 2021. The reduction was primarily due to working capital impacts as the increase in activation volumes to more normal levels impacted receivable levels, and inventory levels increased as part of supply chain management in the current environment.Capital spending for the first-quarter totaled $5.8 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion compared to first-quarter 2021 driven by C-Band spending of $1.5 billion. The continued build out of OneFiber and Verizon's investment to support traffic growth on its 4G LTE network while expanding the reach and capacity of its 5G Ultra Wideband network enhances its opportunity to effectively compete in all of its businesses. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow1 for the first-quarter of the year of $1.0 billion.Verizon's unsecured debt as of the end of first-quarter 2022 increased by $614 million sequentially to $137.3 billion. The company's net unsecured debt1 balance increased sequentially by $1.9 billion to $135.6 billion, and its net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio1 at quarter-end was approximately 2.8 times, as it issued its fourth Green Bond, with the net proceeds expected to be allocated to renewable energy. In addition, the company completed a number of other transactions during the quarter the proceeds of which were used as consideration in an over $5 billion tender offer to retire some higher cost, long-term debt.\u00a0Verizon Consumer resultsTotal Verizon Consumer revenue for the quarter grew 10.9 percent year over year, driven by the first full quarter of TracFone integration, higher equipment revenue, and strong core wireless service revenue growth. Total Verizon Consumer revenues were $25.3 billion.Wireless service revenue was up 11.2 percent year over year. In addition to the inclusion of TracFone, Postpaid ARPA increased 2.6 percent driven primarily by step-up momentum and growth within non-connectivity products and services. Verizon Consumer ended the quarter with 36 percent of its account base on a premium tier.\u00a0Verizon Consumer wireless retail postpaid churn was 0.95 percent in first-quarter 2022, and wireless retail postpaid phone churn was 0.77 percent.\u00a0While churn was steady, the competitive dynamics within the industry resulted in wireless retail postpaid phone net losses of 292,000, due to a decline in gross additions of 2 percent from prior year.\u00a0Verizon Consumer had fixed wireless net additions of 112,000 for the quarter, with sales boosted by Verizon's launch of C-Band spectrum and \"5G Ultra\" campaign. Additionally, Fios internet net additions for the quarter were 55,000, driven by record-low churn levels with gross additions lower compared to first-quarter 2021. Verizon Consumer Fios revenues were $2.9 billion in first-quarter 2022, an increase of 1.8 percent year over year. Verizon Consumer reported 78,000 Fios Video net losses in first-quarter 2022.Prepaid ARPU in the quarter was $30.89 across all of Verizon Consumer's prepaid brands. This decline over first-quarter 2021 results was driven, in part, by pressure in the TracFone brands, though prepaid ARPU is expected to stabilize and subsequently grow sequentially as we execute our strategy to bring additional value to our customers.In first-quarter 2022, Verizon Consumer operating income was $7.3 billion, a decrease of 2.7 percent year over year, and segment operating income margin was 28.9 percent, a decrease from 33 percent in first-quarter 2021. Segment EBITDA1 for the quarter grew 1.0 percent, driven by the inclusion of TracFone results, as well as ARPA and customer volume gains, partially offset by the elevated marketing expenses related to the 5G Ultra campaign, investments in TracFone, and higher bad debt, driven in part by the additional sales volumes in the quarter. Segment EBITDA margin1 of 41.4 percent was impacted by significantly higher equipment revenue and the inclusion of TracFone.Verizon Business resultsTotal Verizon Business revenues were $7.7 billion in first-quarter 2022, down 0.9 percent year over year. Ongoing legacy wireline declines continue to offset Wireless revenue growth. \u00a0Verizon Business wireless service revenues were $3.1 billion, an increase of 2.1 percent, driven by momentum in the SMB market, which continues to see strong post pandemic recovery.\u00a0Verizon Business reported 395,000 wireless retail postpaid net additions in first-quarter 2022, including 256,000 phone net additions. This was the best quarterly phone net addition performance for Business since Verizon 2.0 reporting began.Verizon Business wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.34 percent in first-quarter 2022, and wireless retail postpaid phone churn was 1.06 percent.Verizon Business reported 82,000 Fixed Wireless net additions for the quarter, up substantially from the prior quarter. The flexibility, reliability and value of the product have generated an elevated demand and competitive wins within this space. \u00a0In first-quarter 2022, Verizon Business operating income was $673 million, a decrease of 25.1 percent year over year, and segment operating income margin was 8.7 percent, a decrease from 11.6 percent in first-quarter 2021. Segment EBITDA1 was $1.7 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 9.3 percent, driven in part by the loss of high margin wireline revenue. Segment EBITDA margin1 was 22.5 percent, a decrease from 24.6 percent in first-quarter 2021.\u00a0Outlook and guidance\u00a0For 2022, Verizon is updating its prior guidance for service and other revenue which is now expected to be approximately flat compared to 2021.\u00a0Additionally, Verizon expects the following results for full-year 2022:Reported wireless service revenue growth at the lower end of the previously guided range of 9 percent to 10 percent.Adjusted EBITDA1 growth at the lower end of the previously guided range of 2 percent to 3 percent.Adjusted EPS1 at the lower end of the previously guided range of $5.40 to $5.55.\u00a0Adjusted effective income tax rate1 in the range of 23 percent to 25 percent.Capital spending, excluding C-Band, in the range of $16.5 billion to $17.5 billion.
