Information\n\n\r\nAdobe continues to provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but believes evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Adobe's operating results. Adobe believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management.\r\n\n\r\nAdobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information as well as non-GAAP measures, which may exclude items such as stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles, investment gains and losses, the related tax impact of all of these items, income tax adjustments, and the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Adobe uses these non-GAAP measures in order to assess the performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods. Whenever such a non-GAAP measure is used, Adobe provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above.\r\n\n\n\n\n \nInvestor Relations Contact \r\n\nJonathan Vaas\r\nAdobe\r\nir@adobe.com\n\nPublic Relations Contact \r\n\nAshley Levine\r\nAdobe\r\naslevine@adobe.com Source: Adobe\n","1":"\nSAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- \r\nAdobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) today announced changes to the company\u2019s executive team.\r\n\n\r\nAnil Chakravarthy, executive vice president and general manager, Digital Experience Business and Worldwide Field Operations, has been promoted to President of Adobe\u2019s Digital Experience business and David Wadhwani, chief business officer and executive vice president, Digital Media, has been promoted to President of Adobe\u2019s Digital Media business.

Online prices hit a record high\u00a0at a 3.5%\u00a0year-over-year (YoY) increase while prices are down 2% month-over-month (MoM) due to holiday discounts. This is the highest YoY increase since Adobe first began tracking the digital economy in 2014, and it marks the 18th consecutive month of YoY online inflation. Apparel was a standout category with prices up 17.3% YoY and down just 0.4% MoM, reaching a record high of inflation. One dollar out of every four dollars* is now spent online in the U.S., making the digital economy a significant component of the overall economy.\r\n\n\n\n(Graphic: Business Wire)\n\n\r\nThe Adobe Digital Price Index (DPI) provides the most comprehensive view into how much consumers are paying for goods online. The DPI covers more than 100 million products in the U.S. and is modeled after the Consumer Price Index issued by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The DPI is updated monthly and covers 18 product categories: electronics, apparel, appliances, books, toys, computers, groceries, furniture\/bedding, tools\/home improvement, home\/garden, pet products, jewelry, medical equipment\/supplies, sporting goods, personal care products, flowers\/related gifts, nonprescription drugs and office supplies.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCensus Bureau data shows that the e-commerce share of non-fuel retail spending has tripled over the last decade as more expenditures like groceries and home improvement move online,\u201d said economist Marshall Reinsdorf, former senior economist at International Monetary Fund. \"Measures of digital economy prices have a growing role to play in how we understand inflation, and the Adobe Digital Price Index provides a timely pulse on this important part of the cost-of-living picture that complements indicators like the Consumer Price Index.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOngoing supply chain constraints and durable consumer demand have underpinned the record high inflation in e-commerce, with apparel seeing high volumes of out-of-stock messages online compared to other categories,\u201d said Patrick Brown, vice president of growth marketing and insights, Adobe. \u201cWith offline prices surging in the Consumer Price Index, however, it is still cheaper to shop online for categories such as toys, computers and sporting goods.\u201d\r\n\n\nNotable Categories in the Adobe Digital Price Index (November 2021)\n\n\r\nIn November 2021, 11 of the 18 categories tracked by the Adobe Digital Price Index saw YoY price increases. Apparel prices rose faster than any other category, while price drops were observed in seven categories: electronics, personal care products, office supplies, jewelry, books, toys and computers. On a MoM basis, all but four categories (groceries, pet products, tools\/home improvement and medical equipment\/supplies) saw prices decrease as holiday discounts kicked in.\r\n\n\n\nApparel: Prices are up 17.3% YoY and down 0.4% MoM. Since 2014, only three months (August 2016, January 2020, February 2020) saw apparel prices rise online by 9% or more YoY. For the past eight consecutive months, online prices for the category have risen by over 9% YoY every month.\r\n\n\n\n\nGroceries: Prices are up 3.9% YoY and up 0.6% MoM. Online prices have risen on an annual basis for 22 months, moving in lock step with the Consumer Price Index, which captures prices that consumers are paying for groceries in physical stores.\r\n\n\n\n\nElectronics: Prices are down 0.4% YoY and down 4.0% MoM. Historically (2015\u20132019), prices were down 9.06% YoY on average for the category, which includes gaming consoles, mobile devices, televisions and wearables. On Cyber Monday 2021, consumers paid more for electronics compared to years past, with price drops in the 12% range versus 27% range.\r\n\n\n\n\nAppliances: Prices are up 4% YoY and down 2.7% MoM. The category has seen 19 consecutive months of online inflation on an annual basis. After hitting a low point in December 2019 (prices down 4.6% YoY), prices began rising by May 2020 (up 0.2% YoY) and hit its peak in December 2020 (up 7.1% YoY).\r\n\n\n\n\nToys: Prices are down 2.9% YoY and down 3.6% MoM. It is one of few categories where pricing trends follow a historical pattern of persistent, stronger deflation. (Books and computers follow a similar trend). On Cyber Monday 2021, toys was the only category where price drops were greater than last season, in the 22% range versus 19% range.\r\n\n\n\nMethodology\n\n\r\nThe DPI is modeled after the Consumer Price Index, published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and uses the Fisher Price Index to track online prices. The Fisher Ideal Price Index uses quantities of matched products purchased in the current period (month) and a previous period (previous month) to calculate the price changes by category. Adobe\u2019s analysis is weighted by the real quantities of the products purchased in the two adjacent months.\r\n\n\r\nPowered by Adobe Analytics, the DPI analyzes 1 trillion visits to retail sites and over 100 million SKUs in 18 product categories. Adobe uses a combination of Adobe Sensei, Adobe\u2019s AI and machine learning framework, and manual effort to segment the products into the categories defined by the CPI manual. The methodology was first developed alongside renowned economists Austan Goolsbee and Pete Klenow.\r\n\n\n* Adobe expects $1 in $4 will be spent online during the 2021 holiday shopping season (Nov. 1 to Dec. 31), indexed to the National Retail Federation\u2019s (NRF) total retail forecast that includes in-store sales.\n\n\nAbout Adobe\n\n\r\nAdobe is changing the world through digital experiences.

It has launched careers in fields from data science and product management, to consulting and marketing. Teams from universities and colleges around the world are given several weeks to analyze real data provided by a brand partner and tasked to help the organization solve a pressing business challenge. Using Adobe Analytics, the same customer analytics tool used by Fortune 500 companies, students learn to produce actionable insights that can drive their recommendations.This year, Adobe has partnered with The Walt Disney Company for the Adobe Analytics Challenge 2021, and students will be asked to dig into their e-commerce strategy. As an organization, Disney is a leading international family entertainment and media enterprise with an expansive portfolio that covers everything from theme parks and film studios, to direct-to-consumer streaming services, consumer products and much more. Over the years, its digital audience has grown substantially, as customers go online to research, get inspired and transact. The central theme of the Challenge this year will be around nurturing loyalty online, with insights that can better profile customer intent.Teams will have to present ideas that ultimately help Disney deliver a magical experience online. Students will deliver recommendations on how to drive repeat and multiple purchases online, for instance, and also be asked to conduct a deep analysis of the online shopping cart.

Lastly, teams will be asked to analyze the customer journey across mobile and desktop channels, uncovering new ways for Disney to approach these properties.\u201cAs a global brand that leverages technology of all kinds in support of storytelling, Disney is excited to assist with efforts to help advance educational opportunities for college students around the world interested in this career path,\u201d said Michael DeCook, vice president, Digital & Travel Operations Analytics. \u201cThe Adobe Analytics Challenge will provide real-world experience in digital data analytics and help pave the way for a great future in this dynamic field.\u201dAdobe unveiled the finalist teams today.

Frame.io\u2019s cloud-native platform is a secure and elegant way to gather feedback from everyone involved in the video production process and will enable every stakeholder to effectively contribute to the creative process.\r\n\n\n\nPhotoshop (Beta) and Illustrator (Private Beta) on the web\n: Browser-based experiences where millions of individuals, teams and stakeholders can view, share and comment on cloud documents on the web. Collaborators with a Photoshop subscription can make quick edits and retouch\/adjust images, while Illustrator subscribers can access essential design tools and editing workflows using a set of early features.\r\n\n\n\nCreative Cloud Spaces (Private Beta)\n\n: A digital space built to fuel collaboration among teams, Creative Cloud Spaces simplifies decision-making by putting everything they need in one place. This includes project files, libraries and external links so everyone on the team has universal access to drive creative projects from start to finish. Spaces will be accessible across desktop and mobile through Creative Cloud Web and available in Photoshop, Illustrator, Fresco and XD.\r\n\n\n\nCreative Cloud Canvas (Private Beta)\n: To unlock a new level of collaboration, Canvases enable teams to lay out, visualize and review creative work together, in real time, without ever leaving the browser. On a Canvas, teams can place shapes, text, images and stickers, as well as linked documents from Creative Cloud apps, so anyone can make quick edits to the original creative in the corresponding app with a single click.\r\n\n\n\r\nIn addition, an all-new Workfront plugin for Photoshop gives creatives the ability to collaborate in context. Through an embedded Workfront update screen in Photoshop, creators can see tasks and issues, and post and view comments related to the project they\u2019re working on.\r\n\n\nEmpowering Creative Careers\n\n\r\nAdobe is supporting creators by enabling Creative Cloud subscribers to monetize their work through paid subscriptions on the Behance platform. Creators have full control over what they share, and the subscriptions are seamlessly integrated into Behance projects and livestreams, so creators can reserve any content for subscribers only. Creators keep 100% of their subscription revenue, with a 0% platform fee charged by Adobe.\r\n\n\nCombating Misinformation: The Content Authenticity Initiative\n\n\r\nTwo years after introducing the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), Adobe is making its content attribution technology available to millions of customers. Through a CAI-driven feature called Content Credentials, attribution capabilities are now available in Photoshop, enabling users to turn on the opt-in feature to share content provenance details about their images; these include the creator\u2019s identity, edits they\u2019ve made and the time and place the photo was taken.\r\n\n\r\nTo ensure creators are getting credit for their work, the company is connecting the Content Credentials feature to NFT marketplaces for further attribution. Lastly, Adobe Stock will also automatically attach Content Credentials to images when they are downloaded.\r\n\n\nCelebration of Creativity for All\n\n\r\nAdobe MAX showcases a diverse roster of highly prolific creatives and entrepreneurs, including Jose Andres, Riz Ahmed, Zazie Beetz, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, Henry Golding, Casey Neistat, Tilda Swinton, Young Thug, Chloe Zhao and Imagine Dragons. Emmy Award-winning comedian and producer Kenan Thompson will host this year\u2019s MAX Sneaks \u2013 a behind-the-scenes look at the experimental technology being developed in Adobe Labs.\r\n\n\r\nMAX offers more than 400 content sessions and Labs, and 29 hours of global content designed to inspire and educate.

The combination of Adobe\u2019s leading video editing offerings\u2014including Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe After Effects\u2014with Frame.io\u2019s cloud-based review and approval functionality will radically accelerate the creative process and deliver an end-to-end video platform.\n\n\nThe skyrocketing demand for video means video teams must create an ever-increasing volume of content in close collaboration with dispersed stakeholders. Today, video review and approval processes are disjointed across multiple channels, leading to inefficient, time-intensive workflows. To address these inefficiencies, video tools need to be cloud-first with collaboration at the center, enabling every stakeholder to effectively contribute to the creative process with the appropriate controls, feedback mechanisms, and security.\n\n\nWith over a million users, Frame.io streamlines the video production process by enabling editors and key project stakeholders to seamlessly collaborate using cloud-first workflows. The addition of Frame.io creates an opportunity for Adobe, in conjunction with the partner ecosystem, to expand beyond video editors to a broader set of customers, teams and enterprises.\n\n\n\u201cWith the growing importance of video, we\u2019re proud to add Frame.io\u2019s industry-leading, cloud-native workflow capabilities to Creative Cloud,\u201d said Scott Belsky, chief product officer and executive vice president, Creative Cloud. \u201cWe are committed to enabling collaboration beyond Adobe\u2019s applications to the growing number of third-party applications across the creative ecosystem, many of which Frame.io supports.\u201d\n\n\nNow that the acquisition is complete, Adobe together with Frame.io will make the creative process more collaborative, productive and efficient to further unleash creativity for all:\n\n\n\nThe acquisition of Frame.io brings Adobe Creative Cloud\u2019s collaboration services to video and will make it easy for teams to collaborate across Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and other Adobe Creative Cloud applications.\n\n\nAll Creative Cloud customers will benefit from seamless collaboration on video projects with Frame.io workflow functionality built natively in Adobe Creative Cloud apps like Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects and Adobe Photoshop.\n\n\nWith the addition of Frame.io, Adobe will continue to collaborate across all stakeholders of creativity beyond Adobe\u2019s applications that includes third-party applications in the entire creative ecosystem.\n\n\n\nWith the close of the transaction, Frame.io co-founder and CEO Emery Wells will continue to lead the Frame.io team, reporting to Scott Belsky as part of the Creative Cloud organization.\n\n\nForward-Looking Statements Disclosure\n\n\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities law.

Non-GAAP Financial Information\n\n\r\nAdobe continues to provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but believes evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Adobe's operating results. Adobe believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management.\r\n\n\r\nAdobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information as well as non-GAAP measures, which may exclude items such as stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles, investment gains and losses, the related tax impact of all of these items, income tax adjustments, and the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Adobe uses these non-GAAP measures in order to assess the performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods. Whenever such a non-GAAP measure is used, Adobe provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above.\r\n\n\n\n\n \nInvestor Relations Contact\n\n\r\nJonathan Vaas\r\nAdobe\r\nir@adobe.com\n\nPublic Relations Contact\n\n\r\nAshley Levine\r\nAdobe\r\naslevine@adobe.com Source: Adobe\n","13":"\nSAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- \r\nAdobe (Nasdaq: ADBE) today announced the upcoming availability of Payment Services for Adobe Commerce, the industry\u2019s leading end-to-end commerce application for B2B, D2C and hybrid use cases. By integrating Payment Services to their digital storefronts, Adobe merchants of all sizes will soon have access to a robust, secure, and integrated payment solution that can easily be managed from their Adobe Commerce Admin, instead of having to do the work of integrating with third-party payment providers. Payment Services for Adobe Commerce will be powered by the PayPal Commerce Platform and available to Adobe merchants by the end of the year.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn today\u2019s fast-moving digital economy, organizations demand flexibility and extensibility in their commerce platform to sustain business growth and deliver seamless experiences for their customers,\u201d said Amit Ahuja, vice president, Adobe Experience Cloud Product and Strategy at Adobe. \u201cWith the addition of Payment Services, we\u2019re thrilled to expand on our already robust out-of-the-box commerce feature set to help Adobe Commerce merchants compete effectively and win in the digital-first economy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMerchant benefits of Payment Services for Adobe Commerce will include:\r\n\n\n\nEasily Accept and Process Payment Methods: With Payment Services, Adobe merchants will be able to accept popular payment methods, including credit and debit cards, PayPal and Venmo to deliver the best checkout experience for their customers. In addition, merchants will also be able to offer PayPal pay later solutions in their storefront. According to Adobe Digital Economy Index, the use of buy now, pay later (BNPL) services in the first half of 2021 grew 88% compared to 2019 levels.\r\n\n\nFully-Integrated Payment Experience: Payment Services will be a fully-integrated experience for merchants in which all payment and transaction data will be readily accessible within the Adobe Commerce Admin. Merchants will no longer have to contend with multiple logins and other disjointed user experiences for their payment processing, such as exporting and importing reports from multiple systems to reconcile, analyze, and verify sales information.\r\n\n\nCompetitive Processing Fees: Merchants will have access to convenient and competitive pricing for transactions with tiered rates based on processing volume.\r\n\n\nAdvanced Financial Reporting Capability: Payment Services will offer comprehensive reporting capabilities to provide merchants with a clear view of their store\u2019s orders and payments, including details about processed volume, payment balance and transaction-level reporting for financial reconciliation. With this reporting, merchants will be able to better run their business and spot anomalies in order placements and post-sales flows more efficiently. In addition, merchants will be able to see the complete order flow from when an order is placed, all the way to settlement in a single dashboard.\r\n\n\nAlways Up-to-Date and Secure: As Payment Services will be developed and supported by Adobe, merchants will always have access to services that are up-to-date, safe, and stable. Merchants won\u2019t have to deal with third-party payment processor extension compatibility issues when updating to the latest version of Adobe Commerce.\r\n\n\n\r\nBy utilizing the PayPal Commerce Platform, Adobe merchants will be able to accept current payment methods \u2013 such as PayPal and Venmo \u2013 as well as leverage PayPal\u2019s ongoing investment in payment innovations such as support for cryptocurrency transactions and local payment methods in the future.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs digital commerce represents a growing share of all transactions, merchants are looking for tools that enable them to drive front-end capabilities and back-end operations of their digital storefronts. Payments is one of those key capabilities that we saw grow in importance over the past 18 months,\u201d said Jordan Jewell, research director, digital commerce at IDC. \u201cWith payment capabilities now in its product portfolio, Adobe is better-positioned to support its merchants as a platform provider that can streamline commerce operations across the customer journey.\u201d\r\n\n\nTiming and Availability \n\n\r\nPayment Services will be available to merchants in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2021. The feature will also be accessible to merchants using Magento Open Source.\r\n\n\r\nSupport for additional territories, including Canada, Australia, and Western Europe, are planned for 2022.\r\n\n\r\nFor more information about Payment Services, visit here.\r\n\n\nAbout Adobe \n\n\r\nAdobe is changing the world through digital experiences.

As part of the next generation of the Adobe Education Exchange, college instructors and students will be able to use Adobe Analytics\u2014the industry-leading customer data analytics platform\u2014for free and get access to course curriculum with hands-on activities. Students will learn how to use data to drive business decisions and gain skills for careers spanning data science to marketing and product management. The program is an extension of the Adobe Creative Campus program, which advances digital literacy through access to Adobe Creative Cloud in the classroom.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAdobe is driving digital transformation for major brands in every sector, and the one thing we consistently hear is how difficult it is to hire the right talent,\u201d said Amit Ahuja, vice president, Experience Cloud Platform and Products at Adobe. \u201cDigital literacy is paramount for students in today\u2019s digital economy, and this program meets the needs of today\u2019s employers while exposing students to careers they may not have considered.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe program was developed through the Adobe Analytics Challenge, which launched in 2005. The popular competition gives college students a chance to work with real data to solve business challenges, from companies such as Nike, Major League Baseball and Sony Playstation. Past participants have used the experience to land careers at The Home Depot, Boston Consulting Group, Amazon and nonprofits like Learning Forward. The success of the event drove interest from higher education instructors, who wanted to include elements of the Challenge in their coursework.\r\n\n\r\nProfessors from institutions including the University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of Utah and University of Michigan partnered with Adobe to develop the curriculum, helping shape the program to ensure it is easy to implement among any college or university.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe pandemic reshaped economies and exposed consumers to a digital-only reality, pushing organizations to transform themselves on a dime and seek new types of talent,\u201d said Neeraj Arora, professor of marketing, University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cThe digital skills that students can acquire through Adobe\u2019s program will greatly help them succeed in career fields such as marketing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe ability to deliver great digital experiences is absolutely crucial for corporations, government agencies and small businesses alike,\u201d said Paul Hu, David Eccles chair professor, the University of Utah. \u201cData is a valuable asset in today\u2019s digital economy, and Adobe Analytics curriculum for education will play a major role in helping students acquire skillsets that significantly broaden their career opportunities and development.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe program has four core modules that can be incorporated into any curriculum. Participants get access to a sandbox environment, which allows students to use Adobe Analytics with rich demo data. It is meant to be self-paced, and instructors can pick and choose any of the modules to incorporate into their coursework. The modules focus on:\r\n\n\n\nData Collection: Organizations have to connect data from different sources and across departments such as marketing, customer service, sales, human resources and more \u2013 all of which require proper governance and privacy controls. In this module, students will learn the fundamentals of data collection, warehousing and cleaning, as well as implementation.\r\n\n\nData Strategy and Architecture: Once data is collected, teams have to set up a data structure to make the data consumable across an organization. Students can combine metrics across consumer touchpoints, for instance, to understand how promotional offers online drive in-store foot traffic. It also gives students a chance to define key performance indicators and shape how goals are structured and achieved.\r\n\n\nStandard Metrics and Functionality: This module focuses on reporting and how data is presented to an organization at large, spanning functions such as marketing, product development, eCommerce and design. Students will continue to layer meaning into numbers and showcase how insights can drive real action.\r\n\n\nAnalysis Workspace Fundamentals: Analysis Workspace is a unique drag-and-drop interface in Adobe Analytics. Inspired by Photoshop, users can curate different data sets and take on a detective role in uncovering data anomalies and other insights. This module provides students an opportunity to curate data, collaborate with others, produce new visualizations and uncover insights that advance business objectives.\r\n\n\n\r\nTo register for the Adobe Analytics curriculum for education, visit here.\r\n\n\nAbout Adobe \n\n\r\nAdobe is changing the world through digital experiences.

Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: failure to compete effectively, failure to develop, acquire, market and offer products and services that meet customer requirements, introduction of new technology, information security and privacy, potential interruptions or delays in hosted services provided by us or third parties, macroeconomic conditions and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, risks associated with cyber-attacks, complex sales cycles, risks related to the timing of revenue recognition from our subscription offerings, fluctuations in subscription renewal rates, failure to realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, failure to effectively manage critical strategic third-party business relationships, changes in accounting principles and tax regulations, uncertainty in the financial markets and economic conditions in the countries where we operate, and other various risks associated with being a multinational corporation. For a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties, please refer to Adobe\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year 2020 ended Nov. 27, 2020, and Adobe's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q issued in fiscal year 2021.\r\n\n\r\nThe financial information set forth in this press release reflects estimates based on information available at this time.

evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Adobe's operating results. Adobe believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management.\r\n\n\r\nAdobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information as well as non-GAAP measures, which may exclude items such as stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles, investment gains and losses, the related tax impact of all of these items, income tax adjustments, and the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Adobe uses these non-GAAP measures in order to assess the performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods. Whenever such a non-GAAP measure is used, Adobe provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above.\r\n\n\n\n\n \nExhibit 99.1 \r\n\n\nInvestor Relations Contact \r\n\nJonathan Vaas\r\nAdobe\r\nir@adobe.com \r\nPublic Relations Contact \r\nAshley Levine\r\nAdobe\r\naslevine@adobe.com Source: Adobe\n","18":"\nSAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- \r\nAdobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) today announced the appointment of David Wadhwani as executive vice president and chief business officer, Digital Media.

The unprecedented environment has forced the world to quickly transition to a digital-first economy as digital has become the main way for people to connect, work, learn, and be entertained. Global commerce continues to see record-breaking growth with $876 billion in the first three months of 2021 (up 38% YoY) and $4.2 trillion expected for the year.

Award-winning writer, actor, and director Dan Levy will go behind the scenes of Adobe\u2019s groundbreaking innovation as the host of \u201cSneaks.\u201d To watch the keynotes, explore the more than 400 sessions, network with peers, or speak live with an Adobe expert, visit the Summit web experience.\n\r\n\u201cThe pandemic has shown that brands that put a laser focus on customer experience management come out in front,\u201d said Anil Chakravarthy, executive vice president and general manager, Digital Experience Business and Worldwide Field Operations, Adobe. \u201cAdobe Experience Cloud with its new innovations released today is bringing businesses closer to their customers\u2014enabling them to deliver the best digital experiences at speed and scale.\u201d\r\n\n\nAdobe Experience Platform Momentum\n\n\r\nWithout strong data management, companies lack an effective approach to connect with customers in real-time. Adobe Experience Platform, at the heart of Adobe Experience Cloud, allows customers to collect disparate data from across the enterprise, enrich that data with actionable customer insights, and stitch data together for more complete, real-time customer profiles so that every experience is better than the last. Today, Adobe Experience Platform powers Adobe Experience Cloud applications and delivers real-time personalization at scale with more than 17 trillion audience segment evaluations every day.\r\n\n\nNew Innovations in Adobe Experience Cloud \n\n\r\nAdobe Experience Cloud, which is used by 75% of Fortune 100 companies today, is powering Customer Experience Management (CXM) for B2B and B2C companies with applications focused on customer journey management, data insights and audiences, content and personalization, commerce and marketing workflows. Innovations to help businesses accelerate their digital transformation include:\r\n\n\n\nNew Adobe Journey Optimizer: Consumers want to connect in a way that feels personalized and relevant throughout their unique journey, but brands struggle with providing context-aware experiences in real-time, at scale. The new Adobe Journey Optimizer, built on Adobe Experience Platform, is the industry\u2019s only enterprise application designed to help marketers optimize the customer journey across any outbound or inbound customer touchpoint. Brands can now actively listen to customer signals and use intelligent decisioning to anticipate and deliver the most relevant journey at scale by bringing together audience-based outbound marketing with one-on-one engagement.\r\n\n\nNext Generation Adobe Real-time CDP:With consumers becoming increasingly attentive to what type of data they are willing to share and third-party cookies in browsers going away, quality first-party data is the best way for marketers to build trusted relationships with customers. Adobe\u2019s next generation Real-time CDP is the only enterprise application architected from the ground up for first-party, data-driven customer acquisition and engagement. And, available today, the B2B edition of Adobe Real-time CDP allows customers to bring together both individual and account profiles for complete intelligence and activation to help B2B companies think and act like B2C brands.\r\n\n\nNew Customer Journey Analytics: Successful enterprises need a data-driven approach to know their customers and to continuously optimize engagement in a way that ensures each experience is better than the last. New Customer Journey Analytics is the industry\u2019s first enterprise application that allows brands to integrate and standardize their online and offline customer data, enabling anyone\u2014not just data scientists\u2014to connect that data, easily visualize it in a unified view, and better understand the entire journey to better inform marketing strategies.\r\n\n\nNew Marketing System of Record: Work management solutions must help companies run more efficiently by centralizing work in a single application, so cross-functional teams can connect, collaborate, and execute the right work\u2014from anywhere. Following Adobe\u2019s acquisition of Workfront, Adobe previewed its new Marketing System of Record, which will be the single source of truth for connecting and managing work across the entire marketing lifecycle, from strategy and planning to execution and measurement.\r\n\n\nNew Adobe Experience Manager Innovations: New innovations within Adobe Experience Manager help brands create, manage and optimize the content businesses require at the velocity needed to stay ahead. This includes Headless Content Management System (CMS) capabilities, which deliver immersive content as data over APIs and bring advanced AI to content automation. The new Adobe Experience Manager Assets Essentials will become the default asset management capability in all Adobe Experience Cloud applications and be fully configurable to ensure access to the best content.\r\n\n\nNew Adobe Commerce Capabilities: Companies are increasingly relying on digital commerce as the dominant channel to drive business growth. Powered by Adobe Sensei, Product Recommendations in Adobe Commerce unlock new ways for customers to discover products and Live Search delivers fast and hyper-relevant results and search experiences on the merchant\u2019s site. A new collaboration with FedEx will let Adobe Commerce merchants integrate their storefronts with FedEx ShopRunner, allowing them to offer consumer benefits such as free two-day shipping, seamless checkout, easy returns, and the ability to access FedEx post-purchase logistics intelligence.\r\n\n\nNew Adobe Experience Platform Collection Enterprise:Companies need access to real-time consumer behavioral data to drive decisions that impact real-time experiences at scale. Collecting behavioral data is cumbersome, difficult to manage, and traditional approaches often lead to poor application performance, negatively impacting the consumer experience. New Collection Enterprise allows companies to use Adobe\u2019s globally distributed, high-performance edge network for collecting data and sending it wherever it needs to go, whether that be to Adobe\u2019s applications and platform or any other system. And the new lightweight data collection SDKs help ensure that applications are highly performant to provide the best consumer experience.\r\n\n\n\nAbout Adobe \n\n\r\nAdobe is changing the world through digital experiences.

Adobe Real-time CDP helps brands activate known and unknown customer data to manage the entire customer profile and journey seamlessly in one system, without the need for third-party cookies.\r\n\n\r\nThe relationship between consumers and brands is rapidly evolving. Consumers today are more attentive to the data they share, which has resulted in a patchwork of privacy regulations globally. At the same time, expectations for personalized brand experiences remain at an all-time high, while third-party cookies, which marketers have historically relied on to track unknown visitors, will no longer be supported in browsers. This means brands will have to contend with reduced insight about unknown visitors to their digital properties while still trying to provide a compelling customer experience.\r\n\n\r\nIn light of these changes, it is imperative for companies to recalibrate their customer acquisition strategy to place quality, permission-based first-party data at the center of all their customer engagements. Adopting a first-party data strategy allows them to provide customers with the most relevant, personalized experience by only using the information that customers choose to share. And yet, a recent survey of digital marketers shows that despite optimism around the benefits of first-party data, marketers believe they have tapped only 47% of their first-party data potential.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs consumers, we now expect personalized brand experiences while being in control of the data we share,\u201d said Anil Chakravarthy, executive vice president and general manager, Digital Experience Business and Worldwide Field Operations at Adobe. \u201cWith Adobe Real-time CDP, we are partnering with brands to deliver relevant, responsive and respectful experiences through first-party data.\u201d\r\n\n\nUsing First-Party Data to Power CXM\n\n\n\nA Centralized Hub for First-Party Data: Adobe Real-time CDP serves as a centralized hub for brands to bring together varying types of first-party event and attribute data to form a more complete view of their customers. It allows brands to combine first-party web, app and media data (from publishers) coming from interactions such as a prospect\u2019s web browsing activity, as well as emails or phone numbers from customers who opt to register on a brand\u2019s site. As additional data is added and richer customer profiles are built, brands can use Adobe Target to personalize experiences. In addition, out-of-box data governance capabilities help brands ensure that data usage policies are strictly enforced and followed by everyone in an organization.\r\n\n\n\n\nReal-Time, Machine-Learning Powered Personalization at Scale: Encouraging an unknown visitor to register on a brand\u2019s site with their email or phone number can be a challenge. There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach as every customer\u2019s journey is different. As Adobe Real-time CDP allows brands to build a prospect\u2019s profile based on brand interactions, Adobe Target ingests available data and orchestrates in real-time the next best content, offer or experience, including identifying the right moment in between clicks to trigger registration and consent from the unknown visitor. In addition, Adobe Target allows brands to bring prospects\u2019 propensity scores (the likelihood that a visitor will perform certain actions like a purchase) from Adobe Real-time CDP into Adobe Target to deliver relevant experiences that will likely turn a prospect into a customer.\r\n\n\n\n\nSegment Match: New Segment Match lets brands collaborate to expand their own first-party data sets through partnerships. It allows marketers to securely enrich their matching first-party profiles with segment metadata for better insights and improved personalization. For example, an apparel retailer may partner with a jewelry brand to exchange non-sensitive segment data about their matching customers, like the type of dresses that a subset of their customers is buying so that the jewelry brand can recommend accessories for those groups. The non-sensitive customer data can only be referenced in Segment Match when the customers for both the apparel retailer and the jewelry brand permit them.\r\n\n\n\n\nLook-Alike Segments: New Look-alike Segments allow brands to identify additional customers who share similar attributes to their best-known customers. For example, using a sample audience of existing customers, marketers can build a look-alike segment that consists of other customers within the brand\u2019s database who share comparable traits. Another way to use Look-alike Segments is in tandem with Segment Match. In this instance, a brand can identify and send a sample audience of existing customers to a Segment Match partner. Based on the data, the partner can build a look-alike segment that consists of other customers within the partner\u2019s own database who share similar characteristics and have granted permission for the partner to use their data.\r\n\n\n\n\nNew B2B CDP Capabilities: In today\u2019s increasingly digital economy, B2B companies must find new ways to connect with customers across an ever-expanding set of touchpoints in a personalized, relevant way and do it at scale. Available today, the B2B edition of Adobe Real-time CDP brings together both individual and account profiles for complete intelligence and activation to help B2B companies think and act like B2C brands.\r\n\n\n\r\n\u201cNo customer experience initiative will be successful without a data infrastructure to support it,\u201d said Gerry Murray, research director, marketing and sales technology at IDC. \u201cCustomers expect brands to act as one regardless of where, when, how or with whom they interact. The only way to do that is by making customer data an enterprise service free from application and departmental silos with a solution like Adobe\u2019s Real-time CDP.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe preservation of our customers\u2019 privacy has long been a priority for IBM,\" said Jason Andrews, vice president for digital marketing at IBM. \"With first-party data rising in importance in this new era, we place tremendous value on our close collaboration with strategic partners such as Adobe to put the interests of consumers at the forefront of what we do.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs a customer-obsessed company, we recognize the vital role that first-party data plays in helping to contextualize our customers\u2019 journeys to ultimately deliver a winning brand experience,\u201d said Josh Rab, vice president, marketing technology at Intuit. \u201cIntuit has been a long-standing Adobe customer, and we\u2019re excited to extend this partnership as we ramp up our data strategy and raise the bar for the type of brand experience that Intuit offers.\u201d\r\n\n\nSupporting Resources\n\n\n\r\nIntroducing Adobe Real-time Customer Data Platform\n\nLearn more about how Adobe is helping brands reach customers in a cookieless future\n\r\nCheck out this report from Forrester Research: \u201cGet Your Data Deprecation Plan Together\u201d\r\n\n\n\nAbout Adobe\r\nAdobe is changing the world through digital experiences.

Dr. Geschke passed away on Friday, surrounded by his family.\r\n\n\r\nDr. Geschke co-founded Adobe in 1982 with Dr. John Warnock, a colleague from Xerox. Their first product was Adobe PostScript, a pivotal technology that sparked the desktop publishing revolution. Dr. Geschke was chief operating officer of Adobe from December 1986 to July 1994 and president from April 1989 until his retirement in April 2000. He served as chairman of the board with Dr. Warnock from September 1997 to January 2017 and a member of the board until April 2020, when he transitioned to become emeritus board member. In recognition of his technical achievements, Dr. Geschke was awarded the prestigious National Medal of Technology and Innovation, the Computer Entrepreneur Award from the IEEE Computer Society, and the American Electronics Association Medal of Honor.\r\n\n\r\nDr. Warnock, Adobe co-founder, former CEO and Chairman of the Board, shared the following: \u201cI could never have imagined having a better, more likable, or more capable business partner. Not having Chuck in our lives will leave a huge hole and those who knew him will all agree.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAdobe CEO Shantanu Narayen sent the following email to all Adobe employees:\r\n\n\nIt is with profound sadness that I share that our beloved co-founder Dr. Chuck Geschke, has passed away at the age of 81, leaving an indelible mark on our company and the world. \n\n\nThis is a huge loss for the entire Adobe community and the technology industry, for whom he has been a guide and hero for decades. \n\n\nAs co-founders of Adobe, Chuck and John Warnock developed groundbreaking software that has revolutionized how people create and communicate. Their first product was Adobe PostScript, an innovative technology that provided a radical new way to print text and images on paper and sparked the desktop publishing revolution. Chuck instilled a relentless drive for innovation in the company, resulting in some of the most transformative software inventions, including the ubiquitous PDF, Acrobat, Illustrator, Premiere Pro and Photoshop. \n\n\nIn recognition of his technical achievements, Chuck was awarded the prestigious National Medal of Technology and Innovation, the Computer Entrepreneur Award from the IEEE Computer Society, and the American Electronics Association Medal of Honor. After 18 years sharing the helm of Adobe, Chuck retired in 2000 and continued to serve on the Board of Directors until last year, when he transitioned to become emeritus board member.\n\n\nAs much as his inventions changed the world, it is his focus on people, purpose and culture that has profoundly impacted each of us at Adobe. As he always said, Chuck wanted to create a company where he would want to work. He believed that good ideas come from everywhere in the company and that it\u2019s not only what we do but how we do it that matters most. He dedicated much of his time and talent to various philanthropies and community organizations throughout his lifetime. \n\n\nI spoke to John earlier today and he had this to share about their five-decade partnership: \u201cIn 1982, Chuck and I agreed that we should leave Xerox and start our own company. That was the beginning of Adobe. I could never have imagined having a better, more likable, or more capable business partner. Not having Chuck in our lives will leave a huge hole and those who knew him will all agree.\u201d\n\n\nI admired his brilliance, kindness and values that defined his character and am grateful that I had the privilege to know and work with him. His absence will certainly leave a huge hole in my heart. \n\n\nAs I grieve the loss of my long-time role model, mentor and friend, I am comforted knowing that Adobe\u2019s best days are ahead \u2013 exactly as Chuck would want them to be. \n\n\nShantanu\n\n\r\n-----------\r\n\n\r\nDr. Geschke is survived by his wife Nancy (\u201cNan\u201d) Geschke and his three children.\r\n\n\r\nFor Dr. Geschke\u2019s biography visit: https:\/\/www.adobe.com\/content\/dam\/cc\/en\/leaders\/pdfs\/geschke.pdf\n\nAbout Adobe \n\n\r\nAdobe is changing the world through digital experiences.

evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Adobe's operating results. Adobe believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management.\r\n\n\r\nAdobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information as well as non-GAAP measures, which may exclude items such as stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles, investment gains and losses, the related tax impact of all of these items, income tax adjustments, and the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Adobe uses these non-GAAP measures in order to assess the performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods. Whenever such a non-GAAP measure is used, Adobe provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above.\r\n\n\n\n\n \nInvestor Relations Contact \r\n\nJonathan Vaas\r\nAdobe\r\nir@adobe.com\n\nPublic Relations Contact \r\n\nAshley Levine\r\nAdobe\r\naslevine@adobe.com Source: Adobe\n","27":"\nSAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- \r\nAdobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) today unveiled it is partnering with government agencies in all 50 states to power their digital modernization through Adobe Experience Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud. The partnerships exist across individual agencies at the state, county and city levels. Using Adobe Experience Cloud, governments are revamping their online presence, making their websites and apps easier to navigate, ensuring content is personalized and updated in real-time, and creating intuitive forms that work on any device. Governments have also adopted Adobe Document Cloud to optimize internal document workflows and Adobe Sign to power the entire e-signature process, reducing time spent on tasks such as applying for benefits, and drastically reducing paper waste.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic greatly accelerated efforts to improve government services online, and popular consumer services now set the bar for experience quality across the board,\u201d said Anil Chakravarthy, executive vice president and general manager, Digital Experience Business and Worldwide Field Operations, Adobe. \u201cThe public sector has unique hurdles from scalability to security, and Adobe\u2019s FedRAMP-authorized solutions are tailored to address them while helping ensure ease-of-use and equitable access for citizens.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe adoption of Adobe tools is also helping government agencies adhere to more sustainable business practices. For example, through resource-free workflows, Adobe Document Cloud turns 30 billion paper documents in the U.S. each year into digital documents.\u00a0\n\r\nAdobe is also sharing an update on its Government Rapid Response Program, first introduced to support continuity during the pandemic when consumers rushed online to access government services. As vaccines ramp up, Adobe supports agencies and companies as they work to accelerate distribution. Adobe tools can be used to streamline enrollment tasks such as eligibility determination, appointment scheduling and personalized reminders, while e-signatures expedite document requests and minimize fraud. And with a greater need to inform the public on vaccine developments and guidance, Adobe can help teams manage and deliver content across web, email, mobile messaging and other channels.\r\n\n\r\nPartnerships with state, county and city agencies include:\r\n\n\n\r\nIn California, Los Angeles County is home to over 10 million residents; one in three people rely on the Department of Public Social Services (DPSS), the largest agency of its kind in the U.S. The agency tapped Adobe Experience Cloud to revamp its website, a digital \u201cfront door\u201d that became crucial when shelter-in-place orders took effect. The new experience is easier to navigate and mobile-friendly.\r\n\n\r\nThe State of Oklahoma partnered with Adobe to drive its web modernization project. A new oklahoma.gov site, powered by Adobe Experience Cloud, became a one-stop shop for any service\u2014from financial assistance to getting a fishing permit. The state is also using Adobe Sign to support its remote workforce with automated e-signatures and digital document processing.\r\n\n\r\nThe State of Iowa, through the Iowa Economic Development Authority (IEDA), has previously awarded over $52.2 million in grant assistance for small businesses. With Adobe Sign, the state quickly received applications and turned around payment distribution. In the first four weeks of the portal going live, roughly 20,000 transactions were completed.\r\n\n\r\nIn California, the City of Sacramento relies on digital channels to engage its half-million residents. Adobe Sign and Adobe Experience Manager Forms provide paperless processes that save constituents time and energy. The city tapped Adobe Campaign to revamp its email program, a key communication channel for COVID-19 updates and more. Through better insights and personalization, the subscriber base has grown by 30%, with an open rate of over 24%.\r\n\n\r\nThe State of Utah enacted a teleworking initiative to drive greater efficiency in its government. With Adobe Sign, employees could work remotely, with less environmental impact than that of paper workflows. During the pandemic, this minimized disruption for residents, with over 2,500 employees quickly transitioning to remote work and accelerating turnaround on over 5,000 documents in an initial 30-day period.\r\n\n\r\nAt the federal level, Adobe Experience Cloud was used by the U.S. Census Bureau to power the delivery, measurement and personalization of the first online Census in 2020. This initiative was recognized at the ATC-IAC Igniting Innovation 2020 Conference and Awards for the \u201cgreatest magnitude of results and benefits,\u201d as the Bureau could save at least $55 million for every 1% increase in digital responses.\r\n\n\r\nAdobe is working with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at a pivotal point in the pandemic, helping the agency understand what constituents are looking for on the CDC website via Adobe Analytics and driving email communications on vaccine guidance and prevention methods through Adobe Campaign.\r\n\n\n\nAdditional Updates \n\n\n\nAdobe Experience Manager Forms as a Cloud Service: Government agencies rely on Adobe Experience Manager to deliver scalable and resilient websites that meet the needs of the public. With the availability of Adobe Experience Manager Forms as a Cloud Service, Adobe is helping further accelerate these digital initiatives. When Adobe first took its creative tools from a boxed software to the cloud, it meant faster access to new features and a high level of security. A cloud-native application will extend the same benefits to government forms. Agencies can deliver an engaging digital forms experience for consumers that is highly scalable, renders beautifully on any device, and integrates with Adobe Sign.\r\n\n\nDigital Government Study: Adobe surveyed more than 1,000 U.S. consumers to better understand how the pandemic impacted government websites and citizen preferences. The study highlights a general desire for more information and direct communication from government agencies, while also showing the impact of digital experiences on consumer sentiment around favorability and trustworthiness.

With the introduction of Frame.io for Creative Cloud, video editors and key project stakeholders \u2013 including producers, agencies and clients \u2013 are able to collaborate seamlessly in the cloud. This is the industry\u2019s first integrated review and approval workflow for post-production, allowing editors to get to final approval faster and easier than ever before. Demand for video collaboration solutions is on the rise in a digital economy where more content is being created than ever before and remote teamwork is becoming the new normal.\r\n\n\r\nNow, as part of a Creative Cloud subscription, video creators can:\r\n\n\n\r\nShare work in progress with an unlimited number of reviewers anywhere in the world.\r\n\n\nGet frame-accurate comments and annotations directly inside of Premiere Pro and After Effects, all without leaving their timeline.\r\n\n\r\nUse Frame.io accelerated file transfer technology for fast uploading and downloading of media with 100GB of dedicated Frame.io storage.\r\n\n\r\nWork on up to five different projects concurrently with another remote user.\r\n\n\r\nWork with Camera to Cloud \u2013 the fastest, easiest and most secure way to get footage from cameras to editors, motion designers and other stakeholders.\r\n\n\n\r\n\u201cThe combination of Premiere Pro and Frame.io gives customers the world\u2019s only end-to-end solution for video creation from ingest to editorial to output,\u201d said Steve Warner, vice president of Digital Video and Audio at Adobe. \u201cThis is the first step toward building a powerful, cloud-based platform for the future of video creation.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNotable filmmakers are already seeing the benefits of remote collaboration with Premiere Pro and Frame.io. A24\u2019s Everything Everywhere All At Once, in theaters now, used the two solutions in their workflow. The film\u2019s editor Paul Rogers stated, \u201cPremiere Pro is wonderful and I couldn\u2019t imagine cutting in any other program. Combined with Frame.io, the whole workflow was very intuitive. I was able to focus on the film, not the tools.\u201d Recent Premiere Pro projects of note include: A24\u2019s After Yangand The Green Knight, the ACADEMY AWARD\u00ae nominated film Ascension,FX\u2019sAtlantaand more.\r\n\n\nNew Updates in After Effects and Premiere Pro to Work Faster and More Efficiently\n\n\r\nThe latest release of the Adobe Creative Cloud video applications is also available starting today, offering new features and workflow refinements that help video pros and social storytellers create compelling content. The updates include:\r\n\n\nAfter Effects:\n\n\n\n\n\nNative M1 Support\n\n\n\n\nnow launches up to seven times faster and renders compositions twice as fast on M1 Macs compared to an Intel 10-core iMac Pro.

In March 2022, online prices increased 3.6%year-over-year (YoY) and 0.3% month-over-month (MoM), matching the record YoY high in February 2022. This marks the 22nd consecutive month of YoY inflation online. In March, prices for apparel increased 16.3% YoY (up 0.3% MoM), more than any other category.\r\n\n\n\nPrice Table (Graphic: Business Wire)\n\n\r\nGrocery prices continued to surge and rose 9.0% YoY (up 1.4% MoM), a new record. Prices for everyday staples including pet products increased 7.0% YoY (up 1.5% MoM), and personal care items increased 1.4% YoY (up 0.1% MoM). Despite higher prices and supply chain challenges that drove 3.1 billion out-of-stock messages in March, demand for e-commerce remained strong. Consumers spent $83.1 billion (up 7% YoY), a significant increase from $67 billion in February, as the digital economy continued to shift to more personalized customer experiences.\r\n\n\r\nThe DPI provides the most comprehensive view into how much consumers pay for goods online. Powered by Adobe Analytics, it analyzes one trillion visits to retail sites and over 100 million SKUs across 18 product categories: electronics, apparel, appliances, books, toys, computers, groceries, furniture\/bedding, tools\/home improvement, home\/garden, pet products, jewelry, medical equipment\/supplies, sporting goods, personal care products, flowers\/related gifts, non-prescription drug and office supplies.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cConsumers are feeling a greater hit to their pocketbooks, with consistently high levels of online inflation in categories such as groceries and pet products,\u201d said Patrick Brown, vice president of growth marketing and insights, Adobe. \u201cBut while e-commerce prices have risen more than years past, durable demand shows that consumers are embracing more personalized experiences in the digital economy as well as the conveniences of online shopping, particularly for growing categories like groceries.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOver the last 12 months, apparel has consistently outpaced the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which captures prices that consumers pay for goods offline. In February, apparel prices rose 11.0% in the DPI, compared to 3.1% in the CPI (indexed to 2014). Non-prescription drugs followed a similar trend, with the DPI up 7.9% and the CPI down 1.2% in February. For everyday staples like groceries and pet products, online prices now move in tandem with the CPI.\r\n\n\r\nIn March, 14 of the 18 categories tracked by the DPI saw YoY price increases, with apparel rising the most. Price drops were observed in four categories: electronics, jewelry, toys and computers.\r\n\n\r\nOn a MoM basis, 12 of the 18 categories saw March price increases, with price drops observed in categories including electronics, books, toys, flowers\/related gifts, computers and sporting goods.\r\n\n\nNotable Categories in the Adobe Digital Price Index for March:\n\n\n\nApparel: Prices were up 16.3% YoY (up 0.3% MoM), with the category now seeing a full year of online inflation. In this time period, apparel prices online also outpaced the CPI. This reverses the longstanding pattern for the category, where seasonal discounts created predictable peaks and valleys in online prices.\r\n\n\n\n\nGroceries: Prices were up 9.0% YoY (up 1.4% MoM), the highest increase for the category on an annual basis. Grocery prices online have been surging, up from a 7.6% YoY increase in February and 5.8% YoY increase in January. In May 2021, prices were up by just 0.4% YoY. March now marks the 26th consecutive month where online prices have risen for groceries, and it is the only category to move in lockstep with the CPI on a long-term basis.\r\n\n\n\n\nPet Products: Online inflation is accelerating for the category as prices rose 7.0% YoY (up 1.5% MoM). It follows a 5.6% YoY increase in February and 4.7% YoY increase in January. Prices for pet products have risen for nearly two years (23 consecutive months), following the rise in demand as more consumers brought pets into their homes. During the last holiday season (2021), online sales for pet products were up by 63% versus pre-season levels.\r\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Care Products: Prices were up 1.4% YoY (up 0.1% MoM), marking the fourth consecutive month of online inflation after prices decreased 0.9% YoY in November 2021. Prior to the pandemic (before March 2020), online price increases were unusual for the category, with only two months seeing YoY online inflation over 1% (November 2017 up 2.4% YoY and December 2017 up 1.2% YoY).\r\n\n\n\n\nTools and Home Improvement: Prices were up 8.5% YoY (up 1.1% MoM), the highest increase for the category on an annual basis. In February, prices were up 7.8% YoY. March also marks the 16th consecutive month of YoY inflation for the category, as consumers continue to invest in the upkeep and maintenance of their homes.\r\n\n\n\nMethodology\n\n\r\nThe DPI is modeled after the Consumer Price Index (CPI), published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and uses the Fisher Price Index to track online prices. The Fisher Price Index uses quantities of matched products purchased in the current period (month) and a previous period (previous month) to calculate the price changes by category. Adobe\u2019s analysis is weighted by the real quantities of the products purchased in the two adjacent months.\r\n\n\r\nAdobe uses a combination of Adobe Sensei, Adobe\u2019s AI and machine learning framework, and manual effort to segment the products into the categories defined by the CPI manual. The methodology was first developed alongside renowned economists Austan Goolsbee and Pete Klenow.\r\n\n\nAbout Adobe\n\n\r\nAdobe is changing the world through digital experiences.

Information\n\n\r\nAdobe continues to provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but believes evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Adobe's operating results. Adobe believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management.\r\n\n\r\nAdobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information as well as non-GAAP measures, which may exclude items such as stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles, investment gains and losses, the related tax impact of all of these items, income tax adjustments, and the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Adobe uses these non-GAAP measures in order to assess the performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods. Whenever such a non-GAAP measure is used, Adobe provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above.\r\n\n\n\n\n \nInvestor Relations Contact \r\n\nJonathan Vaas\r\nAdobe\r\nir@adobe.com \r\nPublic Relations Contact \r\nAshley Levine\r\nAdobe\r\naslevine@adobe.com Source: Adobe\n","31":"\nSAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- \nAdobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) today announced that it recently became aware of an unsolicited \"mini-tender\" offer by Tutanota LLC (\u201cTutanota\u201d) to purchase up to one hundred thousand shares of Adobe's common stock, representing significantly less than one percent of Adobe's common stock outstanding. The offer price of $500 per share is conditioned on, among other things, the closing price per share of Adobe's common stock exceeding $500 per share on the last trading day before the offer expires. This means that unless Tutanota waives this condition, Adobe stockholders who tender their shares in the offer will receive a below-market price. Adobe cautions stockholders that Tutanota can extend the offer for successive periods of 45 to 180 days, in which case payment would be delayed beyond the scheduled expiration date of Friday, April 8, 2022. There is no guarantee the conditions of the offer will be satisfied.\n\n\nAdobe recommends that stockholders do not tender their shares in response to Tutanota's offer because the offer is at a price below a conditional market price for Adobe's common stock and subject to numerous additional conditions. Stockholders who have already tendered their shares may withdraw them at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on Friday, April 8, 2022, in accordance with the offering documents.\n\n\nAdobe does not endorse Tutanota's unsolicited mini-tender offer and is not associated in any way with Tutanota, its mini-tender offer, or its mini-tender offer documents.\n\n\nTutanota's mini-tender offer seeks less than five percent of Adobe's outstanding common stock. Mini-tender offers seek to acquire less than five percent of a company's outstanding shares, thereby avoiding many disclosure and procedural requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201c) that apply to offers for more than five percent of a company's outstanding shares. As a result, mini-tender offers do not provide investors with the same level of protections as provided by larger tender offers under U.S. securities laws. Tutanota has made similar unsolicited mini-tender offers for stock of other public companies.\n\n\nThe SEC has cautioned investors about these offers, noting that \u201csome bidders make mini-tender offers at below-market prices, hoping that they will catch investors off guard if the investors do not compare the offer price to the current market price.\u201d The SEC's guidance to investors on mini-tenders is available at https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/reportspubs\/investor-publications\/investorpubsminitendhtm.html.\n\n\nAdobe encourages brokers and dealers, as well as other market participants, to review the SEC's letter regarding broker-dealer mini-tender offer dissemination and disclosure at https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/divisions\/marketreg\/minitenders\/sia072401.htm.\n\n\nStockholders should obtain current market quotations for their shares, consult with their broker or financial advisor, and exercise caution with respect to Tutanota's mini-tender offer. Adobe requests that a copy of this news release be included with all distributions of materials related to Tutanota's mini-tender offer related to Adobe's common stock.\n\n\nAbout Adobe\n\n\nAdobe is changing the world through digital experiences.

Adobe Real-Time CDP is now the choice of industry-leading brands across all major sectors, including retail, healthcare, financial services, technology and media and entertainment. With the innovations unveiled at Adobe Summit 2022, Adobe Real-Time CDP is even more powerful, with an array of capabilities that empower businesses to maximize the value of their customer data. Some of the latest brands that have chosen Adobe include Major League Baseball\u2122, The Coca-Cola Company, Coles, General Motors, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, EY, Panera Bread, T.Rowe Price, ServiceNow, TSB Bank, Real Madrid and Suncorp.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo meet changing consumer expectations in the digital economy, brands need to evolve their data strategy and personalization efforts,\u201d said Amit Ahuja, senior vice president, Adobe Experience Cloud platform and products at Adobe. \u201cThe fact that so many of the world\u2019s leading brands are choosing Adobe Real-Time CDP shows that real-time customer data and tight integrations across Adobe Experience Cloud are essential to building powerful and personal digital experiences.\u201d\r\n\n\nAdobe Real-Time CDP empowers brands to view and manage customer profiles, update in real-time and activate the customer insights through Adobe Experience Cloud applications across the entire customer journey.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAdobe Real-Time CDP is a market-leading customer data platform that allows brands to build actionable unified profiles to create tailored customer journeys that build customer loyalty and trust,\u201d said Mila D\u2019Antonio, principal analyst of Omdia\u2019s Business Platforms and Applications. \u201cThe widespread adoption of Real-Time CDP across a range of industries translates to brands being able to deliver proactive and relevant experiences to millions of customers in real-time.\u201d\r\n\n\nNew Real-Time CDP Capabilities Power Next-generation Customer Experiences\n\n\r\nWith Real-Time CDP, Adobe continues to transform how brands engage with their audiences by unlocking new capabilities, including data collection, enrichment and distribution at a market-leading scale.

These new capabilities \u2013 which enable businesses to deliver seamless customer journeys \u2013 build upon hundreds of AI and machine learning (ML) innovations that are already embedded throughout Adobe\u2019s products. Over 80% of Adobe Experience Cloud customers already use AI features to power their digital experiences. The AI capabilities announced today include product recommendations, live search results, intelligent budget forecasting and allocation, cross-channel budget optimization and intelligent content creation and delivery.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWith Adobe Sensei, Adobe\u2019s AI engine, it\u2019s now possible to achieve things that were previously beyond imagination, like having millions of one-on-one interactions with customers at the same time, and in real-time,\u201d said Adobe Fellow Anil Kamath. \u201cAdobe has been in the AI game for more than 15 years, and we\u2019re able to leverage trillions of data and content assets to provide businesses with the insights that drive customer behavior.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNew AI and ML capabilities embedded throughout Adobe Experience Cloud provide brands with additional opportunities to drive greater efficiency, revenue and business growth, including:\r\n\n\n\nSales opportunity predictions (Adobe Real-Time CDP): With multiple people in a buying team and multiple touchpoints across digital and physical interactions, determining which buying teams are likely to purchase can be challenging. It requires combining and analyzing data from various technologies and complex calculations. By applying Predictive Lead and Account Scoring to insights within Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform (CDP), B2B marketing teams can focus their resources on the right prospects. They can easily determine when it is the right time for sales teams to engage with prospective buyers based on how their behavior resembles that of actual buyers. This capability will also be available with Adobe Marketo Engage later this year.\r\n\n\n\n\nCross-channel budget optimization (Customer Journey Analytics): Getting a complete picture of how campaigns perform across the entire customer journey can be a challenge. Now attribution models from Attribution AI can be incorporated into Customer Journey Analytics, giving brands a unified view of how online and offline campaigns are performing. Customers also benefit from return on investment (ROI) insights and the ability to configure attribution models that best fit their business.\r\n\n\n\n\nAI-driven product recommendations and live search results (Adobe Commerce): With AI-driven product recommendations in Adobe Commerce, business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) brands can leverage AI to suggest relevant products based on shopper behavior, product sales, product features, visual elements and popular trends. This provides a tailored experience for the shopper and improves merchants\u2019 conversion, retention, cross-sell and up-sell motions. Live Search from Adobe Commerce combines real-time catalog data with the AI capabilities of Adobe Sensei to enable ultra-fast, highly relevant and personalized search results. Adobe Sensei helps merchants identify search facets automatically for each shopper query, so they don\u2019t have to spend time writing long and cumbersome site search rules.\r\n\n\n\n\nIntelligent budget forecasting and allocation (Attribution AI): Accurately forecasting and allocating marketing budgets can be challenging for today\u2019s brands. Historical data often serves as a key data point but may not reflect the fast-paced shifts in consumer preferences, especially on digital channels. Adobe is simplifying the process with a new AI-driven capability \u2013 Marketing Mix Modeling. This advanced predictive modeling capability combines historical data with real-time insights from Adobe\u2019s Attribution AI service to help brands easily and accurately analyze marketing spend and campaign performance for the most effective offline and online channels.\r\n\n\n\r\nDuring \u201cSneaks\u201d at Adobe Summit, Adobe will also provide attendees with a sneak peek of several AI innovations from Adobe\u2019s research labs focused on helping brands build great customer experiences. The \u2018Go Beyond Conversion\u2019 sneak, for example, uses AI to create customer experience scores on brand websites. Brands can learn how site visitors interact with content and direct customers to improved experiences to increase conversion.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPersonalized customer experiences are a key differentiator for brands in today\u2019s digital economy,\u201d said Ritu Jyoti, IDC group vice president, Worldwide Artificial Intelligence and Automation Research. \u201cFor brands to deliver the experiences consumers value they need AI technology, like Adobe Sensei, to analyze customer data, predict behavior and ultimately power the delivery of contextually relevant experiences quickly, even from the first interaction.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAll of Adobe\u2019s AI initiatives are guided by principles of accountability, responsibility and transparency. Adobe holds itself to the highest standards for developing AI ethically, responsibly and inclusive of Adobe\u2019s customers and communities.\r\n\n\nAbout Adobe\n\n\r\nAdobe is changing the world through digital experiences.

Providers can then combine this preference data with other health data to provide consumers with a seamless and connected experience, leading to improved care and customer loyalty.\r\n\n\n\n\nInsurance companies: The complexity of the healthcare ecosystem can be overwhelming for healthcare consumers. With the data insights available within Adobe Experience Cloud for Healthcare, insurance companies can help their members navigate the healthcare system while reducing costs. For example, by utilizing a single view of member activities across channels (including claims, website visits online chat or phone support), payors (insurance companies) can take a holistic view of their members and their care. Payors will be able to provide personalized recommendations for everything from in-network specialists to scheduling wellness exams.\r\n\n\n\n\nPharmacies: Adobe\u2019s breadth of omnichannel capabilities enables pharmacies to personalize and unify in-store and digital experiences for visitors.

Pharmacies can also automate data-driven offers that can build customer loyalty and drive business growth.\r\n\n\n\n\nLife sciences companies: Life sciences companies can use Adobe Experience Cloud for Healthcare to engage providers and participants with timely information on the right channels.

Healthcare enterprises are already using HIPAA-ready applications, including Adobe Marketo Engage, Adobe Experience Manager as a Managed Service, Adobe Connect as a Managed Service, Adobe Acrobat Sign and Adobe Workfront to create and deliver personalized digital experiences. Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform (CDP) is expected to be HIPAA-ready in May 2022, giving healthcare enterprises the ability to bring together a complete view of healthcare consumers. Adobe Customer Journey Analytics and Adobe Journey Optimizer are expected to be HIPAA-ready later this year, empowering healthcare enterprises to turn actionable insights into connected, personalized healthcare experiences.\r\n\n\nAbout Adobe\n\n\r\nAdobe is changing the world through digital experiences.

Demand remained strong in 2021 with $885 billion in online spend, up 8.9% year-over-year (YoY). As the digital economy shifts to more personalized customer experiences, Adobe expects the annual online spend in the U.S. to surpass $1 trillion for the first time in 2022. And as the digital economy expands, new Adobe data reveals trends and new consumer shopping behaviors:\r\n\n\nInflation Contributes to E-Commerce Growth\n\n\r\nOf the $1.7 trillion spent by consumers, $32 billion was driven by higher prices. In other words, consumers paid $32 billion more for the same amount of goods. Online inflation, first observed in June 2020, has persisted for 21 consecutive months. The impact was most notable in 2021, where $22 billion of e-commerce growth was driven by higher prices compared to just $4.7 billion in 2020.\r\n\n\r\nIn the first two months of 2022, $3.8 billion in e-commerce growth was driven by higher prices. Inflation has not deterred demand, however, with the same two months driving $138 billion in online spend, up 13.8% YoY. In 2022, Adobe expects consumers could pay as much as $27 billion more online for the same amount of goods due to inflation.\r\n\n\nGroceries Become a Major E-Commerce Category\n\n\r\nIn 2021, 41.8% of e-commerce overall was driven by just three categories: groceries, electronics and apparel. The pandemic has impacted the trajectory of each one:\r\n\n\n\nGroceries: 2020 was a breakout year for the category, with $73.7 billion spent online, surging 103% YoY ($79.2 billion in 2021, up 7.2% YoY). Groceries is now 8.9% of the e-commerce share overall, up from 6.3% in 2019 and down slightly from 2020 (9.1%) when demand surged early in the pandemic. Consumers now spend an average of $6.7 billion each month for groceries, up from $3.1 billion pre-pandemic. Adobe expects the category to top $85 billion in 2022.\r\n\n\n\n\nElectronics: As the largest e-commerce category, electronics drove $165 billion in online spend in 2021, up 8% YoY. This represents an 18.6% share of e-commerce overall, down slightly from 2020 (18.8%) and 2019 (21%) as other categories grew. The pandemic cemented electronics as the top category, with consumers spending $152.7 billion in 2020, up a significant 26.8% YoY. U.S. consumers now spend an average of $13.6 billion each month for electronics, up from $9.9 billion pre-pandemic. Adobe expects the category to top $174 billion in 2022.\r\n\n\n\n\nApparel: As consumers spent more time at home, apparel demand slumped. In 2020, apparel grew by 9.1% YoY ($115.8 billion) as e-commerce overall grew by 41% YoY. Growth was modest in 2021 at $126.2 billion, up 8% YoY. This represents a 14.3% of e-commerce share overall, down from 2019 (18.5%) and in line with 2020 (14.2%). Pre-pandemic, apparel spend in 2019 was $14.4 billion behind electronics. By 2021, the gap widened to $38.8 billion. Apparel is still a major category, with consumers spending an average of $10.2 billion each month, up from $8.7 billion pre-pandemic. Adobe expects the category to top $130 billion in 2022.\r\n\n\n\r\n\u201cE-commerce is being reshaped by grocery shopping, a category with minimal discounting compared to legacy categories like electronics and apparel,\u201d said Patrick Brown, vice president of growth marketing and insights, Adobe. \u201cIt highlights a shift in the digital economy, where speed and convenience are becoming just as important as cost savings.\u201d\r\n\n\nAdditional Insights\n\n\n\nOut-of-Stock: Consumers have seen 60 billion out-of-stock (OOS) messages in the last 24 months (March 2020 to February 2022), in the face of supply chain constraints. The odds of seeing an OOS message are now one in 59 pages, up from one in 200 pages pre-pandemic (a 235% increase). In the last four months (November 2021 through February 2022), consumers have seen over 12 billion OOS messages, a trend expected to persist in 2022.\r\n\n\n\n\nBuy Now Pay Later (BNPL): As consumers spent more online during the pandemic and looked for new ways to manage their money, BNPL orders between October and November 2020 increased 528% YoY while revenue grew 412% YoY. In recent months, growth has slowed, but demand remained strong: BNPL orders are up 53% YoY while revenue is up 56% YoY.\r\n\n\n\n\nCurbside Pickup: The fulfillment method already saw strong adoption before the pandemic, but health and safety concerns gave it a boost. The demand has been durable, with many consumers now valuing the speed and convenience. In 2022 so far, curbside pickup accounted for 20% of all online orders (for retailers who offer the service), establishing itself as a major fulfilment method.\r\n\n\n\nMethodology\r\nThe Adobe Digital Economy Index offers the most comprehensive set of insights of its kind, based on analysis through Adobe Analytics that covers over one trillion visits to U.S. retail sites and over 100 million SKUs in 18 product categories\u2014more than any other technology company or research organization. Online inflation insights, from the Adobe Digital Price Index, is modeled after the Consumer Price Index (CPI), published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and uses the Fisher Price Index to track online prices. The Fisher Price Index uses quantities of matched products purchased in the current period (month) and a previous period (previous month) to calculate the price changes by category.\r\n\n\r\nAdobe\u2019s analysis is weighted by the real quantities of the products purchased in the two adjacent months. Adobe uses a combination of Adobe Sensei, Adobe\u2019s AI and machine learning framework, and manual effort to segment the products into the categories defined by the CPI manual. The methodology was first developed alongside renowned economists Austan Goolsbee and Pete Klenow.\r\n\n\nAbout Adobe\r\nAdobe is changing the world through digital experiences.

The previous high point was over the 2021 holiday season, where online prices were up 7.1% YoY in December 2021. February also marks the 15th consecutive month of YoY inflation for the category.\r\n\n\n\n\nApparel: Prices were up 16.7% YoY (up 0.3% MoM), on par with the 2021 holiday season where prices increased 17.3% YoY in November 2021 and 16.6% in December 2021. The category has seen nearly a full year of online inflation (11 consecutive months). It is a departure from a predictable pattern pre-pandemic, where seasonal discounting drove peaks and valleys in apparel prices online.\r\n\n\n\n\nGroceries: Prices were up 7.6% YoY (up 1.9% MoM), the highest increase for the category on an annual basis. February marks the 25th consecutive month where online prices have risen for groceries, making it the only category that has moved in lockstep with the Consumer Price Index.\r\n\n\n\n\nOffice Supplies: After eight consecutive months where online prices fell or were flat on an annual basis, office supplies were up again for a second month with prices up 1.8% YoY (up 0.3% MoM) in February. In the month prior, prices increased by 1.5% YoY (up 2.2% MoM). The unpredictability of COVID-19 variants has kept many consumers working from home still, driving up demand and prices for products in home offices.\r\n\n\n\n\nPet Products: Prices were up 5.6% YoY (up 1.3% MoM) and have been steadily rising for the last 10 months. In May 2021, prices were only up 0.9% YoY (up 0.1% MoM).

In January 2022, online prices increased 2.7%year-over-year (YoY) and 1.1% month-over-month (MoM). This marks the 20th consecutive month of YoY online inflation. December 2021 price increases (up 3.1% YoY) contributed to a record high holiday season, during which online prices in November 2021 increased 3.5% YoY.

January marks the 24th consecutive month where online prices have risen for groceries, making it the only category that has moved in lockstep with the Consumer Price Index, which captures prices consumers pay in physical stores.\r\n\n\n\n\nMedical Equipment and Supplies: Prices were up 8.2% YoY (down 0.1% MoM), the highest increase for the category on an annual basis. It coincided with a January surge in the COVID-19 Omicron variant, which drove greater demand for testing kits at a time when overall supply was constrained.\r\n\n\n\n\nOffice Supplies: After eight consecutive months where online prices fell or were flat on an annual basis, office supplies increased 1.5% YoY (up 2.2% MoM) in January. COVID-19 variants have kept many consumers working from home, driving up demand and prices for products in home offices.\r\n\n\n\n\nElectronics: Prices were down 3.4% YoY, a greater price drop compared to December when online prices were down 2.6% YoY. As one of the major categories in e-commerce, electronics\u2019 price fluctuations have had a greater impact on topline inflation. On monthly basis, prices are up 2.0% after holiday discounts seen in the prior month.\r\n\n\n\n\nApparel: Prices were up 15.8% YoY (down 1.7% MoM), down from the holiday season where prices increased 17.3% YoY in November 2021 and 16.6% in December 2021.

December\u2019s price increases marked the 19th consecutive month of YoY online inflation and followed the record high of November 2021, when online prices increased 3.5% YoY. In December, groceries and apparel were standout categories, with grocery prices seeing their highest annual increase in more than a year (4.9% YoY, 0.7% MoM). Apparel increased 16.6% YoY (0.6% MoM).\r\n\n\n\n(Graphic: Business Wire)\n\n\r\nThe DPI provides the most comprehensive view into how much consumers pay for goods online. Powered by Adobe Analytics, it analyzes one trillion visits to retail sites and over 100 million SKUs across 18 product categories: electronics, apparel, appliances, books, toys, computers, groceries, furniture\/bedding, tools\/home improvement, home\/garden, pet products, jewelry, medical equipment\/supplies, sporting goods, personal care products, flowers\/related gifts, nonprescription drugs and office supplies.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cInflation online is showing no signs of easing, as durable consumer demand is being met with the same, persistent supply challenges that produced over six billion out-of-stock messages online this holiday season,\u201d said Patrick Brown, vice president of growth marketing and insights, Adobe. \u201cAs consumers contend with higher offline prices for everything from gas to rent, they are finding that e-commerce is still a less expensive option when it comes to goods like toys, electronics and even jewelry.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn December 2021, 12 of the 18 categories tracked by the DPI saw YoY price increases, with apparel rising faster than any other category. Price drops were observed in six categories: electronics, office supplies, jewelry, books, toys and computers.\r\n\n\r\nOn a MoM basis, 13 of the 18 categories saw December price increases, with price drops observed in five categories, including toys, pet products, home\/garden, computers and flowers\/related gifts.\r\n\n\nNotable Categories in the Adobe Digital Price Index (December 2021)\n\n\n\nGroceries: Prices were up 4.9% YoY (up 0.7% MoM), the highest increase on an annual basis since October 2020, when prices jumped 5.2% YoY. It is the only category that has moved in lockstep with the Consumer Price Index, which captures prices consumers are paying in physical stores.\r\n\n\nApparel: Prices were up 16.6% YoY (up 0.6% MoM). This is the ninth consecutive month where online prices have risen on an annual basis in a category that typically sees consistent periods of deflation when seasonal discounts kick in.\r\n\n\nAppliances: Prices were up 4.1% YoY (up 3.0% MoM). This marks the 20th consecutive month of inflation for the category, at a time when consumers are keen to invest in their homes. Over the holiday season (November 1 to December 31), online sales for appliances doubled compared to pre-season (September 2021) levels. Furniture and bedding followed a similar trend, after 20 consecutive months of inflation, where December 2021 prices were up 3.3% YoY and up 0.8% MoM.\r\n\n\nTools & Home Improvement: Prices were up 7.1% YoY (a record high for the category) and up 1.0% MoM, marking the 13th consecutive month of online inflation as consumers continue to spend more in this category. Over the holiday season (November 1 to December 31), online sales in the category grew by 1.7 times pre-season (September 2021) levels.\r\n\n\nElectronics: Prices were down 2.6% YoY (up 0.4% MoM). This is a greater price drop compared to November 2021, when prices for products in the category were only down 0.4% YoY and nearly moved into inflationary territory for the first time since Adobe began tracking price trends in 2014.\r\n\n\n\nAdobe Holiday Season Recap Report: For additional insights on the 2021 holiday shopping season (November 1 to December 31) including consumer spend online, out-of-stock levels and more, find Adobe\u2019s recap report here.\r\n\n\nMethodology\n\n\r\nThe DPI is modeled after the Consumer Price Index, published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and uses the Fisher Price Index to track online prices. The Fisher Price Index uses quantities of matched products purchased in the current period (month) and a previous period (previous month) to calculate the price changes by category. Adobe\u2019s analysis is weighted by the real quantities of the products purchased in the two adjacent months.\r\n\n\r\nAdobe uses a combination of Adobe Sensei, Adobe\u2019s AI and machine learning framework, and manual effort to segment the products into the categories defined by the CPI manual. The methodology was first developed alongside renowned economists Austan Goolsbee and Pete Klenow.\r\n\n\nAbout Adobe\n\n\r\nAdobe is changing the world through digital experiences.
