Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information


Adobe continues to provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but believes evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Adobe's operating results. Adobe believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management.


Adobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information as well as non-GAAP measures, which may exclude items such as stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles, investment gains and losses, the related tax impact of all of these items, income tax adjustments, and the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Adobe uses these non-GAAP measures in order to assess the performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods. Whenever such a non-GAAP measure is used, Adobe provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above.

4,"Thursday, December 09, 2021 08:00 AM",Adobe Digital Price Index: Online Inflation Hits Record High,"


Online prices increased 3.5% year-over-year


November marked 18th consecutive month of online inflation


One dollar out of every four dollars now spent online in the U.S.

 SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) today announced the latest online inflation data for the month of November 2021. Online prices hit a record high at a 3.5% year-over-year (YoY) increase while prices are down 2% month-over-month (MoM) due to holiday discounts. This is the highest YoY increase since Adobe first began tracking the digital economy in 2014, and it marks the 18th consecutive month of YoY online inflation. Apparel was a standout category with prices up 17.3% YoY and down just 0.4% MoM, reaching a record high of inflation. One dollar out of every four dollars* is now spent online in the U.S., making the digital economy a significant component of the overall economy.



(Graphic: Business Wire)


The Adobe Digital Price Index (DPI) provides the most comprehensive view into how much consumers are paying for goods online. The DPI covers more than 100 million products in the U.S. and is modeled after the Consumer Price Index issued by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The DPI is updated monthly and covers 18 product categories: electronics, apparel, appliances, books, toys, computers, groceries, furniture/bedding, tools/home improvement, home/garden, pet products, jewelry, medical equipment/supplies, sporting goods, personal care products, flowers/related gifts, nonprescription drugs and office supplies.


“Census Bureau data shows that the e-commerce share of non-fuel retail spending has tripled over the last decade as more expenditures like groceries and home improvement move online,” said economist Marshall Reinsdorf, former senior economist at International Monetary Fund. ""Measures of digital economy prices have a growing role to play in how we understand inflation, and the Adobe Digital Price Index provides a timely pulse on this important part of the cost-of-living picture that complements indicators like the Consumer Price Index.”


“Ongoing supply chain constraints and durable consumer demand have underpinned the record high inflation in e-commerce, with apparel seeing high volumes of out-of-stock messages online compared to other categories,” said Patrick Brown, vice president of growth marketing and insights, Adobe. “With offline prices surging in the Consumer Price Index, however, it is still cheaper to shop online for categories such as toys, computers and sporting goods.”


Notable Categories in the Adobe Digital Price Index (November 2021)


In November 2021, 11 of the 18 categories tracked by the Adobe Digital Price Index saw YoY price increases. Apparel prices rose faster than any other category, while price drops were observed in seven categories: electronics, personal care products, office supplies, jewelry, books, toys and computers. On a MoM basis, all but four categories (groceries, pet products, tools/home improvement and medical equipment/supplies) saw prices decrease as holiday discounts kicked in.



Apparel: Prices are up 17.3% YoY and down 0.4% MoM. Since 2014, only three months (August 2016, January 2020, February 2020) saw apparel prices rise online by 9% or more YoY. For the past eight consecutive months, online prices for the category have risen by over 9% YoY every month.




Groceries: Prices are up 3.9% YoY and up 0.6% MoM. Online prices have risen on an annual basis for 22 months, moving in lock step with the Consumer Price Index, which captures prices that consumers are paying for groceries in physical stores.




Electronics: Prices are down 0.4% YoY and down 4.0% MoM. Historically (2015–2019), prices were down 9.06% YoY on average for the category, which includes gaming consoles, mobile devices, televisions and wearables. On Cyber Monday 2021, consumers paid more for electronics compared to years past, with price drops in the 12% range versus 27% range.




Appliances: Prices are up 4% YoY and down 2.7% MoM. The category has seen 19 consecutive months of online inflation on an annual basis. After hitting a low point in December 2019 (prices down 4.6% YoY), prices began rising by May 2020 (up 0.2% YoY) and hit its peak in December 2020 (up 7.1% YoY).




Toys: Prices are down 2.9% YoY and down 3.6% MoM. It is one of few categories where pricing trends follow a historical pattern of persistent, stronger deflation. (Books and computers follow a similar trend). On Cyber Monday 2021, toys was the only category where price drops were greater than last season, in the 22% range versus 19% range.



Methodology


The DPI is modeled after the Consumer Price Index, published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and uses the Fisher Price Index to track online prices. The Fisher Ideal Price Index uses quantities of matched products purchased in the current period (month) and a previous period (previous month) to calculate the price changes by category. Adobe’s analysis is weighted by the real quantities of the products purchased in the two adjacent months.


Powered by Adobe Analytics, the DPI analyzes 1 trillion visits to retail sites and over 100 million SKUs in 18 product categories. Adobe uses a combination of Adobe Sensei, Adobe’s AI and machine learning framework, and manual effort to segment the products into the categories defined by the CPI manual. The methodology was first developed alongside renowned economists Austan Goolsbee and Pete Klenow.


* Adobe expects $1 in $4 will be spent online during the 2021 holiday shopping season (Nov. 1 to Dec. 31), indexed to the National Retail Federation’s (NRF) total retail forecast that includes in-store sales.

Major League Baseball adopts Adobe Experience Cloud, Adobe Creative Cloud and Adobe Sign to deliver more personalized experiences for fans
 SAN JOSE, Calif. & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) and Major League Baseball (MLB), North America’s most historic professional sports league, today announced a major expansion of their partnership to reimagine fan engagement and continue to bring America’s favorite pastime to the next generation of fans – powered across Adobe Experience Cloud, Adobe Creative Cloud, and Adobe Sign.


The partnership will empower MLB to bring new personalized, seamless experiences to its millions of fans. Fans will feel a part of the ballpark atmosphere from wherever they enjoy baseball – be it at home, on the go, or at the park itself. The league and its Clubs will be able to collaborate more seamlessly with advanced tools for signing contracts, sharing creative assets and engaging directly with their fans.


New, fan-friendly features can include personalized promotions and notifications tailored to individual fans – at the ballpark potentially highlighting which entrances will offer the fastest journey to their seats, VIP parking promotions or discounts on grab-and-go concessions. Fans who live outside their favorite team’s locale will also be able to receive alerts when their favorite club or player is in town or get free trials for MLB.TV so they can watch games from the comfort of their couch or on the go.


MLB will be able to drive greater efficiency and fully digitize workflows that require an individual’s consent, approval or signature, such as player agreements and vendor contracts. As an added benefit, this is projected to save thousands of reams of paper every year – all powered by Adobe Document Cloud, including Adobe Sign. MLB and MLB Network, which already rely on Adobe Creative Cloud to create and deliver rich content on television and online, will be able to streamline content creation in the future and more seamlessly manage creative workflows with Adobe Workfront as their new marketing system of record. 

“MLB has long been a global leader in digital experiences among sports leagues, with a fan-first orientation across the web, mobile apps, and social media,” said Anil Chakravarthy, executive vice president and general manager, Digital Experience Business and Worldwide Field Operations, Adobe. “The expansion of the partnership will allow MLB to bring some truly personalized experiences to fans, made possible by millions of fan profiles built in real-time.”


“We’ve gone out of our way to create digital tools to improve the fan experience,” said Chris Marinak, Chief Operations and Strategy Officer, Major League Baseball. “We’re bringing personalized experiences and information to fans so that they feel like we know who they are, who their favorite team is and who their favorite players are.

SAN JOSE, Calif. — The Adobe Analytics Student Challenge is the only global competition where college students can win prize money, while also walking away with in-demand skills for the workplace today. It has launched careers in fields from data science and product management, to consulting and marketing. Teams from universities and colleges around the world are given several weeks to analyze real data provided by a brand partner and tasked to help the organization solve a pressing business challenge. Using Adobe Analytics, the same customer analytics tool used by Fortune 500 companies, students learn to produce actionable insights that can drive their recommendations.This year, Adobe has partnered with The Walt Disney Company for the Adobe Analytics Challenge 2021, and students will be asked to dig into their e-commerce strategy. As an organization, Disney is a leading international family entertainment and media enterprise with an expansive portfolio that covers everything from theme parks and film studios, to direct-to-consumer streaming services, consumer products and much more. Over the years, its digital audience has grown substantially, as customers go online to research, get inspired and transact. The central theme of the Challenge this year will be around nurturing loyalty online, with insights that can better profile customer intent.Teams will have to present ideas that ultimately help Disney deliver a magical experience online. Students will deliver recommendations on how to drive repeat and multiple purchases online, for instance, and also be asked to conduct a deep analysis of the online shopping cart. Cart abandonment will be considered this year as well, with students exploring ways to recover e-commerce baskets that shoppers walk away from. Lastly, teams will be asked to analyze the customer journey across mobile and desktop channels, uncovering new ways for Disney to approach these properties.“As a global brand that leverages technology of all kinds in support of storytelling, Disney is excited to assist with efforts to help advance educational opportunities for college students around the world interested in this career path,” said Michael DeCook, vice president, Digital & Travel Operations Analytics. “The Adobe Analytics Challenge will provide real-world experience in digital data analytics and help pave the way for a great future in this dynamic field.”Adobe unveiled the finalist teams today. After a record-setting year with over 8,300 student applicants, representing over 700 institutions across 22 countries, six teams have made the final round. They come from schools including Willamette University, Yale School of Management, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, University of California (Davis), Brigham Young University and Université d’Angers. The winning team will follow last year’s top team, the Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines) Dhanbad, who worked with Nike as the brand partner.The finalists are the latest cohort to join an alumni network that has leveraged the experience to join organizations like The Home Depot and the Boston Consulting Group. After 16 years of the competition, the successful track record also drove interest from higher education instructors, who wanted to replicate the Challenge experience in their classrooms. In response, Adobe unveiled the Adobe Analytics curriculum for higher education earlier this year. The global program provides free access to Adobe Analytics year round, along with course curriculum and hands-on activities. Students can work with real data in the classroom and conduct analysis that drives business decisions. Hundreds of institutions have registered since launch.“Students are entering a job market today that has fundamentally changed in the last 18 months, as the pandemic brought even more of our daily lives online,” said Anil Chakravarthy, executive vice president and GM, Adobe Experience Cloud. “You will not find a single organization now where technology is not the centerpiece of its overall strategy, and it makes digital literacy crucial for the next generation to compete successfully in the digital economy.”To watch the finals (presented virtually this year), tune in on November 9 at AdobeAnalyticsChallenge.com. The competition starts at 9:00 a.m. PT / 12:00 p.m. ET and will be available on demand afterwards.

Adobe Introduces Innovation Across Creative Cloud Powered by Adobe Sensei, Accelerates Video Creation and Collaboration Across Stakeholders with Addition of Frame.io, Advances 3D and Immersive Categories and Previews Photoshop and Illustrator on the Web
 SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
Today, Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) kicked off Adobe MAX 2021, the largest creativity conference in the world. The company delivered innovation across Creative Cloud flagship applications and introduced new collaboration capabilities to fuel new levels of creativity for millions of customers worldwide, from students to social media creators to creative professionals.


At Adobe MAX, the company announced major updates across Creative Cloud flagship applications powered by Adobe Sensei, accelerated the video creation process with the addition of Frame.io and advanced 3D and immersive authoring abilities. Adobe also previewed new collaboration capabilities with the introduction of Creative Cloud Canvas, Creative Cloud Spaces and betas of Photoshop and Illustrator on the web.


In support of the company’s Content Authenticity Initiative, Adobe shipped Content Credentials in Photoshop, an opt-in feature that shows a creator’s identity and edit history to ensure they are getting attribution for their work; Content Credentials will also connect to NFT marketplaces. The company also introduced a subscription model on Behance to enable creators to monetize their work.


“Creativity is evolving to meet the new realities of work. Adobe is bringing new collaboration capabilities, more AI-powered features and web-first applications to Creative Cloud to unleash our customers’ full creative potential,” said Scott Belsky, chief product officer and executive vice president, Creative Cloud, Adobe. “We are reimagining Creative Cloud products and services to connect creative teams, enable new ways to create and empower more creative careers.”


Unleashing Creative Innovation


Through the latest updates to Creative Cloud flagship apps—powered by Adobe Sensei AI technology—Adobe defines the future of creativity through continuous innovation. Major releases at MAX include:




Photoshop
: Three AI-powered Neural Filters in Photoshop desktop and Camera Raw file support on the iPad.



Lightroom/Lightroom Classic
: More powerful and precise ML-powered masking capabilities, recommended presets and Community Remixing.



Premiere Pro

Illustrator
: Improved 3D effects and access to Substance 3D materials on desktop and a Sensei-powered Vectorize Technology Preview on iPad.



Character Animator

Substance 3D
: Tighter integration of 3D content, effects and capabilities across Illustrator and Stock. A new Modeler (Private Beta) app joins the Substance 3D Collection, showcasing the role that 3D and immersive technology will play in helping users create the future.



Fresco
: Turn any drawing layer into an animation layer to create motion, draw with new perspective guides and grids, and use non-destructive adjustment layers to explore and enhance colors.



Enabling Connected Creativity


At MAX, the company previewed the future of creativity on the web, which is designed to help creative teams collaborate in real time, across multiple surfaces and stakeholders, regardless of device or location.




Frame.io
: The recent acquisition of Frame.io combines Adobe’s industry-leading creative video editing software, Premiere Pro and After Effects, with Frame.io’s review and approval functionality to deliver a powerful collaboration platform that will radically accelerate the creative process. Frame.io’s cloud-native platform is a secure and elegant way to gather feedback from everyone involved in the video production process and will enable every stakeholder to effectively contribute to the creative process.



Photoshop (Beta) and Illustrator (Private Beta) on the web
: Browser-based experiences where millions of individuals, teams and stakeholders can view, share and comment on cloud documents on the web. Collaborators with a Photoshop subscription can make quick edits and retouch/adjust images, while Illustrator subscribers can access essential design tools and editing workflows using a set of early features.



Creative Cloud Spaces (Private Beta)

: A digital space built to fuel collaboration among teams, Creative Cloud Spaces simplifies decision-making by putting everything they need in one place. This includes project files, libraries and external links so everyone on the team has universal access to drive creative projects from start to finish. Spaces will be accessible across desktop and mobile through Creative Cloud Web and available in Photoshop, Illustrator, Fresco and XD.



Creative Cloud Canvas (Private Beta)
: To unlock a new level of collaboration, Canvases enable teams to lay out, visualize and review creative work together, in real time, without ever leaving the browser. On a Canvas, teams can place shapes, text, images and stickers, as well as linked documents from Creative Cloud apps, so anyone can make quick edits to the original creative in the corresponding app with a single click.



In addition, an all-new Workfront plugin for Photoshop gives creatives the ability to collaborate in context. Through an embedded Workfront update screen in Photoshop, creators can see tasks and issues, and post and view comments related to the project they’re working on.


Empowering Creative Careers


Adobe is supporting creators by enabling Creative Cloud subscribers to monetize their work through paid subscriptions on the Behance platform. Creators have full control over what they share, and the subscriptions are seamlessly integrated into Behance projects and livestreams, so creators can reserve any content for subscribers only. Creators keep 100% of their subscription revenue, with a 0% platform fee charged by Adobe.


Combating Misinformation: The Content Authenticity Initiative


Two years after introducing the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), Adobe is making its content attribution technology available to millions of customers. Through a CAI-driven feature called Content Credentials, attribution capabilities are now available in Photoshop, enabling users to turn on the opt-in feature to share content provenance details about their images; these include the creator’s identity, edits they’ve made and the time and place the photo was taken.


To ensure creators are getting credit for their work, the company is connecting the Content Credentials feature to NFT marketplaces for further attribution. Lastly, Adobe Stock will also automatically attach Content Credentials to images when they are downloaded.


Celebration of Creativity for All


Adobe MAX showcases a diverse roster of highly prolific creatives and entrepreneurs, including Jose Andres, Riz Ahmed, Zazie Beetz, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, Henry Golding, Casey Neistat, Tilda Swinton, Young Thug, Chloe Zhao and Imagine Dragons. Emmy Award-winning comedian and producer Kenan Thompson will host this year’s MAX Sneaks – a behind-the-scenes look at the experimental technology being developed in Adobe Labs.


MAX offers more than 400 content sessions and Labs, and 29 hours of global content designed to inspire and educate. To watch the keynote, attend global sessions and network with peers, visit max.adobe.com.

10,"Thursday, October 07, 2021 04:05 PM",Adobe Completes Acquisition of Frame.io,"
SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) today announced the completion of its acquisition of Frame.io, a leading cloud-based video collaboration platform. The combination of Adobe’s leading video editing offerings—including Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe After Effects—with Frame.io’s cloud-based review and approval functionality will radically accelerate the creative process and deliver an end-to-end video platform.


The skyrocketing demand for video means video teams must create an ever-increasing volume of content in close collaboration with dispersed stakeholders. Today, video review and approval processes are disjointed across multiple channels, leading to inefficient, time-intensive workflows. To address these inefficiencies, video tools need to be cloud-first with collaboration at the center, enabling every stakeholder to effectively contribute to the creative process with the appropriate controls, feedback mechanisms, and security.


With over a million users, Frame.io streamlines the video production process by enabling editors and key project stakeholders to seamlessly collaborate using cloud-first workflows. The addition of Frame.io creates an opportunity for Adobe, in conjunction with the partner ecosystem, to expand beyond video editors to a broader set of customers, teams and enterprises.


“With the growing importance of video, we’re proud to add Frame.io’s industry-leading, cloud-native workflow capabilities to Creative Cloud,” said Scott Belsky, chief product officer and executive vice president, Creative Cloud. “We are committed to enabling collaboration beyond Adobe’s applications to the growing number of third-party applications across the creative ecosystem, many of which Frame.io supports.”


Now that the acquisition is complete, Adobe together with Frame.io will make the creative process more collaborative, productive and efficient to further unleash creativity for all:



The acquisition of Frame.io brings Adobe Creative Cloud’s collaboration services to video and will make it easy for teams to collaborate across Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and other Adobe Creative Cloud applications.


All Creative Cloud customers will benefit from seamless collaboration on video projects with Frame.io workflow functionality built natively in Adobe Creative Cloud apps like Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects and Adobe Photoshop.


With the addition of Frame.io, Adobe will continue to collaborate across all stakeholders of creativity beyond Adobe’s applications that includes third-party applications in the entire creative ecosystem.



With the close of the transaction, Frame.io co-founder and CEO Emery Wells will continue to lead the Frame.io team, reporting to Scott Belsky as part of the Creative Cloud organization.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information


Adobe continues to provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but believes evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Adobe's operating results. Adobe believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management.


Adobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information as well as non-GAAP measures, which may exclude items such as stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles, investment gains and losses, the related tax impact of all of these items, income tax adjustments, and the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Adobe uses these non-GAAP measures in order to assess the performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods. Whenever such a non-GAAP measure is used, Adobe provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above.

13,"Wednesday, September 15, 2021 09:00 AM",Adobe Announces Payment Services for Adobe Commerce,"
SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
Adobe (Nasdaq: ADBE) today announced the upcoming availability of Payment Services for Adobe Commerce, the industry’s leading end-to-end commerce application for B2B, D2C and hybrid use cases. By integrating Payment Services to their digital storefronts, Adobe merchants of all sizes will soon have access to a robust, secure, and integrated payment solution that can easily be managed from their Adobe Commerce Admin, instead of having to do the work of integrating with third-party payment providers. Payment Services for Adobe Commerce will be powered by the PayPal Commerce Platform and available to Adobe merchants by the end of the year.


“In today’s fast-moving digital economy, organizations demand flexibility and extensibility in their commerce platform to sustain business growth and deliver seamless experiences for their customers,” said Amit Ahuja, vice president, Adobe Experience Cloud Product and Strategy at Adobe. “With the addition of Payment Services, we’re thrilled to expand on our already robust out-of-the-box commerce feature set to help Adobe Commerce merchants compete effectively and win in the digital-first economy.”


Merchant benefits of Payment Services for Adobe Commerce will include:



Easily Accept and Process Payment Methods: With Payment Services, Adobe merchants will be able to accept popular payment methods, including credit and debit cards, PayPal and Venmo to deliver the best checkout experience for their customers. In addition, merchants will also be able to offer PayPal pay later solutions in their storefront. According to Adobe Digital Economy Index, the use of buy now, pay later (BNPL) services in the first half of 2021 grew 88% compared to 2019 levels.


Fully-Integrated Payment Experience: Payment Services will be a fully-integrated experience for merchants in which all payment and transaction data will be readily accessible within the Adobe Commerce Admin. Merchants will no longer have to contend with multiple logins and other disjointed user experiences for their payment processing, such as exporting and importing reports from multiple systems to reconcile, analyze, and verify sales information.


Competitive Processing Fees: Merchants will have access to convenient and competitive pricing for transactions with tiered rates based on processing volume.


Advanced Financial Reporting Capability: Payment Services will offer comprehensive reporting capabilities to provide merchants with a clear view of their store’s orders and payments, including details about processed volume, payment balance and transaction-level reporting for financial reconciliation. With this reporting, merchants will be able to better run their business and spot anomalies in order placements and post-sales flows more efficiently. In addition, merchants will be able to see the complete order flow from when an order is placed, all the way to settlement in a single dashboard.


Always Up-to-Date and Secure: As Payment Services will be developed and supported by Adobe, merchants will always have access to services that are up-to-date, safe, and stable. Merchants won’t have to deal with third-party payment processor extension compatibility issues when updating to the latest version of Adobe Commerce.



By utilizing the PayPal Commerce Platform, Adobe merchants will be able to accept current payment methods – such as PayPal and Venmo – as well as leverage PayPal’s ongoing investment in payment innovations such as support for cryptocurrency transactions and local payment methods in the future.


“As digital commerce represents a growing share of all transactions, merchants are looking for tools that enable them to drive front-end capabilities and back-end operations of their digital storefronts. Payments is one of those key capabilities that we saw grow in importance over the past 18 months,” said Jordan Jewell, research director, digital commerce at IDC. “With payment capabilities now in its product portfolio, Adobe is better-positioned to support its merchants as a platform provider that can streamline commerce operations across the customer journey.”


Timing and Availability 


Payment Services will be available to merchants in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2021. The feature will also be accessible to merchants using Magento Open Source.


Support for additional territories, including Canada, Australia, and Western Europe, are planned for 2022.

Acquisition Brings Together Adobe Creative Cloud’s Leading Video Capabilities with Frame.io’s Cloud-first Workflow Functionality to Create End-to-End Video Collaboration Platform

 SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Frame.io, a leading cloud-based video collaboration platform. With over a million users across media and entertainment companies, agencies, and global brands, Frame.io streamlines the video production process by enabling video editors and key project stakeholders to seamlessly collaborate using cloud-first workflows. The combination of Adobe’s industry-leading creative software, including Premiere Pro and After Effects video editing products, and Frame.io’s review and approval functionality, will deliver a collaboration platform that powers the video editing process.


Whether it's the latest binge-worthy streaming series, a social media video that sparks a movement, or a corporate video that connects thousands of remote workers, video creation and consumption is experiencing tremendous growth. Video teams must produce an ever-increasing volume of content, and each video project requires various stakeholders, including video editors, producers, agencies, and clients. Today’s video workflows are disjointed with multiple tools and communication channels being used to solicit stakeholder feedback. Frame.io eliminates the inefficiencies of video workflows by enabling real-time footage upload, access, and in-line stakeholder collaboration in a secure and elegant experience across surfaces.



Collaboration is the next wave of creativity: Digital collaboration is now the foundation of all creative endeavors. Adobe’s acquisition of Frame.io brings Adobe Creative Cloud’s collaboration services to video and builds on recent innovations for creative collaboration including Adobe Creative Cloud Libraries, Cloud Documents, Design Systems in Adobe XD, Adobe Stock, and Adobe Fonts, all of which together with Frame.io, will make it easy for teams to collaborate across Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and other Adobe Creative Cloud applications.




Video workflows must empower all stakeholders: With the combination of Frame.io and Adobe, Creative Cloud customers, from video editors, to producers, to marketers, will benefit from seamless collaboration on video projects with Frame.io workflow functionality built natively in Adobe Creative Cloud applications like Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects, and Adobe Photoshop.




Innovation benefits the video ecosystem: Frame.io customers and partners will benefit from the company’s robust plug-ins and third-party application support along with the innovation generated by the combined Adobe Creative Cloud and Frame.io teams. With the addition of Frame.io, Adobe Creative Cloud’s commitment to enabling collaboration across all stakeholders of creativity extends beyond Adobe’s applications to the growing number of third-party applications across the creative ecosystem.



“We’ve entered a new era of connected creativity that is deeply collaborative, and we imagine a world where everyone can participate in the creative process,” said Scott Belsky, Chief Product Officer and Executive Vice President, Creative Cloud. “With this acquisition, we’re welcoming an incredible customer-oriented team and adding Frame.io’s cloud-native workflow capabilities to make the creative process more collaborative, productive, and efficient to further unleash creativity for all.”


“Frame.io and Adobe share a vision for the future of video creation and collaboration that brings together Adobe’s strength in video creation and production and Frame.io’s cloud-native platform,” said Emery Wells, Frame.io co-founder and CEO. “We’re excited to join Adobe to continue to drive video innovation for the world’s leading media and entertainment companies, agencies, and brands.”


Upon close, Frame.io co-founder and CEO Emery Wells and co-founder John Traver will join Adobe. Wells will continue to lead the Frame.io team, reporting to Scott Belsky. The transaction, valued at $1.275 billion, subject to customary purchase price adjustments, is expected to close during the fourth quarter of Adobe’s 2021 fiscal year and is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. Until the transaction closes, each company will continue to operate independently.

15,"Thursday, July 22, 2021 09:00 AM",Adobe Launches Adobe Analytics for Higher Education to Advance Digital Literacy,"

Next Generation Adobe Education Exchange Program Provides Adobe Analytics and Course Curriculum to Colleges and Universities Worldwide for Free
 SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) today announced the Adobe Analytics curriculum for education, a global program that supports the future workforce with in-demand data science skills. As part of the next generation of the Adobe Education Exchange, college instructors and students will be able to use Adobe Analytics—the industry-leading customer data analytics platform—for free and get access to course curriculum with hands-on activities. Students will learn how to use data to drive business decisions and gain skills for careers spanning data science to marketing and product management. The program is an extension of the Adobe Creative Campus program, which advances digital literacy through access to Adobe Creative Cloud in the classroom.


“Adobe is driving digital transformation for major brands in every sector, and the one thing we consistently hear is how difficult it is to hire the right talent,” said Amit Ahuja, vice president, Experience Cloud Platform and Products at Adobe. “Digital literacy is paramount for students in today’s digital economy, and this program meets the needs of today’s employers while exposing students to careers they may not have considered.”


The program was developed through the Adobe Analytics Challenge, which launched in 2005. The popular competition gives college students a chance to work with real data to solve business challenges, from companies such as Nike, Major League Baseball and Sony Playstation. Past participants have used the experience to land careers at The Home Depot, Boston Consulting Group, Amazon and nonprofits like Learning Forward. The success of the event drove interest from higher education instructors, who wanted to include elements of the Challenge in their coursework.


Professors from institutions including the University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of Utah and University of Michigan partnered with Adobe to develop the curriculum, helping shape the program to ensure it is easy to implement among any college or university.


“The pandemic reshaped economies and exposed consumers to a digital-only reality, pushing organizations to transform themselves on a dime and seek new types of talent,” said Neeraj Arora, professor of marketing, University of Wisconsin-Madison. “The digital skills that students can acquire through Adobe’s program will greatly help them succeed in career fields such as marketing.”


“The ability to deliver great digital experiences is absolutely crucial for corporations, government agencies and small businesses alike,” said Paul Hu, David Eccles chair professor, the University of Utah. “Data is a valuable asset in today’s digital economy, and Adobe Analytics curriculum for education will play a major role in helping students acquire skillsets that significantly broaden their career opportunities and development.”


The program has four core modules that can be incorporated into any curriculum. Participants get access to a sandbox environment, which allows students to use Adobe Analytics with rich demo data. It is meant to be self-paced, and instructors can pick and choose any of the modules to incorporate into their coursework. The modules focus on:



Data Collection: Organizations have to connect data from different sources and across departments such as marketing, customer service, sales, human resources and more – all of which require proper governance and privacy controls. In this module, students will learn the fundamentals of data collection, warehousing and cleaning, as well as implementation.


Data Strategy and Architecture: Once data is collected, teams have to set up a data structure to make the data consumable across an organization. Students can combine metrics across consumer touchpoints, for instance, to understand how promotional offers online drive in-store foot traffic. It also gives students a chance to define key performance indicators and shape how goals are structured and achieved.


Standard Metrics and Functionality: This module focuses on reporting and how data is presented to an organization at large, spanning functions such as marketing, product development, eCommerce and design. Students will continue to layer meaning into numbers and showcase how insights can drive real action.


Analysis Workspace Fundamentals: Analysis Workspace is a unique drag-and-drop interface in Adobe Analytics. Inspired by Photoshop, users can curate different data sets and take on a detective role in uncovering data anomalies and other insights. This module provides students an opportunity to curate data, collaborate with others, produce new visualizations and uncover insights that advance business objectives.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information


Adobe continues to provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but believes evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Adobe's operating results. Adobe believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management.


Adobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information as well as non-GAAP measures, which may exclude items such as stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles, investment gains and losses, the related tax impact of all of these items, income tax adjustments, and the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Adobe uses these non-GAAP measures in order to assess the performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods. Whenever such a non-GAAP measure is used, Adobe provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above.

18,"Wednesday, June 02, 2021 04:05 PM",Adobe Appoints David Wadhwani as Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer of Its Digital Media Business,"
SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) today announced the appointment of David Wadhwani as executive vice president and chief business officer, Digital Media. In this role, Wadhwani will be responsible for the success of Adobe’s global Digital Media business across Adobe Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud, including all product marketing, strategic partnerships, customer support and go-to-market across geographies, working closely with the Digital Media Product organizations. He will report directly to Adobe president and CEO Shantanu Narayen. Wadhwani previously served as senior vice president and general manager of Adobe’s Digital Media business from 2010 to 2015.


Everyone has a story to tell, and Creative Cloud is providing everyone, from the student to the most demanding professional, with the tools, platform and community to create and amplify their stories. In a world where work needs to be done from anywhere and with anyone, Document Cloud is accelerating document productivity, redefining how people view, edit, share, scan and sign documents across every surface.


By delivering continuous product innovation, executing a rigorous data-driven digital business and expanding into new categories, geographies and customer segments, Creative Cloud and Document Cloud target an addressable market that Adobe estimates to be approximately $62 billion by 2023.


“We’re thrilled to welcome David back to Adobe to lead our Digital Media business. He is a transformational leader with an exceptional record of operational excellence, innovation and growth,” said Shantanu Narayen, president and CEO, Adobe. “David’s extensive experience, impressive track record and passion for Adobe and our customers make him the ideal choice to lead the explosive creativity and document categories through their next phase of growth.”


“I’m excited to return to Adobe at a time when digital content is becoming the foundation of expression and engagement for everyone, from individual artists, storytellers and business owners, to the largest global brands,” said David Wadhwani. “Creative Cloud and Document Cloud are helping millions around the world express themselves and digitize their workflows in innovative ways.

“The pandemic has shown that brands that put a laser focus on customer experience management come out in front,” said Anil Chakravarthy, executive vice president and general manager, Digital Experience Business and Worldwide Field Operations, Adobe. “Adobe Experience Cloud with its new innovations released today is bringing businesses closer to their customers—enabling them to deliver the best digital experiences at speed and scale.”


Adobe Experience Platform Momentum


Without strong data management, companies lack an effective approach to connect with customers in real-time. Adobe Experience Platform, at the heart of Adobe Experience Cloud, allows customers to collect disparate data from across the enterprise, enrich that data with actionable customer insights, and stitch data together for more complete, real-time customer profiles so that every experience is better than the last. Today, Adobe Experience Platform powers Adobe Experience Cloud applications and delivers real-time personalization at scale with more than 17 trillion audience segment evaluations every day.


New Innovations in Adobe Experience Cloud 


Adobe Experience Cloud, which is used by 75% of Fortune 100 companies today, is powering Customer Experience Management (CXM) for B2B and B2C companies with applications focused on customer journey management, data insights and audiences, content and personalization, commerce and marketing workflows. Innovations to help businesses accelerate their digital transformation include:



New Adobe Journey Optimizer: Consumers want to connect in a way that feels personalized and relevant throughout their unique journey, but brands struggle with providing context-aware experiences in real-time, at scale. The new Adobe Journey Optimizer, built on Adobe Experience Platform, is the industry’s only enterprise application designed to help marketers optimize the customer journey across any outbound or inbound customer touchpoint. Brands can now actively listen to customer signals and use intelligent decisioning to anticipate and deliver the most relevant journey at scale by bringing together audience-based outbound marketing with one-on-one engagement.


Next Generation Adobe Real-time CDP:With consumers becoming increasingly attentive to what type of data they are willing to share and third-party cookies in browsers going away, quality first-party data is the best way for marketers to build trusted relationships with customers. Adobe’s next generation Real-time CDP is the only enterprise application architected from the ground up for first-party, data-driven customer acquisition and engagement. And, available today, the B2B edition of Adobe Real-time CDP allows customers to bring together both individual and account profiles for complete intelligence and activation to help B2B companies think and act like B2C brands.


New Customer Journey Analytics: Successful enterprises need a data-driven approach to know their customers and to continuously optimize engagement in a way that ensures each experience is better than the last. New Customer Journey Analytics is the industry’s first enterprise application that allows brands to integrate and standardize their online and offline customer data, enabling anyone—not just data scientists—to connect that data, easily visualize it in a unified view, and better understand the entire journey to better inform marketing strategies.


New Marketing System of Record: Work management solutions must help companies run more efficiently by centralizing work in a single application, so cross-functional teams can connect, collaborate, and execute the right work—from anywhere. Following Adobe’s acquisition of Workfront, Adobe previewed its new Marketing System of Record, which will be the single source of truth for connecting and managing work across the entire marketing lifecycle, from strategy and planning to execution and measurement.


New Adobe Experience Manager Innovations: New innovations within Adobe Experience Manager help brands create, manage and optimize the content businesses require at the velocity needed to stay ahead. This includes Headless Content Management System (CMS) capabilities, which deliver immersive content as data over APIs and bring advanced AI to content automation. The new Adobe Experience Manager Assets Essentials will become the default asset management capability in all Adobe Experience Cloud applications and be fully configurable to ensure access to the best content.


New Adobe Commerce Capabilities: Companies are increasingly relying on digital commerce as the dominant channel to drive business growth. Powered by Adobe Sensei, Product Recommendations in Adobe Commerce unlock new ways for customers to discover products and Live Search delivers fast and hyper-relevant results and search experiences on the merchant’s site. A new collaboration with FedEx will let Adobe Commerce merchants integrate their storefronts with FedEx ShopRunner, allowing them to offer consumer benefits such as free two-day shipping, seamless checkout, easy returns, and the ability to access FedEx post-purchase logistics intelligence.


New Adobe Experience Platform Collection Enterprise:Companies need access to real-time consumer behavioral data to drive decisions that impact real-time experiences at scale. Collecting behavioral data is cumbersome, difficult to manage, and traditional approaches often lead to poor application performance, negatively impacting the consumer experience. New Collection Enterprise allows companies to use Adobe’s globally distributed, high-performance edge network for collecting data and sending it wherever it needs to go, whether that be to Adobe’s applications and platform or any other system. And the new lightweight data collection SDKs help ensure that applications are highly performant to provide the best consumer experience.

20,"Tuesday, April 27, 2021 09:00 AM",Adobe Announces Industry’s First CDP Architected For First-Party Data,"

Major Brands Partner With Adobe to Deliver Personalized Customer Experiences in a World Without Third-Party Cookies
 SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) today announced the next generation of its Real-time Customer Data Platform (CDP), the only enterprise application architected from the ground up for first-party data-driven customer acquisition and engagement. Adobe Real-time CDP helps brands activate known and unknown customer data to manage the entire customer profile and journey seamlessly in one system, without the need for third-party cookies.


The relationship between consumers and brands is rapidly evolving. Consumers today are more attentive to the data they share, which has resulted in a patchwork of privacy regulations globally. At the same time, expectations for personalized brand experiences remain at an all-time high, while third-party cookies, which marketers have historically relied on to track unknown visitors, will no longer be supported in browsers. This means brands will have to contend with reduced insight about unknown visitors to their digital properties while still trying to provide a compelling customer experience.


In light of these changes, it is imperative for companies to recalibrate their customer acquisition strategy to place quality, permission-based first-party data at the center of all their customer engagements. Adopting a first-party data strategy allows them to provide customers with the most relevant, personalized experience by only using the information that customers choose to share. And yet, a recent survey of digital marketers shows that despite optimism around the benefits of first-party data, marketers believe they have tapped only 47% of their first-party data potential.


“As consumers, we now expect personalized brand experiences while being in control of the data we share,” said Anil Chakravarthy, executive vice president and general manager, Digital Experience Business and Worldwide Field Operations at Adobe. “With Adobe Real-time CDP, we are partnering with brands to deliver relevant, responsive and respectful experiences through first-party data.”


Using First-Party Data to Power CXM



A Centralized Hub for First-Party Data: Adobe Real-time CDP serves as a centralized hub for brands to bring together varying types of first-party event and attribute data to form a more complete view of their customers. It allows brands to combine first-party web, app and media data (from publishers) coming from interactions such as a prospect’s web browsing activity, as well as emails or phone numbers from customers who opt to register on a brand’s site. As additional data is added and richer customer profiles are built, brands can use Adobe Target to personalize experiences. In addition, out-of-box data governance capabilities help brands ensure that data usage policies are strictly enforced and followed by everyone in an organization.




Real-Time, Machine-Learning Powered Personalization at Scale: Encouraging an unknown visitor to register on a brand’s site with their email or phone number can be a challenge. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach as every customer’s journey is different. As Adobe Real-time CDP allows brands to build a prospect’s profile based on brand interactions, Adobe Target ingests available data and orchestrates in real-time the next best content, offer or experience, including identifying the right moment in between clicks to trigger registration and consent from the unknown visitor. In addition, Adobe Target allows brands to bring prospects’ propensity scores (the likelihood that a visitor will perform certain actions like a purchase) from Adobe Real-time CDP into Adobe Target to deliver relevant experiences that will likely turn a prospect into a customer.




Segment Match: New Segment Match lets brands collaborate to expand their own first-party data sets through partnerships. It allows marketers to securely enrich their matching first-party profiles with segment metadata for better insights and improved personalization. For example, an apparel retailer may partner with a jewelry brand to exchange non-sensitive segment data about their matching customers, like the type of dresses that a subset of their customers is buying so that the jewelry brand can recommend accessories for those groups. The non-sensitive customer data can only be referenced in Segment Match when the customers for both the apparel retailer and the jewelry brand permit them.




Look-Alike Segments: New Look-alike Segments allow brands to identify additional customers who share similar attributes to their best-known customers. For example, using a sample audience of existing customers, marketers can build a look-alike segment that consists of other customers within the brand’s database who share comparable traits. Another way to use Look-alike Segments is in tandem with Segment Match. In this instance, a brand can identify and send a sample audience of existing customers to a Segment Match partner. Based on the data, the partner can build a look-alike segment that consists of other customers within the partner’s own database who share similar characteristics and have granted permission for the partner to use their data.




New B2B CDP Capabilities: In today’s increasingly digital economy, B2B companies must find new ways to connect with customers across an ever-expanding set of touchpoints in a personalized, relevant way and do it at scale. Available today, the B2B edition of Adobe Real-time CDP brings together both individual and account profiles for complete intelligence and activation to help B2B companies think and act like B2C brands.



“No customer experience initiative will be successful without a data infrastructure to support it,” said Gerry Murray, research director, marketing and sales technology at IDC. “Customers expect brands to act as one regardless of where, when, how or with whom they interact. The only way to do that is by making customer data an enterprise service free from application and departmental silos with a solution like Adobe’s Real-time CDP.”


“The preservation of our customers’ privacy has long been a priority for IBM,"" said Jason Andrews, vice president for digital marketing at IBM. ""With first-party data rising in importance in this new era, we place tremendous value on our close collaboration with strategic partners such as Adobe to put the interests of consumers at the forefront of what we do.”


“As a customer-obsessed company, we recognize the vital role that first-party data plays in helping to contextualize our customers’ journeys to ultimately deliver a winning brand experience,” said Josh Rab, vice president, marketing technology at Intuit. “Intuit has been a long-standing Adobe customer, and we’re excited to extend this partnership as we ramp up our data strategy and raise the bar for the type of brand experience that Intuit offers.”

 SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX) today announced a new, multi-year collaboration starting with the integration of ShopRunner, a leading e-commerce platform and subsidiary of FedEx Services, with Adobe Commerce.

Adobe’s collaboration with FedEx and ShopRunner will help brands and merchants better manage their shipping and logistics and allow them to offer a great last-mile delivery experience as a way to retain customers and build loyalty.

The latest partnership with FedEx should assist merchants to better meet, and exceed, these lofty customer expectations by enabling more frictionless commerce.”


Timing and Availability


Plans are that Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source merchants in the U.S. will be able to download the FedEx extension from the Magento Marketplace in late 2021.

World’s Leading Brands Rely on Adobe Experience Cloud to Deliver Personalized Digital Healthcare Services
 SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
With the past year illuminating that access to healthcare is more important than ever, Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) today announced that the leading companies in the healthcare sector turn to Adobe Experience Cloud to transform their customer experience. With every business now a digital business, healthcare organizations rely on digital channels to reach customers with critical information and services in real time. Adobe is now powering digital experiences for seven of the top 10 healthcare providers, eight of the top 10 healthcare payers and nine of the top 10 pharmaceutical companies—delivering experiences with agility and at scale. Adobe Summit 2021 will feature Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla and Walgreens Group Vice President of Customer Marketing Platforms Alyssa Raine discussing how to lead in the digital economy.


“The pandemic has forever altered how healthcare is delivered, which now includes high consumer expectations for timely and personalized care,” says Anil Chakravarthy, executive vice president and general manager, Digital Experience Business and Worldwide Field Operations, Adobe. “Leveraging Adobe Experience Cloud, with privacy and security top of mind, healthcare can be delivered in real time at scale, with the individualized service that consumers expect today.”


“Because health is deeply personal to each consumer, the healthcare experience needs to be tailored to fit the needs of Walgreens Boots Alliance’s 120 million customers and patients,” said Alyssa Raine, group vice president of Customer Marketing Platforms at Walgreens. “The power of Adobe’s technology allows us to understand our customers and deliver the unique experiences our customers need to live healthy lives.”


Adobe’s enterprise applications, including HIPAA-ready Adobe Experience Cloud applications such as Adobe Experience Manager Managed Services, Marketo Engage and Adobe Sign, allow deeper end-user engagement across multiple touchpoints.

With Adobe Experience Manager, Thermo Fisher instantly launched COVID-19 webpages with essential updates on the pandemic, clinical diagnostic kits for scientists and information on the company’s research-based solutions.



Mercy Health
 partnered with Adobe to deliver a retail-like healthcare experience. Adobe Experience Manager delivers the latest web content to patients, making it easy to visit Mercy’s website to access self-service information online. When the pandemic began, Mercy quickly pivoted to offering a symptom screener that new patients could go through anonymously for virtual diagnoses.


Change Healthcare, a technology company that specializes in data and analytics solutions for healthcare organizations, tapped Adobe to reinvent the way it sells software to its healthcare customers. The Change Healthcare®Marketplace uses Adobe Commerce for shopping cart capability and the Change Healthcare website uses Adobe Experience Manager for content management.

24,"Friday, April 16, 2021 02:38 AM",Adobe Co-Founder Dr. Geschke Passes at 81,"
SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
It is with profound sadness that Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) shares the passing of the company’s beloved co-founder, Dr. Charles Geschke. Dr. Geschke passed away on Friday, surrounded by his family.


Dr. Geschke co-founded Adobe in 1982 with Dr. John Warnock, a colleague from Xerox. Their first product was Adobe PostScript, a pivotal technology that sparked the desktop publishing revolution. Dr. Geschke was chief operating officer of Adobe from December 1986 to July 1994 and president from April 1989 until his retirement in April 2000. He served as chairman of the board with Dr. Warnock from September 1997 to January 2017 and a member of the board until April 2020, when he transitioned to become emeritus board member. In recognition of his technical achievements, Dr. Geschke was awarded the prestigious National Medal of Technology and Innovation, the Computer Entrepreneur Award from the IEEE Computer Society, and the American Electronics Association Medal of Honor.


Dr. Warnock, Adobe co-founder, former CEO and Chairman of the Board, shared the following: “I could never have imagined having a better, more likable, or more capable business partner. Not having Chuck in our lives will leave a huge hole and those who knew him will all agree.”


Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen sent the following email to all Adobe employees:


It is with profound sadness that I share that our beloved co-founder Dr. Chuck Geschke, has passed away at the age of 81, leaving an indelible mark on our company and the world. 


This is a huge loss for the entire Adobe community and the technology industry, for whom he has been a guide and hero for decades. 


As co-founders of Adobe, Chuck and John Warnock developed groundbreaking software that has revolutionized how people create and communicate. Their first product was Adobe PostScript, an innovative technology that provided a radical new way to print text and images on paper and sparked the desktop publishing revolution. Chuck instilled a relentless drive for innovation in the company, resulting in some of the most transformative software inventions, including the ubiquitous PDF, Acrobat, Illustrator, Premiere Pro and Photoshop. 


In recognition of his technical achievements, Chuck was awarded the prestigious National Medal of Technology and Innovation, the Computer Entrepreneur Award from the IEEE Computer Society, and the American Electronics Association Medal of Honor. After 18 years sharing the helm of Adobe, Chuck retired in 2000 and continued to serve on the Board of Directors until last year, when he transitioned to become emeritus board member.


As much as his inventions changed the world, it is his focus on people, purpose and culture that has profoundly impacted each of us at Adobe. As he always said, Chuck wanted to create a company where he would want to work. He believed that good ideas come from everywhere in the company and that it’s not only what we do but how we do it that matters most. He dedicated much of his time and talent to various philanthropies and community organizations throughout his lifetime. 


I spoke to John earlier today and he had this to share about their five-decade partnership: “In 1982, Chuck and I agreed that we should leave Xerox and start our own company. That was the beginning of Adobe. I could never have imagined having a better, more likable, or more capable business partner. Not having Chuck in our lives will leave a huge hole and those who knew him will all agree.”


I admired his brilliance, kindness and values that defined his character and am grateful that I had the privilege to know and work with him. His absence will certainly leave a huge hole in my heart. 


As I grieve the loss of my long-time role model, mentor and friend, I am comforted knowing that Adobe’s best days are ahead – exactly as Chuck would want them to be. 


Shantanu

Company Achieves Record Quarterly Revenue Across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud
 SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) today reported financial results for its first quarter fiscal year 2021 ended March 5, 2021.


First Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Financial Highlights



Adobe achieved record quarterly revenue of $3.91 billion in its first quarter of fiscal year 2021, which represents 26 percent year-over-year growth. Diluted earnings per share was $2.61 on a GAAP basis, representing 33 percent year-over-year growth, and $3.14 on a non-GAAP basis, representing 38 percent year-over-year growth.


Digital Media segment revenue was $2.86 billion, which represents 32 percent year-over-year growth. Creative revenue grew to $2.38 billion, representing 31 percent year-over-year growth. Document Cloud revenue was $480 million, representing 37 percent year-over-year growth.


Digital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) increased $435 million quarter-over-quarter to $10.69 billion exiting the quarter. Creative ARR grew to $9.12 billion and Document Cloud ARR grew to $1.57 billion.


Digital Experience segment revenue was $934 million, representing 24 percent year-over-year growth. Digital Experience subscription revenue was $812 million, representing 27 percent year-over-year growth.


GAAP operating income in the first quarter was $1.45 billion, and non-GAAP operating income was $1.83 billion. GAAP net income was $1.26 billion, and non-GAAP net income was $1.52 billion.


Cash flows from operations were $1.77 billion.


Remaining Performance Obligation (“RPO”) exiting the quarter was $11.61 billion, representing 17 percent year-over-year growth.


Adobe repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares during the quarter.

A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided at the end of this press release and on Adobe’s website.

Adobe continues to provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but believes evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Adobe's operating results. Adobe believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management.


Adobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information as well as non-GAAP measures, which may exclude items such as stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles, investment gains and losses, the related tax impact of all of these items, income tax adjustments, and the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Adobe uses these non-GAAP measures in order to assess the performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods. Whenever such a non-GAAP measure is used, Adobe provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above.

27,"Thursday, March 11, 2021 09:00 AM",Adobe Partners With All 50 US States to Modernize Digital Experiences for Citizens,"
SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) today unveiled it is partnering with government agencies in all 50 states to power their digital modernization through Adobe Experience Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud. The partnerships exist across individual agencies at the state, county and city levels. Using Adobe Experience Cloud, governments are revamping their online presence, making their websites and apps easier to navigate, ensuring content is personalized and updated in real-time, and creating intuitive forms that work on any device. Governments have also adopted Adobe Document Cloud to optimize internal document workflows and Adobe Sign to power the entire e-signature process, reducing time spent on tasks such as applying for benefits, and drastically reducing paper waste.


“The COVID-19 pandemic greatly accelerated efforts to improve government services online, and popular consumer services now set the bar for experience quality across the board,” said Anil Chakravarthy, executive vice president and general manager, Digital Experience Business and Worldwide Field Operations, Adobe. “The public sector has unique hurdles from scalability to security, and Adobe’s FedRAMP-authorized solutions are tailored to address them while helping ensure ease-of-use and equitable access for citizens.”


The adoption of Adobe tools is also helping government agencies adhere to more sustainable business practices. For example, through resource-free workflows, Adobe Document Cloud turns 30 billion paper documents in the U.S. each year into digital documents. 

Adobe is also sharing an update on its Government Rapid Response Program, first introduced to support continuity during the pandemic when consumers rushed online to access government services. As vaccines ramp up, Adobe supports agencies and companies as they work to accelerate distribution. Adobe tools can be used to streamline enrollment tasks such as eligibility determination, appointment scheduling and personalized reminders, while e-signatures expedite document requests and minimize fraud. And with a greater need to inform the public on vaccine developments and guidance, Adobe can help teams manage and deliver content across web, email, mobile messaging and other channels.


Partnerships with state, county and city agencies include:



In California, Los Angeles County is home to over 10 million residents; one in three people rely on the Department of Public Social Services (DPSS), the largest agency of its kind in the U.S. The agency tapped Adobe Experience Cloud to revamp its website, a digital “front door” that became crucial when shelter-in-place orders took effect. The new experience is easier to navigate and mobile-friendly.


The State of Oklahoma partnered with Adobe to drive its web modernization project. A new oklahoma.gov site, powered by Adobe Experience Cloud, became a one-stop shop for any service—from financial assistance to getting a fishing permit. The state is also using Adobe Sign to support its remote workforce with automated e-signatures and digital document processing.


The State of Iowa, through the Iowa Economic Development Authority (IEDA), has previously awarded over $52.2 million in grant assistance for small businesses. With Adobe Sign, the state quickly received applications and turned around payment distribution. In the first four weeks of the portal going live, roughly 20,000 transactions were completed.


In California, the City of Sacramento relies on digital channels to engage its half-million residents. Adobe Sign and Adobe Experience Manager Forms provide paperless processes that save constituents time and energy. The city tapped Adobe Campaign to revamp its email program, a key communication channel for COVID-19 updates and more. Through better insights and personalization, the subscriber base has grown by 30%, with an open rate of over 24%.


The State of Utah enacted a teleworking initiative to drive greater efficiency in its government. With Adobe Sign, employees could work remotely, with less environmental impact than that of paper workflows. During the pandemic, this minimized disruption for residents, with over 2,500 employees quickly transitioning to remote work and accelerating turnaround on over 5,000 documents in an initial 30-day period.


At the federal level, Adobe Experience Cloud was used by the U.S. Census Bureau to power the delivery, measurement and personalization of the first online Census in 2020. This initiative was recognized at the ATC-IAC Igniting Innovation 2020 Conference and Awards for the “greatest magnitude of results and benefits,” as the Bureau could save at least $55 million for every 1% increase in digital responses.


Adobe is working with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at a pivotal point in the pandemic, helping the agency understand what constituents are looking for on the CDC website via Adobe Analytics and driving email communications on vaccine guidance and prevention methods through Adobe Campaign.



Additional Updates 



Adobe Experience Manager Forms as a Cloud Service: Government agencies rely on Adobe Experience Manager to deliver scalable and resilient websites that meet the needs of the public. With the availability of Adobe Experience Manager Forms as a Cloud Service, Adobe is helping further accelerate these digital initiatives. When Adobe first took its creative tools from a boxed software to the cloud, it meant faster access to new features and a high level of security. A cloud-native application will extend the same benefits to government forms. Agencies can deliver an engaging digital forms experience for consumers that is highly scalable, renders beautifully on any device, and integrates with Adobe Sign.


Digital Government Study: Adobe surveyed more than 1,000 U.S. consumers to better understand how the pandemic impacted government websites and citizen preferences. The study highlights a general desire for more information and direct communication from government agencies, while also showing the impact of digital experiences on consumer sentiment around favorability and trustworthiness.

28,"Tuesday, April 12, 2022 09:00 AM",Adobe Introduces Frame.io for Creative Cloud and Updates to After Effects and Premiere Pro,"


Frame.io’s industry leading-collaboration tools now available to Creative Cloud members


Premiere Pro and After Effects now the only professional video creation tools to include integrated review and approval and Camera to Cloud workflows


After Effects now includes Native M1 Support; Premiere Pro Import, Header Bar and Export experience is reimagined

 SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) today announced it is bringing Frame.io’s industry-leading video collaboration platform to its millions of Creative Cloud customers and released updates to After Effects and Premiere Pro, including native M1 support for After Effects. With the introduction of Frame.io for Creative Cloud, video editors and key project stakeholders – including producers, agencies and clients – are able to collaborate seamlessly in the cloud. This is the industry’s first integrated review and approval workflow for post-production, allowing editors to get to final approval faster and easier than ever before. Demand for video collaboration solutions is on the rise in a digital economy where more content is being created than ever before and remote teamwork is becoming the new normal.


Now, as part of a Creative Cloud subscription, video creators can:



Share work in progress with an unlimited number of reviewers anywhere in the world.


Get frame-accurate comments and annotations directly inside of Premiere Pro and After Effects, all without leaving their timeline.


Use Frame.io accelerated file transfer technology for fast uploading and downloading of media with 100GB of dedicated Frame.io storage.


Work on up to five different projects concurrently with another remote user.


Work with Camera to Cloud – the fastest, easiest and most secure way to get footage from cameras to editors, motion designers and other stakeholders.



“The combination of Premiere Pro and Frame.io gives customers the world’s only end-to-end solution for video creation from ingest to editorial to output,” said Steve Warner, vice president of Digital Video and Audio at Adobe. “This is the first step toward building a powerful, cloud-based platform for the future of video creation.”


Notable filmmakers are already seeing the benefits of remote collaboration with Premiere Pro and Frame.io. A24’s Everything Everywhere All At Once, in theaters now, used the two solutions in their workflow. The film’s editor Paul Rogers stated, “Premiere Pro is wonderful and I couldn’t imagine cutting in any other program. Combined with Frame.io, the whole workflow was very intuitive. I was able to focus on the film, not the tools.” Recent Premiere Pro projects of note include: A24’s After Yangand The Green Knight, the ACADEMY AWARD® nominated film Ascension,FX’sAtlantaand more.


New Updates in After Effects and Premiere Pro to Work Faster and More Efficiently


The latest release of the Adobe Creative Cloud video applications is also available starting today, offering new features and workflow refinements that help video pros and social storytellers create compelling content. The updates include:


After Effects:





Native M1 Support




now launches up to seven times faster and renders compositions twice as fast on M1 Macs compared to an Intel 10-core iMac Pro. This unlocks more creative possibilities for motion designers as they are now able to iterate their work faster than ever.




Scene Edit Detection



 Powered by Adobe Sensei
 uses the latest artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technology to automatically detect scene changes in an edited clip and places them as individual layers or creates markers at edit points for faster project setup.



Extended Viewer
 enables users to view 2D and 3D layers located outside a frame’s edge when using the Draft 3D engine; see more of the design, navigate 3D space; and move 3D layers more easily. Users can hide or dim the area beyond the frame to get a look at the final shot.




Binning Indicators for 3D Layers

 show which3D layers render together in the same 3D space, enabling them to intersect and cast shadows on each other. This gives users a visual map of how After Effects composites 2D and 3D layers together.



Premiere Pro:




Reimagined Import, Header Bar and Export Experience
 - Following a successful public Beta, the redesigned core workflows are now more intuitive and visual:
Import focuses on media rather than project settings, letting video creators easily scan and scrub files for assembling media from different locations. This makes it faster for pros and easier for new users to get started.
Header Bar provides a cleaner, more centralized navigation so users can quickly switch between the core tasks of import, editing and exporting.
Exportlets users quickly upload media directly to popular destinations like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. It features smart presets that take the guess work out of encoding and preparing files for delivery, making it easier for both new users and pros to deliver content.




Auto Color Powered by Adobe Sensei
 uses AI to generate first-pass color corrections. It acts as a guide to help new content creators become familiar with adjustments. It is also a jumping off point for experienced users to fast track their color correction before moving on to secondary color tasks, like skin tone or sky adjustments. Auto Color was introduced as Auto Tone in Premiere Pro public beta in 2021.



Performance and Workflow Improvements
 include the ability to show and hide markers by color, a Remix progress indicator for audio clips and improved trim mode playback looping.



New Free Adobe Stock Assets
including thousands of HD video footage, motion graphics templates and more, are now available in app to help create videos that stand out.



For more details, please go to the Premiere Pro and After Effects blog.


Attendees at this year’s NAB Show can get a closer look at the newly available features and hear from industry experts at the Adobe and Frame.io booth (#N3404, North Hall and #C9520, Central Hall) in the Las Vegas Convention Center and at over 100 partner booths from April 23-27, 2022.


Pricing and Availability


Starting today, Frame.io for Creative Cloud will be pre-installed with Premiere Pro and After Effects. Creative Cloud customers can log into Frame.io from within Premiere Pro or After Effects using their Adobe ID. Updates to Premiere Pro and After Effects apps are rolling out globally to users today and will be available to all entitled members later this week.

29,"Tuesday, April 12, 2022 08:00 AM",Adobe Digital Price Index: Online Inflation Remains Elevated at 3.6%,"


Apparel prices rising faster online than offline


Prices for groceries continue to surge, hitting another record high at 9.0%


Demand for e-commerce remains strong, despite higher prices

 SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) today announced the latest online inflation data from the Adobe Digital Price Index (DPI). In March 2022, online prices increased 3.6%year-over-year (YoY) and 0.3% month-over-month (MoM), matching the record YoY high in February 2022. This marks the 22nd consecutive month of YoY inflation online. In March, prices for apparel increased 16.3% YoY (up 0.3% MoM), more than any other category.



Price Table (Graphic: Business Wire)


Grocery prices continued to surge and rose 9.0% YoY (up 1.4% MoM), a new record. Prices for everyday staples including pet products increased 7.0% YoY (up 1.5% MoM), and personal care items increased 1.4% YoY (up 0.1% MoM). Despite higher prices and supply chain challenges that drove 3.1 billion out-of-stock messages in March, demand for e-commerce remained strong. Consumers spent $83.1 billion (up 7% YoY), a significant increase from $67 billion in February, as the digital economy continued to shift to more personalized customer experiences.


The DPI provides the most comprehensive view into how much consumers pay for goods online. Powered by Adobe Analytics, it analyzes one trillion visits to retail sites and over 100 million SKUs across 18 product categories: electronics, apparel, appliances, books, toys, computers, groceries, furniture/bedding, tools/home improvement, home/garden, pet products, jewelry, medical equipment/supplies, sporting goods, personal care products, flowers/related gifts, non-prescription drug and office supplies.


“Consumers are feeling a greater hit to their pocketbooks, with consistently high levels of online inflation in categories such as groceries and pet products,” said Patrick Brown, vice president of growth marketing and insights, Adobe. “But while e-commerce prices have risen more than years past, durable demand shows that consumers are embracing more personalized experiences in the digital economy as well as the conveniences of online shopping, particularly for growing categories like groceries.”


Over the last 12 months, apparel has consistently outpaced the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which captures prices that consumers pay for goods offline. In February, apparel prices rose 11.0% in the DPI, compared to 3.1% in the CPI (indexed to 2014). Non-prescription drugs followed a similar trend, with the DPI up 7.9% and the CPI down 1.2% in February. For everyday staples like groceries and pet products, online prices now move in tandem with the CPI.


In March, 14 of the 18 categories tracked by the DPI saw YoY price increases, with apparel rising the most. Price drops were observed in four categories: electronics, jewelry, toys and computers.


On a MoM basis, 12 of the 18 categories saw March price increases, with price drops observed in categories including electronics, books, toys, flowers/related gifts, computers and sporting goods.


Notable Categories in the Adobe Digital Price Index for March:



Apparel: Prices were up 16.3% YoY (up 0.3% MoM), with the category now seeing a full year of online inflation. In this time period, apparel prices online also outpaced the CPI. This reverses the longstanding pattern for the category, where seasonal discounts created predictable peaks and valleys in online prices.




Groceries: Prices were up 9.0% YoY (up 1.4% MoM), the highest increase for the category on an annual basis. Grocery prices online have been surging, up from a 7.6% YoY increase in February and 5.8% YoY increase in January. In May 2021, prices were up by just 0.4% YoY. March now marks the 26th consecutive month where online prices have risen for groceries, and it is the only category to move in lockstep with the CPI on a long-term basis.




Pet Products: Online inflation is accelerating for the category as prices rose 7.0% YoY (up 1.5% MoM). It follows a 5.6% YoY increase in February and 4.7% YoY increase in January. Prices for pet products have risen for nearly two years (23 consecutive months), following the rise in demand as more consumers brought pets into their homes. During the last holiday season (2021), online sales for pet products were up by 63% versus pre-season levels.




Personal Care Products: Prices were up 1.4% YoY (up 0.1% MoM), marking the fourth consecutive month of online inflation after prices decreased 0.9% YoY in November 2021. Prior to the pandemic (before March 2020), online price increases were unusual for the category, with only two months seeing YoY online inflation over 1% (November 2017 up 2.4% YoY and December 2017 up 1.2% YoY).




Tools and Home Improvement: Prices were up 8.5% YoY (up 1.1% MoM), the highest increase for the category on an annual basis. In February, prices were up 7.8% YoY. March also marks the 16th consecutive month of YoY inflation for the category, as consumers continue to invest in the upkeep and maintenance of their homes.



Methodology


The DPI is modeled after the Consumer Price Index (CPI), published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and uses the Fisher Price Index to track online prices. The Fisher Price Index uses quantities of matched products purchased in the current period (month) and a previous period (previous month) to calculate the price changes by category. Adobe’s analysis is weighted by the real quantities of the products purchased in the two adjacent months.


Adobe uses a combination of Adobe Sensei, Adobe’s AI and machine learning framework, and manual effort to segment the products into the categories defined by the CPI manual. The methodology was first developed alongside renowned economists Austan Goolsbee and Pete Klenow.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information


Adobe continues to provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but believes evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Adobe's operating results. Adobe believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management.


Adobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information as well as non-GAAP measures, which may exclude items such as stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles, investment gains and losses, the related tax impact of all of these items, income tax adjustments, and the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Adobe uses these non-GAAP measures in order to assess the performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods. Whenever such a non-GAAP measure is used, Adobe provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above.

31,"Thursday, March 17, 2022 04:05 PM",Adobe Recommends Stockholders Reject “Mini-Tender” Offer by Tutanota LLC,"
SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) today announced that it recently became aware of an unsolicited ""mini-tender"" offer by Tutanota LLC (“Tutanota”) to purchase up to one hundred thousand shares of Adobe's common stock, representing significantly less than one percent of Adobe's common stock outstanding. The offer price of $500 per share is conditioned on, among other things, the closing price per share of Adobe's common stock exceeding $500 per share on the last trading day before the offer expires. This means that unless Tutanota waives this condition, Adobe stockholders who tender their shares in the offer will receive a below-market price. Adobe cautions stockholders that Tutanota can extend the offer for successive periods of 45 to 180 days, in which case payment would be delayed beyond the scheduled expiration date of Friday, April 8, 2022. There is no guarantee the conditions of the offer will be satisfied.


Adobe recommends that stockholders do not tender their shares in response to Tutanota's offer because the offer is at a price below a conditional market price for Adobe's common stock and subject to numerous additional conditions. Stockholders who have already tendered their shares may withdraw them at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on Friday, April 8, 2022, in accordance with the offering documents.


Adobe does not endorse Tutanota's unsolicited mini-tender offer and is not associated in any way with Tutanota, its mini-tender offer, or its mini-tender offer documents.


Tutanota's mini-tender offer seeks less than five percent of Adobe's outstanding common stock. Mini-tender offers seek to acquire less than five percent of a company's outstanding shares, thereby avoiding many disclosure and procedural requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC“) that apply to offers for more than five percent of a company's outstanding shares. As a result, mini-tender offers do not provide investors with the same level of protections as provided by larger tender offers under U.S. securities laws. Tutanota has made similar unsolicited mini-tender offers for stock of other public companies.


The SEC has cautioned investors about these offers, noting that “some bidders make mini-tender offers at below-market prices, hoping that they will catch investors off guard if the investors do not compare the offer price to the current market price.” The SEC's guidance to investors on mini-tenders is available at https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsminitendhtm.html.


Adobe encourages brokers and dealers, as well as other market participants, to review the SEC's letter regarding broker-dealer mini-tender offer dissemination and disclosure at https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/minitenders/sia072401.htm.


Stockholders should obtain current market quotations for their shares, consult with their broker or financial advisor, and exercise caution with respect to Tutanota's mini-tender offer. Adobe requests that a copy of this news release be included with all distributions of materials related to Tutanota's mini-tender offer related to Adobe's common stock.

The BMW Group continues to expand its partnership with Adobe as part of its digital transformation of marketing and sales


Partnership will produce seamless online and offline experiences, including customized vehicles, doorstop delivery and post-purchase services 

 MUNICH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) today announced that BMW Group (BMWYY), one of the world’s largest automobile and motorcycle manufacturers, has expanded its relationship with Adobe as part of its digital transformation of its sales and marketing division. BMW Group, which includes BMW, Rolls-Royce, MINI and BMW Motorrad, is leveraging Adobe Experience Cloud to deliver personalized digital experiences, as it advances toward the goal of selling a quarter of all its vehicles online within the next three years.


With a data-driven, personalized approach, BMW Group will provide customers with seamless online and offline experiences, including customized vehicles, doorstep delivery and personalized post-purchase services.


“Our goal is to provide our customers with the same superior service whether they interact with our businesses online or offline,” said Jens Thiemer, senior vice president Customer & Brand BMW at BMW Group. “Adobe technology gives us real-time data and insights that enable us to deliver personalized experiences to our customers that build trust and create relevance. For us, this is the optimal connection between Human Centricity and Tech Magic.”


“Customers want experiences that are tailored toward their individual interests and needs,” said Anil Chakravarthy, president, Digital Experience Business at Adobe. ""The BMW Group impressively demonstrates that it serves the premium segment with a premium experience across all touchpoints. This creates trusted, loyal relationships with customers. We are delighted to support the BMW Group as a partner in its digital transformation.”


Data-Driven Approach Brings Dealerships and Digital Together


Today, customers use a variety of touchpoints to engage with an automotive brand, both online – through company websites or social media channels – and offline on the showroom floor. To unite the two, BMW Group is using the integrated capabilities of Adobe Experience Cloud to intelligently link physical retail with online shopping and deliver well-targeted and connected customer experiences across all channels. This also includes a consistent focus on the protection of personal data. For this reason, the BMW Group only uses information that customers have individually authorized.


For example, prospects can obtain detailed information about vehicles and services on the BMW Group's website and use an online configurator to put together their dream vehicle based on their personal requirements in the future. The purchase can be completed directly online, with the vehicle delivered to the customer’s doorstep on request. Customers also have the option of paying a visit to their trusted car dealer who, using details from the buyer’s online history, will put the finishing details on a vehicle customized to the consumer’s preferences.


Using the data-driven capabilities of Adobe Experience Cloud, BMW Group can make personalized and relevant recommendations. Relevant information includes their purchase history and important data that customers provide after purchasing their vehicle. This allows BMW Group to suggest additional services or technical options tailored to customers’ individual preferences to maximize the driving experience.


Building Trust with Customers in the Digital Era


By personalizing digital experiences with Adobe Experience Cloud, the BMW Group has an opportunity to build even closer, more trusted relationships with its customers. Adobe’s innovations provide solutions for content creation, asset management, content velocity and streamlined workflows that deliver experiences at the scale and premium quality customers demand.


In addition to Adobe Experience Cloud, BMW Group uses Adobe Creative Cloud for Enterprise, as well as Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Acrobat Sign. With the full range of creative applications at its fingertips, BMW Group is able to create high quality content at scale to engage with customers on every step on their journey.

“Adobe Real-Time CDP is a market-leading customer data platform that allows brands to build actionable unified profiles to create tailored customer journeys that build customer loyalty and trust,” said Mila D’Antonio, principal analyst of Omdia’s Business Platforms and Applications. “The widespread adoption of Real-Time CDP across a range of industries translates to brands being able to deliver proactive and relevant experiences to millions of customers in real-time.”


New Real-Time CDP Capabilities Power Next-generation Customer Experiences


With Real-Time CDP, Adobe continues to transform how brands engage with their audiences by unlocking new capabilities, including data collection, enrichment and distribution at a market-leading scale. Adobe delivers real-time data with more than 24 trillion audience segment evaluations and over one petabyte of data processed on average per day. Innovations include:



Instant personalization with Adobe Target: Adobe Target makes it possible to activate customer insights at record speed. The integration of Adobe Real-Time CDP with Adobe Target enables brands to leverage complete customer profiles composed of online and offline data for improved experiences. Customer digital engagement data is collected and tied to a customer profile that is then qualified for an audience segment and delivered as personalized content – all in milliseconds. This allows customer insights to be analyzed and turned into personalized experiences on websites and mobile apps in the blink of an eye.




Implementing marketing consent and preferences: To deliver personalized customer experiences that build trust, brands need to safely collect, activate and store customer insights and consent data. With OneTrust’s consent management platform integrated with Adobe Experience Platform, brands can build unified profiles that include consent and preference data. Direct integration with OneTrust allows brands to ingest consent data directly into Real-Time CDP, making it easy to implement consumer consent and preferences and glean key insights from consumer preferences to deliver improved, privacy-conscious experiences.




Real-Time CDP connections: Brands can now streamline data collection, enrichment and distribution with a fast, low-code implementation to drive accelerated time-to-value for real-time personalization based on behavioral events. Real-Time CDP Connections offers real-time performance with Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network’s geographically distributed servers. This enables the fast distribution of data with high fidelity while also allowing brands to send data from Adobe’s servers to Adobe and non-Adobe destinations.




B2B intelligence: With Adobe Sensei, Adobe’s AI engine, brands can scale their marketing efforts and deliver personalized experiences at scale. Adobe Real-Time CDP B2B Edition supplies businesses with predictive intelligence around a user’s intent to purchase. A new integration with Adobe Marketo Measure provides business-to-business (B2B) companies with unparalleled pipeline and revenue attribution.




Build rich customer profiles with key data from Adobe Commerce: To help brands further customize shopping experiences, Adobe Commerce links commerce data – such as shoppers’ browsing or purchase history – to Real-Time CDP and other Adobe Experience Cloud applications. This empowers brands to analyze customer behavior, build rich customer profiles and deliver personalized shopping journeys that drive sales, retention and loyalty. The capability is expected to be available in the second half of the year.

Adobe’s AI capabilities offer unprecedented levels of personalization, prediction and insights


Marketing Mix Modeling analyzes marketing spend in real-time, recommends shifts in spending

 SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
At Adobe Summit – The Digital Experience Conference, Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) announced new capabilities powered by Adobe Sensei, Adobe’s artificial intelligence (AI) engine, that are embedded throughout Adobe Experience Cloud. These new capabilities – which enable businesses to deliver seamless customer journeys – build upon hundreds of AI and machine learning (ML) innovations that are already embedded throughout Adobe’s products. Over 80% of Adobe Experience Cloud customers already use AI features to power their digital experiences. The AI capabilities announced today include product recommendations, live search results, intelligent budget forecasting and allocation, cross-channel budget optimization and intelligent content creation and delivery.


“With Adobe Sensei, Adobe’s AI engine, it’s now possible to achieve things that were previously beyond imagination, like having millions of one-on-one interactions with customers at the same time, and in real-time,” said Adobe Fellow Anil Kamath. “Adobe has been in the AI game for more than 15 years, and we’re able to leverage trillions of data and content assets to provide businesses with the insights that drive customer behavior.”


New AI and ML capabilities embedded throughout Adobe Experience Cloud provide brands with additional opportunities to drive greater efficiency, revenue and business growth, including:



Sales opportunity predictions (Adobe Real-Time CDP): With multiple people in a buying team and multiple touchpoints across digital and physical interactions, determining which buying teams are likely to purchase can be challenging. It requires combining and analyzing data from various technologies and complex calculations. By applying Predictive Lead and Account Scoring to insights within Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform (CDP), B2B marketing teams can focus their resources on the right prospects. They can easily determine when it is the right time for sales teams to engage with prospective buyers based on how their behavior resembles that of actual buyers. This capability will also be available with Adobe Marketo Engage later this year.




Cross-channel budget optimization (Customer Journey Analytics): Getting a complete picture of how campaigns perform across the entire customer journey can be a challenge. Now attribution models from Attribution AI can be incorporated into Customer Journey Analytics, giving brands a unified view of how online and offline campaigns are performing. Customers also benefit from return on investment (ROI) insights and the ability to configure attribution models that best fit their business.




AI-driven product recommendations and live search results (Adobe Commerce): With AI-driven product recommendations in Adobe Commerce, business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) brands can leverage AI to suggest relevant products based on shopper behavior, product sales, product features, visual elements and popular trends. This provides a tailored experience for the shopper and improves merchants’ conversion, retention, cross-sell and up-sell motions. Live Search from Adobe Commerce combines real-time catalog data with the AI capabilities of Adobe Sensei to enable ultra-fast, highly relevant and personalized search results. Adobe Sensei helps merchants identify search facets automatically for each shopper query, so they don’t have to spend time writing long and cumbersome site search rules.




Intelligent budget forecasting and allocation (Attribution AI): Accurately forecasting and allocating marketing budgets can be challenging for today’s brands. Historical data often serves as a key data point but may not reflect the fast-paced shifts in consumer preferences, especially on digital channels. Adobe is simplifying the process with a new AI-driven capability – Marketing Mix Modeling. This advanced predictive modeling capability combines historical data with real-time insights from Adobe’s Attribution AI service to help brands easily and accurately analyze marketing spend and campaign performance for the most effective offline and online channels.



During “Sneaks” at Adobe Summit, Adobe will also provide attendees with a sneak peek of several AI innovations from Adobe’s research labs focused on helping brands build great customer experiences. The ‘Go Beyond Conversion’ sneak, for example, uses AI to create customer experience scores on brand websites. Brands can learn how site visitors interact with content and direct customers to improved experiences to increase conversion.


“Personalized customer experiences are a key differentiator for brands in today’s digital economy,” said Ritu Jyoti, IDC group vice president, Worldwide Artificial Intelligence and Automation Research. “For brands to deliver the experiences consumers value they need AI technology, like Adobe Sensei, to analyze customer data, predict behavior and ultimately power the delivery of contextually relevant experiences quickly, even from the first interaction.”


All of Adobe’s AI initiatives are guided by principles of accountability, responsibility and transparency. Adobe holds itself to the highest standards for developing AI ethically, responsibly and inclusive of Adobe’s customers and communities.

Adobe Experience Cloud for Healthcare empowers healthcare enterprises to safely transform consumer insights into personalized experiences


Data capabilities unlock use cases across the entire healthcare ecosystem


Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform, Adobe Journey Optimizer and Adobe Customer Journey Analytics latest applications to become HIPAA-ready

 SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
At Adobe Summit – The Digital Experience Conference, Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) announced the general availability of Adobe Experience Cloud for Healthcare, a solution that empowers healthcare enterprises to deliver seamless customer journeys with personalized and secure digital experiences. More patients have become accustomed to accessing healthcare experiences digitally, and due to the confidential nature of healthcare, businesses operating in the space need to ensure these digital experiences are tailored to meet the individual needs of consumers, whether online, over the phone or in the office.


Adobe Experience Cloud for Healthcare enables healthcare and life sciences companies to unlock and activate robust health and behavioral insights that can shape everything from member acquisition and retention to connected health. The solution will enable healthcare enterprises to securely deliver consumer-grade experiences and empower consumers to actively participate in their healthcare.


“As consumers become increasingly comfortable with digital experiences, it’s incumbent on healthcare enterprises to offer the same trusted personal experiences both online and in the office,” said Stephen Frieder, head of global sales at Adobe. “Now with Adobe Experience Cloud for Healthcare, healthcare enterprises can build trust, improve wellness outcomes and personalize the experience with critical insights.”


Adobe Experience Cloud for Healthcare unlocks capabilities across the health and life sciences industries, including:



Healthcare providers: With Adobe Experience Cloud for Healthcare, providers can give consumers more choices when it comes to managing their care. Consumers can let their providers know their preferred channel for communications, such as receiving appointment reminders or care management tips by text or email. Providers can then combine this preference data with other health data to provide consumers with a seamless and connected experience, leading to improved care and customer loyalty.




Insurance companies: The complexity of the healthcare ecosystem can be overwhelming for healthcare consumers. With the data insights available within Adobe Experience Cloud for Healthcare, insurance companies can help their members navigate the healthcare system while reducing costs. For example, by utilizing a single view of member activities across channels (including claims, website visits online chat or phone support), payors (insurance companies) can take a holistic view of their members and their care. Payors will be able to provide personalized recommendations for everything from in-network specialists to scheduling wellness exams.




Pharmacies: Adobe’s breadth of omnichannel capabilities enables pharmacies to personalize and unify in-store and digital experiences for visitors. With Adobe Experience Cloud for Healthcare, pharmacies can leverage an accurate understanding of their visitors’ behavioral and health data so they can send timely, automated prescription alerts and reminders. Pharmacies can also automate data-driven offers that can build customer loyalty and drive business growth.




Life sciences companies: Life sciences companies can use Adobe Experience Cloud for Healthcare to engage providers and participants with timely information on the right channels. This includes safe access to real-world healthcare data, which can be used to identify patients for relevant trials. The platform also enables companies to send reminders to trial participants along with pertinent information specific to their treatment.



Healthcare enterprises reimagining the customer experience with Adobe include Change Healthcare, CommonSpirit Health, Eli Lilly, GE Healthcare, Mercy Health, Pfizer, Roche Diagnostics, Thermo Fisher Scientific and Walgreens Boots Alliance.


Trusted and Secure Patient Experiences


Healthcare enterprises will be able to use Adobe Experience Cloud for Healthcare to safely and securely leverage health data for tailoring the healthcare consumer experience. Healthcare enterprises are already using HIPAA-ready applications, including Adobe Marketo Engage, Adobe Experience Manager as a Managed Service, Adobe Connect as a Managed Service, Adobe Acrobat Sign and Adobe Workfront to create and deliver personalized digital experiences. Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform (CDP) is expected to be HIPAA-ready in May 2022, giving healthcare enterprises the ability to bring together a complete view of healthcare consumers. Adobe Customer Journey Analytics and Adobe Journey Optimizer are expected to be HIPAA-ready later this year, empowering healthcare enterprises to turn actionable insights into connected, personalized healthcare experiences.

 SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
At Adobe Summit – The Digital Experience Conference, Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) announced a series of innovations, integrations and investments designed to position brands to succeed in the metaverse.


Building upon the capabilities Adobe currently offers for creating immersive 3D experiences, e-commerce platforms and digital experiences, Adobe announced innovations for designing, creating and delivering engaging and realistic virtual experiences to millions of users.

Adobe also released a playbook for brands and previewed its upcoming Substance 3D Modeler as well as augmented reality (AR) shopping tools. In addition, Adobe unveiled collaborations with leading brands – including The Coca-Cola Company, Epic Games, NASCAR and NVIDIA – on an array of technology advances and experiences that include the key ingredients of metaverse readiness:



3D and other immersive content creation: Today’s immersive experiences, including games and interactive commerce and educational experiences, are largely built using Adobe’s industry-leading 3D and immersive content creation tools, Substance 3D and Aero. Smart brands are using 3D design workflows, such as virtual photography with tools like Substance Stager, to make their product design and marketing content production better, faster and more efficient.




Virtual commerce experiences: Today, Adobe works with thousands of businesses to power digital storefronts and other e-commerce experiences.

Portability of virtual identities and possessions: Today, Adobe empowers brands to deliver unified, personalized digital experiences to their customers, no matter where they are or what channel they’re engaging. Adobe is building on its expertise to enable users in the metaverse and other immersive experiences to design their unique online personas and possessions and use these customized assets inside of virtual worlds.

As Adobe moves to integrate its creative 3D and immersive tools with Adobe Experience Cloud, its first integrations planned are Adobe Commerce, Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Analytics and Adobe Target. Previously, Adobe announced tighter integration of 3D content, effects and capabilities across its portfolio of Creative Cloud applications.


“As the web evolves, there will be greater demand than ever for data-driven, immersive experiences that include e-commerce, multi-user functionality and the ability to own and export customized versions of your identity and possessions across virtual worlds,” said Anil Chakravarthy, president, Digital Experience Business, Adobe. “Adobe Experience Cloud will be integral to brands’ efforts to build personalized, immersive experiences such as these.”

Groceries now a major category online, expected to top $85 billion in online sales in 2022


With inflation, U.S. consumers paid $32 billion more for the same amount of goods


“Buy Now Pay Later” and curbside pickup continue to reshape online shopping


U.S. consumers to spend over $1 trillion online in 2022, a new record

 SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
At Adobe Summit, Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) today released new U.S. e-commerce data looking at how two years of COVID-19 reshaped the digital economy and its impact on the future.



(Graphic: Business Wire)


After two years of the pandemic (March 2020 through February 2022), U.S. consumers spent $1.7 trillion online, $609 billion more than the two preceding years. Demand remained strong in 2021 with $885 billion in online spend, up 8.9% year-over-year (YoY). As the digital economy shifts to more personalized customer experiences, Adobe expects the annual online spend in the U.S. to surpass $1 trillion for the first time in 2022. And as the digital economy expands, new Adobe data reveals trends and new consumer shopping behaviors:


Inflation Contributes to E-Commerce Growth


Of the $1.7 trillion spent by consumers, $32 billion was driven by higher prices. In other words, consumers paid $32 billion more for the same amount of goods. Online inflation, first observed in June 2020, has persisted for 21 consecutive months. The impact was most notable in 2021, where $22 billion of e-commerce growth was driven by higher prices compared to just $4.7 billion in 2020.


In the first two months of 2022, $3.8 billion in e-commerce growth was driven by higher prices. Inflation has not deterred demand, however, with the same two months driving $138 billion in online spend, up 13.8% YoY. In 2022, Adobe expects consumers could pay as much as $27 billion more online for the same amount of goods due to inflation.


Groceries Become a Major E-Commerce Category


In 2021, 41.8% of e-commerce overall was driven by just three categories: groceries, electronics and apparel. The pandemic has impacted the trajectory of each one:



Groceries: 2020 was a breakout year for the category, with $73.7 billion spent online, surging 103% YoY ($79.2 billion in 2021, up 7.2% YoY). Groceries is now 8.9% of the e-commerce share overall, up from 6.3% in 2019 and down slightly from 2020 (9.1%) when demand surged early in the pandemic. Consumers now spend an average of $6.7 billion each month for groceries, up from $3.1 billion pre-pandemic. Adobe expects the category to top $85 billion in 2022.




Electronics: As the largest e-commerce category, electronics drove $165 billion in online spend in 2021, up 8% YoY. This represents an 18.6% share of e-commerce overall, down slightly from 2020 (18.8%) and 2019 (21%) as other categories grew. The pandemic cemented electronics as the top category, with consumers spending $152.7 billion in 2020, up a significant 26.8% YoY. U.S. consumers now spend an average of $13.6 billion each month for electronics, up from $9.9 billion pre-pandemic. Adobe expects the category to top $174 billion in 2022.




Apparel: As consumers spent more time at home, apparel demand slumped. In 2020, apparel grew by 9.1% YoY ($115.8 billion) as e-commerce overall grew by 41% YoY. Growth was modest in 2021 at $126.2 billion, up 8% YoY. This represents a 14.3% of e-commerce share overall, down from 2019 (18.5%) and in line with 2020 (14.2%). Pre-pandemic, apparel spend in 2019 was $14.4 billion behind electronics. By 2021, the gap widened to $38.8 billion. Apparel is still a major category, with consumers spending an average of $10.2 billion each month, up from $8.7 billion pre-pandemic. Adobe expects the category to top $130 billion in 2022.



“E-commerce is being reshaped by grocery shopping, a category with minimal discounting compared to legacy categories like electronics and apparel,” said Patrick Brown, vice president of growth marketing and insights, Adobe. “It highlights a shift in the digital economy, where speed and convenience are becoming just as important as cost savings.”


Additional Insights



Out-of-Stock: Consumers have seen 60 billion out-of-stock (OOS) messages in the last 24 months (March 2020 to February 2022), in the face of supply chain constraints. The odds of seeing an OOS message are now one in 59 pages, up from one in 200 pages pre-pandemic (a 235% increase). In the last four months (November 2021 through February 2022), consumers have seen over 12 billion OOS messages, a trend expected to persist in 2022.




Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL): As consumers spent more online during the pandemic and looked for new ways to manage their money, BNPL orders between October and November 2020 increased 528% YoY while revenue grew 412% YoY. In recent months, growth has slowed, but demand remained strong: BNPL orders are up 53% YoY while revenue is up 56% YoY.




Curbside Pickup: The fulfillment method already saw strong adoption before the pandemic, but health and safety concerns gave it a boost. The demand has been durable, with many consumers now valuing the speed and convenience. In 2022 so far, curbside pickup accounted for 20% of all online orders (for retailers who offer the service), establishing itself as a major fulfilment method.



Methodology
The Adobe Digital Economy Index offers the most comprehensive set of insights of its kind, based on analysis through Adobe Analytics that covers over one trillion visits to U.S. retail sites and over 100 million SKUs in 18 product categories—more than any other technology company or research organization. Online inflation insights, from the Adobe Digital Price Index, is modeled after the Consumer Price Index (CPI), published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and uses the Fisher Price Index to track online prices. The Fisher Price Index uses quantities of matched products purchased in the current period (month) and a previous period (previous month) to calculate the price changes by category.


Adobe’s analysis is weighted by the real quantities of the products purchased in the two adjacent months. Adobe uses a combination of Adobe Sensei, Adobe’s AI and machine learning framework, and manual effort to segment the products into the categories defined by the CPI manual. The methodology was first developed alongside renowned economists Austan Goolsbee and Pete Klenow.

February marked 21st consecutive month of online inflation


Prices for tools and home improvement hit record high


Apparel prices rose more than any other category, up 16.7% year-over-year 


  SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) today announced the latest online inflation data from the Adobe Digital Price Index (DPI). In February 2022, online prices increased 3.6%year-over-year (YoY) and 0.1% month-over-month (MoM). This is a new record high, after the previous record in November 2021 when prices rose 3.5% YoY. It marks the 21st consecutive month of YoY online inflation. In February, tools and home improvement were a standout category, with prices seeing their highest annual increase at 7.8% YoY (up 0.8% MoM). Apparel increased 16.7% YoY (up 0.3% MoM), more than any other category. In groceries, prices increased 7.6% YoY (up 1.9% MoM), a record high for the category.



(Graphic: Business Wire)


The DPI provides the most comprehensive view into how much consumers pay for goods online. Powered by Adobe Analytics, it analyzes one trillion visits to retail sites and over 100 million SKUs across 18 product categories: electronics, apparel, appliances, books, toys, computers, groceries, furniture/bedding, tools/home improvement, home/garden, pet products, jewelry, medical equipment/supplies, sporting goods, personal care products, flowers/related gifts, non-prescription drugs and office supplies.


In February, 13 of the 18 categories tracked by the DPI saw YoY price increases, with apparel rising the most. Price drops were observed in five categories: electronics, jewelry, books, toys and computers.


On a MoM basis, 13 of the 18 categories saw February price increases, with price drops observed in categories including electronics, jewelry, appliances, computers and medical equipment/supplies.


Notable Categories in the Adobe Digital Price Index (February 2022)



Tools and Home Improvement: Prices were up 7.8% YoY (up 0.8% MoM), the highest increase for the category on an annual basis. The previous high point was over the 2021 holiday season, where online prices were up 7.1% YoY in December 2021. February also marks the 15th consecutive month of YoY inflation for the category.




Apparel: Prices were up 16.7% YoY (up 0.3% MoM), on par with the 2021 holiday season where prices increased 17.3% YoY in November 2021 and 16.6% in December 2021. The category has seen nearly a full year of online inflation (11 consecutive months). It is a departure from a predictable pattern pre-pandemic, where seasonal discounting drove peaks and valleys in apparel prices online.




Groceries: Prices were up 7.6% YoY (up 1.9% MoM), the highest increase for the category on an annual basis. February marks the 25th consecutive month where online prices have risen for groceries, making it the only category that has moved in lockstep with the Consumer Price Index.




Office Supplies: After eight consecutive months where online prices fell or were flat on an annual basis, office supplies were up again for a second month with prices up 1.8% YoY (up 0.3% MoM) in February. In the month prior, prices increased by 1.5% YoY (up 2.2% MoM). The unpredictability of COVID-19 variants has kept many consumers working from home still, driving up demand and prices for products in home offices.




Pet Products: Prices were up 5.6% YoY (up 1.3% MoM) and have been steadily rising for the last 10 months. In May 2021, prices were only up 0.9% YoY (up 0.1% MoM). As a newer category in e-commerce, prices have risen since May 2020, as more consumers brought pets into their homes, which boosted demand.



Methodology


The DPI is modeled after the Consumer Price Index (CPI), published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and uses the Fisher Price Index to track online prices. The Fisher Price Index uses quantities of matched products purchased in the current period (month) and a previous period (previous month) to calculate the price changes by category.

44,"Thursday, February 10, 2022 08:00 AM",Media Alert: Adobe Digital Price Index: Online Inflation Remains Elevated in January at 2.7%,"


January marked 20th consecutive month of online inflation


Prices for groceries and medical supplies hit record highs


Prices for electronics continued to drop 3.4% year-over-year

 SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 
Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) today announced the latest online inflation data from the Adobe Digital Price Index (DPI). In January 2022, online prices increased 2.7%year-over-year (YoY) and 1.1% month-over-month (MoM). This marks the 20th consecutive month of YoY online inflation. December 2021 price increases (up 3.1% YoY) contributed to a record high holiday season, during which online prices in November 2021 increased 3.5% YoY. In January, groceries were a standout category, with prices seeing their highest annual increase at 5.8% YoY (up 1.2% MoM), marking two years of online inflation for the category. Medical equipment/supplies continue to see strong YoY increases with 8.2% (-0.1% MoM), a record high YoY that coincides with a COVID-19 Omicron variant surge. Prices for electronics continue to drop (-3.4% YoY).

The DPI provides the most comprehensive view into how much consumers pay for goods online. Powered by Adobe Analytics, it analyzes one trillion visits to retail sites and over 100 million SKUs across 18 product categories: electronics, apparel, appliances, books, toys, computers, groceries, furniture/bedding, tools/home improvement, home/garden, pet products, jewelry, medical equipment/supplies, sporting goods, personal care products, flowers/related gifts, non-prescription drugs and office supplies.


“While price drops in categories like electronics and apparel have brought online inflation down slightly from the record high last November, consumers are still contending with elevated prices in the digital economy,” said Patrick Brown, vice president of growth marketing and insights, Adobe. “This is particularly notable in a category like groceries, where online prices continue to hit new records, while consumer demand for online grocery shopping remains heightened.”


In January 2022, 13 of the 18 categories tracked by the Adobe Digital Price Index saw YoY price increases, with apparel rising faster than any other category. Price drops were observed in five categories: electronics, jewelry, books, toys and computers.


On a MoM basis, 15 of the 18 categories saw January price increases, with price drops observed in three categories, including apparel, medical equipment/supplies and flowers/related gifts.


Notable Categories in the Adobe Digital Price Index (January 2022)



Groceries: Prices were up 5.8% YoY (up 1.2% MoM), the highest increase for the category on an annual basis. It exceeded the high point in October 2020, during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, when prices jumped 5.2% YoY. January marks the 24th consecutive month where online prices have risen for groceries, making it the only category that has moved in lockstep with the Consumer Price Index, which captures prices consumers pay in physical stores.




Medical Equipment and Supplies: Prices were up 8.2% YoY (down 0.1% MoM), the highest increase for the category on an annual basis. It coincided with a January surge in the COVID-19 Omicron variant, which drove greater demand for testing kits at a time when overall supply was constrained.




Office Supplies: After eight consecutive months where online prices fell or were flat on an annual basis, office supplies increased 1.5% YoY (up 2.2% MoM) in January. COVID-19 variants have kept many consumers working from home, driving up demand and prices for products in home offices.




Electronics: Prices were down 3.4% YoY, a greater price drop compared to December when online prices were down 2.6% YoY. As one of the major categories in e-commerce, electronics’ price fluctuations have had a greater impact on topline inflation. On monthly basis, prices are up 2.0% after holiday discounts seen in the prior month.




Apparel: Prices were up 15.8% YoY (down 1.7% MoM), down from the holiday season where prices increased 17.3% YoY in November 2021 and 16.6% in December 2021. The drop contributed to lower topline inflation for January, given the volume of e-commerce spending that occurs in this category.



Methodology


The DPI is modeled after the Consumer Price Index (CPI), published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and uses the Fisher Price Index to track online prices. The Fisher Price Index uses quantities of matched products purchased in the current period (month) and a previous period (previous month) to calculate the price changes by category. Adobe’s analysis is weighted by the real quantities of the products purchased in the two adjacent months.


Adobe uses a combination of Adobe Sensei, Adobe’s AI and machine learning framework, and manual effort to segment the products into the categories defined by the CPI manual. The methodology was first developed alongside renowned economists Austan Goolsbee and Pete Klenow.

The DPI provides the most comprehensive view into how much consumers pay for goods online. Powered by Adobe Analytics, it analyzes one trillion visits to retail sites and over 100 million SKUs across 18 product categories: electronics, apparel, appliances, books, toys, computers, groceries, furniture/bedding, tools/home improvement, home/garden, pet products, jewelry, medical equipment/supplies, sporting goods, personal care products, flowers/related gifts, nonprescription drugs and office supplies.


“Inflation online is showing no signs of easing, as durable consumer demand is being met with the same, persistent supply challenges that produced over six billion out-of-stock messages online this holiday season,” said Patrick Brown, vice president of growth marketing and insights, Adobe. “As consumers contend with higher offline prices for everything from gas to rent, they are finding that e-commerce is still a less expensive option when it comes to goods like toys, electronics and even jewelry.”


In December 2021, 12 of the 18 categories tracked by the DPI saw YoY price increases, with apparel rising faster than any other category. Price drops were observed in six categories: electronics, office supplies, jewelry, books, toys and computers.


On a MoM basis, 13 of the 18 categories saw December price increases, with price drops observed in five categories, including toys, pet products, home/garden, computers and flowers/related gifts.


Notable Categories in the Adobe Digital Price Index (December 2021)



Groceries: Prices were up 4.9% YoY (up 0.7% MoM), the highest increase on an annual basis since October 2020, when prices jumped 5.2% YoY. It is the only category that has moved in lockstep with the Consumer Price Index, which captures prices consumers are paying in physical stores.


Apparel: Prices were up 16.6% YoY (up 0.6% MoM). This is the ninth consecutive month where online prices have risen on an annual basis in a category that typically sees consistent periods of deflation when seasonal discounts kick in.


Appliances: Prices were up 4.1% YoY (up 3.0% MoM). This marks the 20th consecutive month of inflation for the category, at a time when consumers are keen to invest in their homes. Over the holiday season (November 1 to December 31), online sales for appliances doubled compared to pre-season (September 2021) levels. Furniture and bedding followed a similar trend, after 20 consecutive months of inflation, where December 2021 prices were up 3.3% YoY and up 0.8% MoM.


Tools & Home Improvement: Prices were up 7.1% YoY (a record high for the category) and up 1.0% MoM, marking the 13th consecutive month of online inflation as consumers continue to spend more in this category. Over the holiday season (November 1 to December 31), online sales in the category grew by 1.7 times pre-season (September 2021) levels.


Electronics: Prices were down 2.6% YoY (up 0.4% MoM). This is a greater price drop compared to November 2021, when prices for products in the category were only down 0.4% YoY and nearly moved into inflationary territory for the first time since Adobe began tracking price trends in 2014.

Methodology


The DPI is modeled after the Consumer Price Index, published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and uses the Fisher Price Index to track online prices. The Fisher Price Index uses quantities of matched products purchased in the current period (month) and a previous period (previous month) to calculate the price changes by category. Adobe’s analysis is weighted by the real quantities of the products purchased in the two adjacent months.


Adobe uses a combination of Adobe Sensei, Adobe’s AI and machine learning framework, and manual effort to segment the products into the categories defined by the CPI manual. The methodology was first developed alongside renowned economists Austan Goolsbee and Pete Klenow.
